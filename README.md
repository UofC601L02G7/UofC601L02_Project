## Introduction

The U.S. aviation industry faces a critical challenge: Spirit Airlines' strategic scheduling shifts to offset a $50 million revenue hit from staffing shortages underscore the sector's turbulence. Flight delays and cancellations disrupt travel plans, strain finances, and dampen passenger satisfaction, demanding innovative solutions. With the U.S. aviation market's global lead and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport's enduring busiest status, navigating air travel complexities is essential.

This report delves into U.S. flight delays and cancellations, scrutinizing hub hotspots and weather-vulnerable regions. By empowering travelers with delay-prone airport and airline information, this project aims to ease disruptions and enhance the flying experience.
