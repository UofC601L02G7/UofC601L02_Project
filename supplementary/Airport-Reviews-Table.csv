2024-06-15,0.2,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,airport offers zero amenities,True,  This airport offers zero amenities to the traveler. Probably the most boring place I have waited for a flight. Old equipment at TSA slows progress in getting screened. Few restaurants and even fewer bars. Zero lounges and almost no place to charge a device. It's definitely a miserable enough place that I would no longer consider a trip to New Mexico if it involves this airport!,-1,ABQ

It's 2023 and everyone needs to charge their devices. First trip to Albuquerque. Attended balloon Fiesta which brings in over 200 million. Think city could put some into upgrading airport. Not happy.,-1,ABQ

2022-05-07,0.2,Business,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,extremely disappointed in the way they handled security,True,"  I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled security. Initially I was thrilled at the process and not separating people from their luggage like so many others. However, one of my bags got 'flagged' (ended up being for a stack of business cards) and it sat waiting to be checked for over 15 minutes. During that time I asked 4 different people about it and was brushed off with comments like 'They're sending someone over' or 'I'm sure they'll take care of it"" and they just walked off. It almost made me miss my flight and was just completely NOT okay. If they had even spoken to me and treated me like a person that mattered it would have been more palatable, but this negative experience will override any positive about this airport.",-1,ABQ
2022-04-19,0.5,Solo Leisure,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements",True," ABQ is a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements. For starters: If you have TSA Pre-Check here, you're golden. Security is an efficient and friendly process. If you don't have Pre-Check, then the service, at least for a small airport, can be quite non-communicative, abrasive and slow. The pueblo-inspired architecture and interior design of the airport render it one of the most beautiful small airports in the USA, and the post-security viewing area of the runway and mountains is the sort of thing that more airports in this country need. However, it's not always easy to enjoy the design and the views when the tile and carpet flooring and seating throughout the airport are dirty and, for a lack of better words, dilapidated and outdated. Speaking of seating, there really isn't enough of it, in my opinion. The signage directing you to amenities, services and locations throughout the airport is helpful, but also outdated. The dining and shopping options are fine for a small airport, so no real complaints. Some people complain about the rental car facility being separate from the terminal and requiring a shuttle bus, but, honestly, the bus runs frequently and the ride is pretty short. Everything is easily accessible from I-25 and downtown Albuquerque. With a little modernization and polishing, ABQ has the potential be as good as new again.",1,ABQ

I have had horrid customer service in December 2020 and January 2021. I had a female ticketing agent charge me $170 for 1 overweight bag (54 lbs) because she claimed my husband's military orders were dated in March. Orders aren't posted the month you transfer ma'am. As a 17 year active duty wife, I may know a thing or two. Then said ""just because you are a military dependent doesn't mean you get free luggage"". I never in my life have experienced such horrid disrespect. On top of it I am a COVID crisis relief RN. I was blown away and have since vowed to never fly American again.",-1,ABQ

I was flying American on May 21, my flight was delayed to the point that I wouldn’t make my transfer.

Very rude TSA, been through many time and always felt it was very quick and easier to get through other than the airport staff. Not the airline staff, they are great. But TSA are almost always rude, barely smile and speak down to people going through. Not just my family but others around us in the line, and really there is nothing you can say.

We arrived 3 hours before-my friend was flying on a slightly earlier flight and I was told to wait outside as my flight was slightly later. No preliminary information.so had to wait an hour. Finally allowed inside the building where there were 5 security checks - really strange as the checks involved the same things. After all that my friends plane was still on the tarmac as we took off.

The main lobby and check-in/ticketing area of Aspen Airport does not have a vending machine for even water. TSA did not allow already checked-in passengers to go through security and wait in the gates section due to some ""safety"" issue due to overcrowding in the gates area. We had to wait five hours. Twice I went to the bathroom and through a windowed door you could see the gate area with FEW people while the front of the airport building was overcrowded with unhappy and angry passengers. I already sent my complaint to American Airlines. This issue of no water, soda or food for hours is not acceptable in todays world. For sure I have no desire to visit Aspen due to this awful airport and airline experience.",-1,ASE

Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the horrible first impressions for foreigners entering the US. Fix it please.",-1,ATL

2024-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,a mad house with no structure,False,"   On 18 July I traveled to Hartsfield-jackson airport to pick up my daughter and family. I have traveled throughout the US, Europe and Asia. The experience in Atlanta airport was the worst in my 75 years on this earth. All parking on the domestic side was full. I was directed to the International terminal parking by one of the many rude employees there. In the end, I parked off site until my daughter arrived picking her up at exit S2. Honestly, 'the fish rots from the head down' I ask that Governor Kemp order a top down evaluation of senior management at the Atlanta airport. The place is a mad house with no structure and few employees who care a whit about the clientele. Suggest they use the airport in Seoul to model their way ahead. If the Koreans can get it so right so can we Americans.",-1,ATL
2024-07-10,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,never seen such foolishness,True,"  Never connect through ATL on an international flight. You have people getting off flights from 2 different ends of the airport and one side has to walk all the way to the other side to get in line behind hundreds of people. Once you make it through customs and show your passport, then you pick up your checked bags and redeposit them around the corner. At this point you think you are done and can head to your gate, but no. Now you have to wait in another long line to go through security again. This is after you have been on a long international flight. Like seriously, what could I have picked up from the jet bridge to standing in the customs line? You finally make it through security and then you have to catch the train to your terminal! I have never seen such foolishness! None of this makes sense at all! If I cleared security once, why should I have to do it again?  There has to be some logic, but I don't understand it!",-1,ATL
2024-07-04,0.2,Business,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,opposite from progress,False,"   A couple of illogicals at Hartsfield. Arriving from international flight to get to Marta (as instructed by 3 different staff) traveler is required to go through the security checkpoint. This not just inconveniences tired traveler arriving from international flight that has already gone through customs, but also additionally chokes always long security check lines. At domestic terminal 3 of the staff man entrance to restrooms, and if you're arriving from the ticket counter side they instruct you to go around, back through food court, by entrance to security checkpoint and only if you're arriving from that side you can enter the restroom. Not only inconvenience to traveler but also waste time of 3 if the staff. Is that really necessary? It seems Hartsfield is moving in direction opposite from progress.",1,ATL
2024-07-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,some of the most rude people,False," This was my absolute worst experience I’ve ever had in an airport. It was not just the TSA although yes, they were their typical bossy, irritating organization. But the staff trying to guide us from an international arrival through passport, control, and baggage retrieval and whatever else were some of the most rude people I’ve ever encountered. I was so upset that this was going to be some of the people on my flights first experience in the United States, and they’re being yelled at and laughed at. If you fly, you know that an unfamiliar airport can be confusing. People would ask questions. Sometimes two people would ask the same question. One person I gave my passport to just flick his wrist slightly and looked at me like this. Is your passport take it the security wanted to see inside my bag and set it aside. It sat completely unattended for 10 minutes. I didn’t want to say anything to anybody because by this point, my experience had been so lousy, I figured they would purposely extend it and I might miss my connection. Restaurants are overcrowded lines of 100 people long at a Wendy’s. Bathrooms you can’t navigate because they’re too tight and people are toting bags all over the place. Flights that get delayed are not uncommon, but they seem to be more than common at this airport. I will purposely pay extra to never have to fly through this airport again. If I never see Atlanta, I will be happy. Who has a hub there, needs to act or they are going to lose customers. Because I have zero interest of flying through their hub ever again.",-1,ATL
2024-06-10,0.3,Business,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,"worthwhile to avoid ATL"" ",False,"   This airport is to be avoided if at all possible. Like many large airports, it is very busy; unlike many other airports, though, the vast majority of staff have no interest in helping anyone. Parking is full - staff waves you away without any information about alternative lots. Baggage check lines are long, staff sits on their butts, occasionally helping a customer every 5 minutes or so. Security officers are so busy yelling instructions to everyone that they can't answer a question, then lose their marbles if you do something wrong (I took my laptop out of my case like the majority of other security lines; the women started screaming like I was a child). Most restaurants inside the airport have employees staring at their cell phones, and both the service time and food quality reflect this. The only positive I can write is that this airport does allow direct flights to many places. However, I have begun to look at other airports (e.g., Columbia, SC and Charlotte, NC) to use - the extra hour or two drive is worthwhile to avoid ATL.",-1,ATL
2024-06-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no clear directions in airport,False,"   Our first flight was a bit late, no clear directions in airport and most of the staff are mean as hell and look lost themselves. Be warned, you won't have time to get all the way across the airport and catch a connecting flight they end all boarding sessions 30 minutes early so it is very misleading and the staff are very mean spirited.",-1,ATL
2024-06-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,“the least convenient airport experience”,True," Atlanta wants to be an international city but the international terminal at Heathrow provides the least convenient airport experience I have ever encountered. On arrival in Atlanta, if you want to take public transport — the MARTA subway train — you have to get a bus from the international terminal back to the domestic terminal where the train station is located. The busses run infrequently, are hard to identify, crowded, and are manned by surly drivers, They drive you around the whole large airport so it takes around 45 minutes. We’d already waited that long for a bus just to come AND spent an hour getting through a long passport control queue. Why London airports can have e-gates you breeze through in minutes and Atlanta cannot is beyond me. If you think you’ll avoid all this hassle by renting a car, think again as to access the rental car centre you have to take the same slow airport bus to domestic PLUS then a shuttle out to the rental hub. All of it adds up to it taking a very long time to just get away from the airport after an already long international flight. Signage after baggage pick-up is also very poor which makes me feel very sorry for non-English speakers or really anyone arriving in Atlanta for the first time.",-1,ATL
2024-05-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,numerous stalls out of service,True,"  TSA wait on Monday 5/13/24 was over an hour with 3 TSA people working. I was also told that I could leave my iPad in my carryon, but at BOS Logan, that was not allowed and further it had to be placed in a separate bin. I appreciate security, and would also appreciate that they are trained properly. What else goes through unseen?  Departing BOS Delta 363 on Friday 5/17/24 arriving ATL Terminal A, the ladies restroom line spilled well out onto the concourse. When I got inside, there were numerous stalls out of service, several sinks out of service and no soap in several dispensers. Logan airport was super clean and very nice. Surely ATL can do better.",-1,ATL
2024-05-13,0.2,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Clear staff are horrible,False,"   Unfortunately this is my new home airport. I travel every other week for work from ATL to several other cities. The staff at ATL airport is by far the worst I’ve seen at any airport. Clear staff are horrible! I’ve had a problem with my ID the last 5-7 times I’ve gone through and no one has said why, then I go to New Orleans and Orlando Airport and they both told me what the issue was and how to fix it. Security and TSA are rude and power hungry. They scream across the lobby at guests, they ignore any questions and treat travelers as if we are beneath them-all because they know you will comply because you have no other choice. They are bullies. Almost anyone you speak to at the airport acts like they are annoyed that they have to do their job. I’m actually shocked when someone is friendly.",-1,ATL

During our time in this airport, we’ve had to ask where to go, what to do, etc., which is expected from newbie travelers. Every staff member, employee, and retail worker that we’ve experienced so far from McDonald’s to the Info desk has been nothing but rude. Horrible attitudes, not people friendly, and seems like they do not like taking the time out of their jobs to answer questions. I have been here for about 12 hours on a long connection, have gained very little answers to my questions, and I have met no kind people who work in this airport.",-1,ATL

Frontier is having issues with their app and were not helpful. Thought I was given a ticket, but it was not a boarding pass. After my 2nd trek back to the Frontier counter and heading for my 3rd, Kelvin not only got me fixed up and thru security quickly. I am in my late 60s and his help was greatly appreciated.",1,ATL
2024-04-29,0.6,Couple Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,just a very bad experience,True,"  My husband and I flew into Atlanta from Amsterdam on April 25, 2024. We had a connecting flight to Birmingham, AL following that flight that we needed to make. When we reached the Custom's line we realized that the line was extremely long and slow moving. We had enough of a layover where there should have been plenty of time to make it to where we needed to be, but there were only a few custom's officers working the arrival of an entire international flight. We asked for help from multiple employees so that we could make our connecting flight and were told that they could not help us. We were told that we would just have to miss our flight and reschedule it for the next day! This was extremely frustrating because we had recently had a similar experience in Amsterdam where the staff there had bent over backwards and had done everything in their power to help us make our flight.... so we knew that things could be done better. They have a system worked out to assist passengers with occurrences like these. Atlanta employees need to take a training class from the Amsterdam airport. I would have expected so much more from such a large airport (in the United States no less), for which I guess I just had higher expectations. We were able to make our connecting flight but only because we had to make a desperate run through an extremely large airport which left us feeling miserable, exhausted, and stressed. All in all, it was just a very bad experience that didn't have to happen. Do better Atlanta!!",-1,ATL
2024-04-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,“one of the worst in the USA”,True," Atlanta international airport is by far one of the worst in the USA. The customs process is excruciating, the officers don’t know how to properly separate the visitors and citizens line, the process to travel from the international terminal to domestic or for a rental car is by way of one shuttle bus that runs every 25 mins. This is by far the worst process I have ever seen in an airport, 3rd world countries do a whole better job than this, this is just flat out horrible.",-1,ATL

There is a complete ""it's not my problem"" or ""I can't help you"" attitude ingrained in the work culture there. There is no way I should be led on a wild goose chase around the airport because no one has a clue or cares to find out where I was supposed to get my connecting flight. I wasn't allowed on my flight when I got to the gate with 5 min to spare. It is appalling the lack of knowledge from the staff and then being met with shrugs. I'm absolutely disgusted with the staff there.",-1,ATL
2024-03-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,did not supply the wheelchair assistance,True,"  We had a horrible experience because they did not supply the wheelchair assistance that we requested. Our trip was from Salt Lake City to Atlanta then to Liberia, Costa Rico. Our trip home, we made a point of asking for wheelchair assistance. On our trip home, our flight was delayed an hour, so we had less time to go through customs. The wheelchair assistance was not there when we exited the terminal. There was a stray wheelchair so my wife pushed me. We kept on asking airport personnel for help and they kept on saying it is not my job. Some people offered to get someone, but that never panned out. When we picked up our bags because it was an international flight, we had three bags on the wheelchair with Ken (the person in the wheelchair) holding a wheeled 40 lb bag with a duffle bag attached to it while his wife tried to navigate to customs. At one point, a TSA official asked to take our bags, which we accepted. However we thought they would stay with us but they disappeared. We finally found the wheelchair assistance people and they did get us assistance, but was irritated that we were upset. They told us that our bags would be at our final destination and to quit worrying. They eventually took us to our terminal, although the person whined about how far it was. When we got there, the doors were closed but Delta allowed us to board. In Salt Lake, the wheelchair assistance was there and cheerfully helped us get to the luggage claim. However, I got a text from Delta stating that our luggage was still in Atlanta.",-1,ATL

I waited an hour through security so to people who did the body scan berated me about my appearance and shirt. It’s too early in the morning and not warranted to be treating your customers this way. We pay good money for flights that are overpriced anyway. The least we can get is 5-star customer service. There is obvious lack of training, lack of discipline, and lack of vetting your employees to see if they have experience working with customers. Ridiculous.",-1,ATL

We had a lay-over in Atlanta and went through customs at the Atlanta airport. We were diverted to the line with connecting flights. It took two hours to snake through the initial screening, grab our bags, go through a second line, and finally go through TSA security. The lines all moved at a glacial pace. When we finally were at TSA to X-ray the bags, there were two lines: one moved efficiently, the line we were in was a nightmare. The agents working the screening chatted with each other, stood by sipping water, and blowing battery-powered fans at their faces. My husband and I just made our connecting flight to IAD.",-1,ATL

One actually made an announcement that we needed to get on the ""same page, same chapter, same book"" because we were irritating her as it should be a quick process.

They speak to customers as if they’re angry for having to perform their jobs. Remember, who’s paying your salaries. If you’re not happy doing your job then I suggest that you go into another occupation. To add insult to injury, upon my return from a previous trip, someone had broken into my vehicle, located right next to security cameras. I reported it to the police and media and was told that the airport would pay for the repairs. That never happened. Moreover, I’m convinced that it was an inside job.",-1,ATL

Good luck finding anything with the lack of signage and the nasty attitude exhibited by all employees.

TSA in Atlanta airport has the most inefficient and rude staff I have encountered at any airport. They all need a course on customer service. I arrived at 9pm at the domestic departure, experienced Long line 200+ passengers were waiting and only 3 security tables were open!  Staff were rude and useless. TSA and CLEAR closed early and there's no special lane to handle the irregular cases. Apparently, staff were customed to observing bottlenecks and didn't even aware there was an issue! They should adjust accordingly whenever they see traffic jam, like most average airports would open more security tables at rush hour. I will avoid to transfer to ATL Hartsfield ever!",-1,ATL
2023-12-13,0.3,Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,dysfunction is the TSA process,True,"  I’ve lived outside of the US for many years and have experienced many airports all over the world. Some were good and others, not as good. Common elements I’ve found in good airports is professionalism and positive interaction with customers. My experience with the Atlanta airport contained neither of these elements. The primary area of dysfunction is the TSA process. General interaction that staff has with customers is unprofessional. No instructions given to people when approaching the document scanner, then being rude when someone is confused about the process. I did not observe any positive interaction between security staff and customers. After getting this sense, I looked for positivity and saw no eye contact or smiles, but rather what appeared to be contempt for customers. I realize that airport security would be a difficult job, and that you would feel like you are dealing with the same issue over and over. However, I have been through countless airports where security was professional and positive. Everyone has to go through security, so a good experience is crucial to a positive view of the airport. Atlanta airport has many great features, but I would not recommend it to anyone based on the TSA experience. That is how negatively it impressed me. This area should be addressed to improve service to customers and make the airport what it is capable of being.",-1,ATL

Traveling through the terminal was easy enough, and the plane train was simple. My experience though in Concourse D was tragic. It felt dreary like it was an afterthought and the two restaurants I went to acted like I was an inconvenience. The first (Mustard seed) had me sitting there for a bit before finally letting me know the kitchen was closed, at 6:45pm. And the next, all 3 employees decided they wanted to be on their phones instead of help a guest. Its sad because I grew up in ATL area and used to fly out of Hartsfield all the time. I have fond memories, but nostalgia wasn't enough to save this experience. I will probably avoid Delta just to avoid having a flight connection here",-1,ATL

ATL airport is poorly run as compared to other airports. It is always understaffed and very chaotic. There's never a wheelchair attendant available upon departure. I always have a family member push me to the gate, after obtaining a special pass. This is never necessary to do upon departing other airports, only Atlanta! They are fairly good at providing attendants upon de-planing. However, one afternoon there was 1 attendant for 7 wheelchairs. One by one she pushed us from the jetway to the terminal and there we sat for 1 hr. Those of us who could walk a little, we decided to attempt to walk to the plane train, by holding the wheelchair and walk behind it. The TSA line for wheelchair people is ridiculous. No one is there to supervise the bottleneck of abandoned wheelchairs as we wobble pass the checkpoint. Do not blame the attendants! Its not their fault! Its the fault of the upper managers because they are not doing a good job of managing! It's shameful! The last trip I took there was a manager at the TSA line who was drunk and stepping on people and bumping into us and he was loud and laughing and clowning around with workers. Atlanta airport is disgusting!",-1,ATL

TSA needs to be fully staffed and all machines working for the M-F business crowd. Also, why so hot? It’s barely fall and the airport is a balmy 80 degrees inside. Save energy, save the planet and keep it cooler. You’ve got people in the sky club stripped down to their tees. Seriously.",1,ATL
2023-10-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,nightmare of traveling through ATL,True," 1. After completing terminal F, for international travel, many years ago. Most international flights still depart from the E and T gates. 2. While the number of gates at F are limited, there is not adequate accommodation made for arriving passengers. Instead, if arriving into an E gate and it may be on either end of the concourse, they must walk about two miles, with limited moving walkways to F gate international passport control. After all of the years that have past since completion of terminal F one would expect a solution by now. 3. Being assigned for international travel at the E gates also means you suffer the absolute chaos of dining in the central part of this concourse where, for example, there is only one coffee shop, for all of terminal E. 4. Upon exiting passport control that can be hit or miss as to ordered chaos or mayhem, one has to wait upon luggage where despite at least 6 carousels, only two may be in use, each covering several flights. This does not make any sense to me. 5. If you had done the right airport recommended parking for the international Park & Ride (the receipt says Park ATL), standby for more chaos as you exit the concourse. There are several park and ride signs on different pillars along the first pavement. However unmarked is a pillar with queuing column tape that is for white (seemingly) unmarked minibuses. These are the transport to the park and ride (that by the way should say Park ATL, same as the receipt that I paid against). 6. I can only guess that those who design, upgrade or manage ATL do not travel, themselves. International arriving passengers that arrive there are often tired, disorientated and brain fogged. Even those who have travelled through ATL extensively and live in GA, are not immune to the chaos. 7. I would not say the on site staff and ATL are rude, but they are certainly not too friendly. Returning to the US feels like the first day you report for duty in the military or I guess, arrival to start a prison sentence. This is not the America I want to project and I am sure you don't either. 8. Sadly, there is no excuse for the atrocious state of ATL and it seems that someone needs to find another career. I have little desire to fly in or out of ATL, and I do not like the airline connections from my nearest airport, here in North GA. So, if anyone from Delta is reading this, yes, it affects you too, because my wife and I will be thinking twice before we undertake the nightmare of traveling through ATL again.",-1,ATL

Also motion detection for trash. Everything else that matters much more - such as getting from concourse to concourse is not good. This airport is designed poorly. I’ve never had to walk so much to where I almost miss my flight due to the time it took! The team has confusing messaging - causing everyone to get off on the wrong stops - hint: the wall has the correct concourse don’t pay attention to the lights inside (or lack thereof) bc they change colors for the next stop as the door opens- causing chaos and toes to be rolled over bc everyone is worries they will miss their flights. I went directly past concourse A due to poor signage… had to hop back on and go backwards. Lastly - the doors close even if someone is in the way- I saw a guys bag almost get ripped off as the tram took off- it warned that someone was blocking the door from Closing but started driving away -scary!

2023-08-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,the most poorly run airport,True,"  
I travel several times a year. I went to KC MO MCI arrived on Thursday 8/10/2023 absolutely love the KC new airport so efficient and organized. Surprisingly my departure from ATL was uneventful that day. I arrived back home on Sunday 8/13/203. The train to baggage claim went to T gate, so I had to get off and walk and go up an escalator that had only 2 up escalators. The elevators weren't working. We had to then snake around to the security door on the southside and go through a glass security door. The door kept getting stuck because there are hundreds or maybe even thousands of people going through this door. The door got stuck and instead of the airport employee holding the door open she is hollering and clapping her hands and snapping her fingers like she is talking dealing with a herd of cattle, or a bunch dogs. This process of the train being down and having to walk to baggage claim seems to be the normal and not the exception. The airport workers are rude and do not offer assistance at all. When you ask for help, they are rude. On another travel experience I was leaving for Houston early morning, I was at the airport by 4 am and instead of the security checkpoint being open on the North terminal, everyone had to go through the main security terminal, thousands of people at 4-5 am and their explanation was the North terminal does not open until  5: 45.

Flight cancelled and they let us wonder around this hell hole for 15 hrs. Pushing the next flight back over and over. Then sending us back and forth between terminals and every time there we fewer and fewer seat for all the passengers Most had to stand. The charging ports were not connected to a power source. They had no where for the smokers to have a much needed cig. We would have to leave completely and start over thru TSA. I will tell everyone to avoid this airport and Delta.

Busiest? Yes. Most-efficient? No. On its own, this isn't a very nice airport. When compared to airports like Reagan National, it's downright pathetic. The workers at the vendors were okay but the TSA staff were horrible. The facilities are adequate at best. They do have some nice art but they placed it outside the secured area (i.e., if you visit it, you'll be forced to go back through the slow security lines and deal with the rude TSA agents). Plus, the art is in a very high-traffic area on the way to/from baggage claims so stopping to look at anything is going to put you in the way of people who are already unhappy because they're being subjected to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. If you're stuck there overnight as I was, good luck finding food. Most of the vendors close. I was able to get food at the Burger King away from the terminals. Did I get a tasty Whopper? Nope. Burger King was out of burgers so I had to settle for something else. It wasn't very good. At least I was serenaded nearly the entire time I ate with a recorded message—Yes, they love recorded messages!—telling me that an emergency had been reported in the building and I was to stand by for further instruction (that never came).",-1,ATL

There was a lot of confusion because none of the staff did their job. Walking through I heard many arguments between staff and random people flying and 10/10 of every argument was due to the hostility from the workers. I’ve never seen such a poorly managed airport, I showed up super early and missed my flight by two minutes. Honestly if I blame anyone it would be the staff, what a waste of a billion dollar company. It’s legit TRASH. After missing my flight I had one nice person that put us on a different plane and was very helpful and kind. She was the only one out of 20 people that I ran into.

Awful!

If I hear one more person attempt to justify incompetence by citing ""Atlanta is one of the busiest airports in the world"" I think I'll scream. Busy should not foster incompetence.

2022-11-11,0.2,Business,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,no reason to be that rude and loud,False,"  Had a stressful morning which was completely my fault are forgetting my purse with all my wallets and work laptop at home. I had barely made it to the security after my Uber trip back and forth trying to get my purse. At the security check I was very nervous that I was going to miss my flight hence I was rushing and had placed my stuff in one of the containers for security checked. I place it on wrong a bucket I guess since i was in different head space but darn the lady yelled at me very rudely. She was very polite in fact was even flirting with a guy standing in front of me and her whole attitude changed when it was my turn. I understand I may have placed it on a wrong place accidentally but she had no right to yell that loud in front of everyone. I even said sorry I have a flight leaving like in 10 mins and I was trying my luck. She disregarded my apologies and proceeded to yell at me loudly second time. I was shocked , because there was no reason to be that rude and loud. Everyone at the airport was very cold and rude except the waiter at the restaurants. Everyone has a day they go though but being a little nicer would make things lot easier for everybody. TSA securities I understand you guys are tired of us but there no need to be rude somethings can be said a little nicely.",-1,ATL

Literally running Tom Cruise style through the airport to miss my flight by 5 minutes Security line was almost 1 hour at 6am in the morning! This is ridiculous.

I was so pleasantly surprised by all we experienced at Atlanta going to FL and the going home to OH. The people at all Delta counters were so nice and welcoming. The restrooms were really clean and well identified. The terminal to train from T to A was immediate, clean and well directed. We then got a Dunkin Donut, coffee and ate at catCora’s kitchen. The food was very good, beautifully presented and our waiter was so nice. Thanks Atlanta!",1,ATL
2022-09-20,0.4,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,security lines are astonishingly inefficient,True,"  The busiest airport in the world could sure stand to get its act together. To its credit, the signage to access the terminals from the highways and to leave the airport were, in my opinion, ample. The majority of personnel we met in that airport, even security, were polite and professional - the only reason I'm not giving this airport a completely flunking score. That includes personnel for both Delta and Frontier Airlines. The tram connecting the terminals is clean and wonderfully efficient. Some of the Delta SkyMiles lounges are national-class, even world-class. That's where my compliments end. Now here's the bad stuff: The airport is predominantly dirty (not as dirty as Denver or Seattle, but still pretty bad). There are few places to grab a bite to eat or something to drink pre-security. The baggage and ticket counters are cramped and narrow, unbecoming of the world's busiest airport. Most departure gates are also cramped and narrow, with little seating, also unbecoming of the world's busiest airport. The security lines are astonishingly inefficient, even by US large airport standards; using CLEAR and Pre-Check in tandem should take five minutes, even on a busy holiday or weekend - not 25+ minutes like it did. If you don't have an expedited security clearance like CLEAR or Pre-Check and have to wait in the normal line, 90+ minutes to get through security on the busiest of days isn't unheard of. Again, to security's credit, the TSA officers I met were nice enough, but there clearly aren't enough TSA officers staffed at ATL. And, to the credit of the thousands and thousands of passengers being herded like cattle, people behaved relatively orderly and politely. But thousands and thousands of passengers hourly shouldn't be beholden to the whims of government incompetence - which, like I've said, is unbecoming of the world's busiest airport.",-1,ATL
2022-09-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,,3.0,why do they provide lousy service to their guests on later flights?,True," In coming home from visiting Colorado Springs, I arrived at Atlanta airport around 1.40am and the train that you take at the gates to get to baggage claim and ground transportation was operating on a “limited schedule.” Meaning you could wait to see when and if it would come to pick you up or walk. I was exhausted, like everyone else but we all chose to walk. Based on my activity tracker, we walked about a mile! This is not the first time this happened arriving in Atlanta late. If planes are still landing at 1.50am, why is the train not operating on the normal schedule? Atlanta airport boasts beefing the busiest and most efficient airport, why do they provide lousy service to their guests on later flights? So beware of the long walk if you arrive past their normal train running schedule!!",1,ATL
2022-09-01,0.5,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,yelled at by a cleaning person,False,"  My wife and I found the cleaning staff, in particular late night arrival and early morning departure, were very rude and inpatient. We were yelled at on two occasions by the staff cleaning the floors near the plane train area because we were not directed by signs or staff which side of the cones we should be standing while waiting for the train. Again today, as I was arriving for an early morning flight, I was again yelled at by a cleaning person for being on the wrong side of her cones. There were no signs or persons available to direct foot traffic as to where to walk or not walk, just a red tape down the middle of the isle. Not a very good impression to greet guests arriving to such a busy airport.",1,ATL

However, I am so disappointed at what it has become. The bathrooms are too small and dirty, the electrical outlets for phone charging do not work, and the attendants belong in another setting. There’s no customer service anymore. I don’t care what the pandemic has brought to America, hire people who still have integrity to get the job done",-1,ATL
2022-08-06,0.5,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,continually inept at their job,False,"  On August 20, I arrived from CDG to Atlanta on Delta 8606 Terminal 1 at 5.05 having a correspondence on Delta flight 1249 at 7.55pm to Tampa. The walk from Terminal 1 at one end of the airport to Gate A02 at the other en of the airport was for me a nightmare. No cart to be found, a 20 minute walk with luggage, no other form of transportation, barely a few escalators, up and down, up again and down again to get to a train, from the train another walk. I am 75 years of age and very fit yet I was thoroughly exhausted. I had already been through 2 customs when I arrived at the one in Atlanta to board my final flight, I had with me a few purchases bought at the Duty free airport in Paris. I had a mid size bottle of liquor which the custom agent insisted had to be put in my suitcase and my suitcase checked since apparently the duty free had forgotten to wrap it in a special plastic wrapper. Even though I had a receipt form the Duty free and a gift bag, the agent in no way educated enough to comprehend the difference, sent me back to the delta counter to open my suitcase, pack the bottle and register the suitcase. Thankfully I was lucky enough to find a gentleman at the Delta check-in who assisted me and was very kind. Admittedly from a few comments heard, I was not the first victim of the lack of understanding by the customs agents. One might say they are applying the rules, however is it applying the rules or is it enforcing the little power they have to unnecessarily harass travelers -  it is my understanding that they are continually inept at their job and take extreme pleasure in adding unpleasant and totally unnecessary steps to an already tired passenger? So between this and the lack of assistance for passengers to get from one point to the other in an immense airport, I will avoid that airport at all costs.",-1,ATL
2022-08-05,0.3,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,distressed by many things at the airport,True,"  I am distressed by many things at the airport today. The Clear and Pre Check lines are about a 30 min delay. It is hard to justify paying for these services if the line is so long. When I see supervisors at the elevated podium, I wonder why they cannot jump in to help out. When I worked, even as a manager, if we were busy I stepped in to help out. Many standing around, few working. Not all screening machines/lines are open. The food service lines are also really long. 20 min to get a cup of coffee? Why not add automated lines that deliver regular coffee to the customer? 20 min to order and deliver food to me at lunch. Again, offer more grab and go if you lack staff. The Saladworks stand is closed, as usual. One employee could sell the grab/go salads and ring up! Automate the purchase of salads like La Madeline has done. Many food vendors are still not open. Please find a way to sell pre boxed salads and sandwiches if workers are in short supply. I am happy to eat a cold salad or sandwich, hummus plate etc. Restrooms are dirty. Lots of cleaning people with their carts standing around, but they seem to be busy looking at their phones, or visiting with each other, and not cleaning. Loud music in food court at Concourse C is ridiculous. It is so loud that no one can talk, or answer phone calls from customers. Turn it down. Easy fix!",-1,ATL

I feel like I’m encroaching upon peoples personal homes and spaces as I attempt to make purchases from concourse eateries (i.e. Crepes, Caribou, and Boars Head) all on concourse A. Staff seem to be plentiful but the customer service is often rude, unprofessional, and vulgar). At crepes while waiting to get my order the young lady was having a personal conversation on her phone about a side job making food. She used the “n” word often and several other vulgar words. All while waiting on me. The young ladies at Boars Head were nice but very immature. I paid $4 for a drink I ended up tossing in the trash. Speaking of trash the concourse seating area is trashy and unkept. I see cleaning carts with staff but are sitting, congregating, and on their phones. I feel like I’m in someone’s backyard uninvited. At Caribou staff appear to be disgruntled and for $6 a pop you don’t expect for them to be out of whipped cream since all pictures are featured with WC. Unfortunately, the entertainment is as trashy as the concourse. ReachTv is playing on all TVs. The profanity is used throughout the Espinosa of “magherita”. Children and adults are throughout the concourse being force to hear/see this. Surprised me that this is an international airport. If I had another choice I would take it for future travel.",-1,ATL

On our return trip through Atlanta, traveling to Orlando, we were delayed by Delta again, waiting for a flight attendant.

Why is the car hire only at domestic - adds an hour to an international journey. The food options at international are terrible. Tonight 9pm 26th May, most food options have run low.

This has been obvious for several years. However, their staff is even worse! I arrived from an international flight and had to wait in line for TSA clearance to get to my connecting flight. While waiting, a female airport employee responsible for assisting elderly international passengers in wheelchairs, literally was being abusive without any intervention from other employees or TSA. The passengers had been put in a side area for a while before she came in and started shouting in Spanish words to them. She didn't speak the language, only was able to shout certain words at them, and then starting cursing as she pulled them into the queue for TSA check. While getting their belongings for the TSA clearance, she was ripping things off of them (shawls, bags, hats etc.) and when one lady tried to hand her shoes for the bin, she moved aside and let them fall to the ground. Her behavior was irresponsible at best. Negligent and abusive to be accurate. She had no right to behave this way.",-1,ATL
2022-05-17,0.3,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,international terminal at ATL is an absolute embarrassment,False,"  The international terminal at ATL is an absolute embarrassment. Back in the 1990s ATL was a slick and efficient modern airport with decent facilities and efficient ground transportation. The international terminal was inadequate from new and has never been improved. 15 minute bus ride from the rental car centre is just the start of the problems. Chaotic check-in zone, unnecessary delays for security, poor food selection, poor seating. The whole thing falls a long way below modern standards. Avoid if possible.",-1,ATL

I got through security quickly and everyone was fine: brisk and not overly friendly, but doing their job. Bad: Surely whoever sells the food selection could do better. One place for coffee (Starbucks) with a 50-60 person lineup. No-where else to buy coffee at 8 in the morning. One choice in breakfast food, except they didn’t have many of the choices. Otherwise there is a Chinese food place and a hamburger/hotdog place. There was one place behind bars that might open later and a sit-down restaurant, also closed, so who knows. Overall, if you have a longer connection time or your flight is delayed, fingers cross that you are not stuck in Altanta Int’l concourse.",-1,ATL
2022-05-07,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,the place is hopeless,False,"  Words almost fail me. I was transiting Atlanta on my way back to the UK from Jamaica. My duty free bottle of rum ($70 worth), sealed in a globally recognized bona-fide plastic bag, was singled out for an X-ray which it ""failed"". I was told to go back to the other side of security to check the bottle into hold baggage, despite my protestations that (a) it would likely get broken and (b) I therefore have to go through the whole security process again. I was then sent back to the Virgin check in desk since Delta could not process this action. Suffice to say the Virgin check in desk was not yet open. So two hours of my life wasted because the TSA X-ray machine cannot distinguish between high quality booze and something more dangerous. I still cannot decide whether this is just vindictiveness or utterly useless technology/staff. Avoid at all cost, the place is hopeless and the staff are rude beyond description.",-1,ATL

Arrived from San Jose, Costa Rica on time but had to sit in the plane for an extra 40 min because there was nobody to park the plane at the gate according to the pilot’s announcement. As a globetrotter I had never heard of such thing especially when Atlanta boasts the busiest airport and most efficient one in the world! Preposterous! My husband had requested a wheelchair on arrival and assistance. To our dismay there were no attendants at the gate. We waited until all passengers had left the sleeve and I ended up pushing the w/c through customs. We both have respiratory conditions and he has knee surgeries. The next flight to SYR was delayed, We boarded eventually and after another hour of sitting in the plane ready for take off, the pilot announced that due to storm and the crews expired time, passengers have to leave aircraft and go back to concourse A, which involves distance and riding the train. The line at the customer service was so long that it took 5 hours or 1am till 5am to finally be rebooked. Disaster airport and only three ticket agents working! As a former travel agent and world traveler, would recommend more employees and better customer service.",-1,ATL

For example, at the check in 3/4 at 6.50 am I was told to walk forward and simultaneously push my items through on a backed up overflowing conveyor belt. I asked the female agent to clarify which she wants me to do she tells me to push my items forward. How on an overflowing conveyor belt as you are also yelling at me to go through the metal detector? Her response was a condescending “make it make sense” as if the passengers were too stupid to understand. Atlanta and Miami are always the worse with Atlanta far exceeding Miami. I know it won’t get better because this is how it’s been. I wish TSA would improve its hiring and training.",-1,ATL

Every single restaurant and food place in the F terminal (where I believe all international flights happen) were closed. Every single one. We were gobsmacked. Upon our return home, we had another connection through ATL. Customs line was horrifically long and the security lines to our connecting flight were awful.

My sister has sleep apnoea, to breathe at night, she must carry a CPAP machine. She has asthma, she needs a special inhaler. Her bag was pulled aside not once, nor twice, her bag was detained 'three times'. The TSA agents opened her bag, removed the CPAP machine, and failed to recognize the secondary inhaler machine as another appliance that needed to be scanned separately. Unprofessional and a waste of time. My sister was glared at, accused of being difficult, and treated with such distain and rudeness that her anxiety (for which she is on medication) spiked. Badly. It has been several hours since then, and she is still near tears when she describes her experience. An agent held his hand up in her face to cut her off when she tried to speak to him, and was spoken to both sharply and aggressively when she tried to cooperate. On top of all that, when her bags were thrown in bins to be rescanned, her brand-new neck pillow was jostled loose. Additionally, there was a forgotten black-and-red laptop that sat where it was for over 10 minutes. My sister's medical equipment got scanned three times, but nobody noticed an abandoned device for almost a quarter of an hour? Is this negligence or ignorance? The experience was disgraceful. Unprofessional is too kind a description for the treatment my sister endured.",-1,ATL

If you book a flight at 6, you might as well be prepared to leave at 10 and sit in a chair for hours. I am a frequent flyer here and I have never once had a flight that didn't have a major screw-up or set back. One would assume operating an airport would constitute having functional facilities and airplanes but Atlanta Hartsfield does things differently. I almost never write reviews for anything but Hartsfield has burnt me so many times that I felt like warning anyone curious.

Despite there only being less than a hundred people or so in the queue it took over an hour to get through passport control as there were very few people working. Only one kiosk was going through passengers with special assistance/in wheelchairs and as such there was a queue of over ten people in wheelchairs waiting, I hope none of them became unwell during this time. On our return we were very surprised that in F/international terminal all food outlets closed at 7pm, considering most flights heading East depart later in the evening and at night time this hardly makes a lot of sense.

I have been flying Delta and a skymiles member preferring Delta due to their quality customer service until I had the most rude and disrespectful Delta agent at the luggage check in. She was very impatient barking orders for me to scan my boarding pass and not giving me time to comply before barking another order what's my name she was so impatient. I have severe arthritis and it takes me awhile to use my hands due to stiffness and lost of feeling in my fingers. I handed her my ID as the scanner did not appear to be working. She was sucking her teeth and rolling her eyes it was so uncomfortable dealing with her attitude. I ask could I check my other bag if the flight was full instead of at the gate again due to disability of having to take bags to the gate. She then saw I had my 4 lbs yorkie in her carrier and stated is that an animal. I told her yes she is a dog, I was accused of trying to sneak the dog past her. She would not allow me talk at all. I finally asked for another agent to assist me while she continued to speak to me defensively. Finally another agent come over and took care of me while she continued to fuss in front of him. I asked her please stop speaking to me you are very rude and unprofessional. She threatened to not let me on the flight. I asked why because your being rude I have never had such a poor experience at an airport. I paid the pet fee and thanked the gentleman for helping me. He was very professional. Once I went through security with my pet. The agent that tested my hands was rude and yelled at me because I set my dog down on the counter to prevent from dropping her as he asked for my other hand. Yelled at me to don't put the dog on the counter as if she had rabies. She is a 4lb yorkie. I said sorry please don't yell at me I'm trying not to drop my dog. He was very rough with swabbing my hand and dismissive. I rarely write reviews but I have to let Atlanta know you need to do better. Not coming back through anytime soon. I will also be making complaint to Delta regarding treatment of passengers with disabilities need extra time to preform request.

We spent much of the 4 hours chatting with the ""nice"" lady behind the counter and when it came close to the time we thought we should get a seat assignment to Charleston, she stated she needed to board a flight to PA and then she would get us our seat assignments. She boarded the first flight and then left. Another agent came up and we asked him if we could get the seat assignment and he stated that the gate changed 15 minutes prior. We ran to the gate (which was about 4 up from where we were) and they closed the doors and we ""missed"" the flight. We then needed to find another flight but I was hot. No one was accountable just repeatedly stating that we need to watch the monitors as it was our responsibility. Yes. I 100% agree if I hadn't been in almost constant communication with the lady who stated she would be the one to help. Everyone I talked to was rude and lacked any kind of empathy or accountability. If one more person stated that ""We change gates all the time, you need to watch the monitors"" I thought my head would explode. Whatever happened to common courtesy, or better yet, common sense?

I used to rave about this before, being one of my most favorites in the world. I travel extensively and I always prefer ATL as my port of entry. But I think after the bad experience I had today, I will be looking for another POE. The Immigration had a very long line. But I breezed through that line in less than 10 minutes. Luggage claim and rechecked no problem. After recheck, passengers were about to go through security when we were all redirected to the TSA line upstairs. This was where the mess all started. The lines were very very long, and were hardly moving. There were a few times when the lines just stopped. The smart move would have been to open more metal detectors to get the lines moving, instead the TSA officers were just standing around. They only had three conveyors/detectors opened. Why? This airport was so much better than this. Today was a major disappointment. As a result, I missed my connecting flight to Orlando. And vowed to never fly into this airport again if I could help it.",-1,ATL

It appears that airport leadership is asleep on the job. Airport Parking is typically unavailable, construction seems to be never ending, flow of people inside & outside is mired in chaos, security is inept, food venues are sketchy and to top it all off - the unprofessional customer service attitudes reflects a growing personnel issue that seems to indicate poor training, poor work ethic, and a bizarre entitlement mentality. If you have a choice - find yourself a different airport - even if it means more connections. If leadership is actually reading my very modest review, pleaase turn this airport around and stop its death spiral.",-1,ATL

2021-09-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad,True," Currently holding a temporary residence here at Robins AFB, Georgia. My father drove my car down so that I would have transport to leave base, however, we wanted to fly him back home. I flew in to Atlanta and had just a few issues with my arrival into this airport so I figured it wouldn’t be awful if I booked a flight for my father to fly out of there. I cannot begin to describe how awful the experience was for my dad and I. The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad who is easily confused and older, acted as if he had COVID or was diseased. The TSA agent literally looked as if she was about to draw a weapon on my dad because he was six feet away from her? Additionally the representative at the Delta check-in desk who is posted there to help guests pre-check for their tickets was also so awfully rude. Asked again, another simple question and she acted as if we were burden to ask her anything instead of just letting her stand there and ruin her uneventful day. Normally at my hometown airport, they usually let my dad come into the terminal with me to say goodbye as any day I could get orders to deploy and won’t have a chance to say goodbye before I go. But at this airport, I felt as though they were snatching him away from me and I was afraid he wasn’t going to make his flight because it is an extremely large airport and he is older and just overwhelmed easily. Thankfully and barely, he made it to his gate. He then told me that he was just extremely disappointed because the associates at the counter by the terminal were rude over the intercom every time they used it and just rude to other guests that went up to the counter. It made him so uncomfortable with the entire experience that he never wants to fly out of the airport again and would love it if I never did either. It made him so upset that he ended up crying part of his flight home. He’s concerned that somethings going to happen to me on deployment and he would’ve never gotten to have said goodbye. Simple things like this go a long way for paying customers. Having this experience, I think I will follow my dads advice and fly out from Savannah or another airport the next chance I actually get to fly home.",-1,ATL
2021-09-20,0.8,Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0,,5.0,0.0,,,3.0,be prepared for a long walk and a long wait/standing,False,"  Arrived Atlanta from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Be prepared for a long walk from the gate to Passport Control. The line to have your passport checked was long and took approximately 90 minutes. However, the line moved relatively fast considering there were at least 500 to 1,000 passengers waiting to be processed. I would say it was fairly well organized as they had people directing passengers to the booths. Not a bad experience. Just be prepared for a long walk and a long wait/standing. Here is my major complaint about this airport if you are arriving on an international flight. If your final destination is Atlanta and you wish to catch a ride share, MARTA or a hotel van, passengers are required to ride a small shuttle bus to Ground Transportation which takes 20 minutes. We had two heavy suitcases which had to be lifted into the bus. As we are over 65, it was difficult. Getting passengers from the international terminal to ground transportation in the main terminal is very inefficient and inconvenient.",1,ATL

Quiet is preferable and there is just no reason to blast the concourse with loud, undesirable sound that otherwise causes one to reach for earplugs or noise reduction headsets. Perhaps if the same loud obnoxious noise was pumped into the airport management offices there would be a change. There is no purpose to this noise pollution. Stop the insanity.",1,ATL
2021-08-31,0.2,Business,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Security was a nightmare,False,  We were trying to evacuate Hurricane Ida. We had a group of 40 people. We were finally able to get a bus to take us to Atlanta. With the long traffic we were on the bus for 14 hours with no sleep. Arrived 4am to the airport. Security was a nightmare. Not because it was backed up but mostly because it was very confusing. Especially on 20 hours with no sleep. The woman at the security area where we were putting our things on the conveyor was literally screaming at me. I was confused and tired as she continued to scream and belittle me. Had she just explained calmly I would have understood what she was saying. Once I got through my feet were filthy with dirt and crud all over the floor. I had 3 elderly people in our group in wheelchairs. 2 of them were helped to the gate by employees. We still had one with us. Getting on the Tram was tricky. The Tram throws you around so badly that we were trying to hold the chair and ourselves. A lady had her baby trying to get her in a stroller. The baby didn't want in the stroller so she was trying to hold her and the stroller as it was rolling around. I grabbed the stroller as she tried to hold on to the baby. We found our gate around 6 am. There are many restaurants in the airport but none of them open. Once a Dunkin Donuts opened the line was all the way down the corridor.,-1,ATL

2021-08-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,4.0,this is one of the worst I’ve come across,True," For a large airport, this is one of the worst I’ve come across. The gates are filthy, the information is lacking, and the online resources are lacking. We had a four hour layover so had plenty of time to find amenities, but had to search for a map or info. The one bright spot was a meal at One Flew South, a unique menu well prepared, but we barely got there before their kitchen closed at 6.30 pm. The public WiFi is pathetic. While writing this review, sitting in terminal D, I have had to reconnect a half-dozen times. And there are no visible charging stations. Another problem here is the attitude of public who are evidently, we were told, protesting having to wear masks in the airport. Can’t tell you how many people — including flight crew members — we saw walking the terminals with their masks under their noses or completely off. This may be something common in the area, but since mask wearing is a requirement of all airports — and other airports have signage about how to wear a mask — it would seem there is something Atlanta Hartsfield could make a better effort to keep their passengers safe.

2021-07-26,0.4,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,,2.0,0.0,,,,This airport is badly designed,True," This is probably the worst airport I have been through. And I once worked at JFK with its many terminals. I had to transit through this airport from Costa Rica to catch a domestic flight to JFK NYC. There are no restrooms in the immediate area. The plane I came off had one aisle. And the flight attendants spent a good deal of time using the aisle to serve snacks. So it's not always convenient to use the restroom on the aircraft. Common sense you would think they would place restrooms near where the gate is where we got off the plane. Then it's not like you can just walk to the CBP area. We had to stand there for as much as 15 minutes and more at least twice before being allowed to proceed to the long line to present our passports. Walking from the gate to the CBP seems like 1/4 of a mile. There were hundreds of people on the line. There is a restroom in that area but with such a long line and a connecting flight less than two hours of my arrival I did not want to chance using it then getting on line. The saving grace was that the customs officer did not take long with my passport. He basically looked at my photo, asked me to remove my mask then asked me if I am who it says I am. Then I was on my way. It took over one hour to exit the CBP line. Someone took my luggage and put it on the belt to be sent to my JFK NYC flight. As soon as we walked out of that area we all had to go through security as if we had just walked off the street. I overheard one of the TSA agents telling someone that until you reach age 75 you have to remove your shoes. Well around where I live I see people who could barely get on the bus without the driver lowering the stairs. And many of these people are not even 50 years old. After going through security I checked the board but could not find my flight listed. I asked a lady at information desk. She told me I had to take the shuttle train on the right hand side one stop to area E. And go to E11. I went to E11. No such flight. I went to the Delta counter I saw when I came to area E. The lady told me I had to go to E 31 and the flight is about to leave so I had to hurry. I was the last person to get on the plane when I heard them say they were about to close the door. A gate agent came with me. She said there was no more room for my carry-on so I had to check it but not before I removed my laptop and camera which most likely would be stolen. My advice is avoid this airport if you're connecting from an international flight. Connecting domestic to international was not an issue when I was leaving. Unless you got four hours between international arrival and your departure connection don't risk it. And putting a restroom all the way in the customs area serves no purpose because most people need to use the restroom as soon as they exit the plane. This airport is badly designed. When I was leaving for Costa Rica I arrived after 8 am on a weekday morning and none of the restaurants were open. Not even a place to serve coffee. It's as if the airport was designed for the convenience of airport staff and not its passengers!",-1,ATL

The few places that were open had line 30-40 people deep. At 10.40 am there was a place that made breakfast wraps but they weren’t open until 11.00 am?? But yet there was a pizza place that was open.

I have no idea what the others did. They were told a shuttle would come again in a half hour. The Atlanta Airport is a mess.

On my return trips I typically arrive around 6.30 to 6.45 pm. Almost all restaurants are closed. It's the strangest thing. This is not an occasional situation. It's every evening visit. Who is managing this airport? Why is this the case? After talking to employees at the information center, I've found out the restaurants close at 4:00 +/-. Now there's a couple of the larger restaurants open like TGI Fridays open, but most people w/ connectors don't have that much time. Currently, I'm in E terminal and there are 8 restaurants in the food court and only 1 is open [McDonald's]. Now there like a 100 people in line so that's not an option. All but (2) of the he convenience stores are closed and those have huge lines. The restaurant services should be for the peoples convenience and not the restaurant's convenience. Why hasn't the management observed this and made adjustments? I don't think they should stay open all night, but this is a little ridiculous. I'm sure they will blame this on COVID, but this has been going on long before COVID (I've been traveling through here for years). My guess it has a little to do with the controlling power of the political power of the mayor and her cronies.",-1,ATL

I have flown into countless airports domestically and internationally and never had such an awful experience. I absolutely will never fly into or out of this airport again and I strongly suggest that no one else does either. I will gladly pay more money to fly in and out of a smaller airport.

Then after going through the gauntlet of passport control then I stepped in a room of mass hysteria to get my luggage, then drop it off. Then I was directed to go upstairs to check in for my connecting flight, only to be told they don’t have TSA precheck. After going through the security check then I had to go back downstairs to catch a train to go to my terminal which was filthy.

So - the many outlets placed under the seats are rendered useless. C’mon Atlanta. We travelers don’t ask for much. A couple of food options, a place to sit, and a place to recharge our phones. It’s how we use our time - by doing work on our laptops, staying in touch with loved ones as we travel, and entertaining ourselves with what for many is a few moments to ourselves. We even bring our own equipment - we just need access to outlets. I think we pay a tax to travel through - right? Please fix this big oversight.

I sat and watched an employee approach Gate D3 where there were restless travelers who looked to be exhausted. The employee sat directly behind them and commenced on playing loud videos that included abrasive language and music. I was totally shocked! Shortly thereafter, another employee with a ABM uniform (Who had just finished cleaning the DS4-2-E1) Women's Bathroom who worked for housekeeping found her way over with a bag of chips and a sprite to have a lengthy conversation on her cellphone on loud speaker. After she got off the phone she had the audacity to burp out loud! Disgusting! Low and behold as I look up and ahead there is another employee with a PrimeFlight uniform on pushing a empty wheelchair eating yet another bag of snacks! All of this activity took place between 9am and 10am. This behavior is unprofessional. No wonder people look at us as ignorant unprofessional selfish individuals. I am sometimes ashamed of my own people.",-1,ATL

I traveled today and in perfect ATL form I had the absolute misfortune of dealing with the rudest person at the security check point. I’d like to tell you this is the first time, but it’s not. Why are these airport workers so disgustingly rude? Why is everyone ok with this? There are plenty of other busy airports that have respectful employees. When travel has declined so much due to COVID can you all really afford to allow this behavior? These employees take advantage of travelers just because! I’m sure this review, like the others, will fall on deaf ears, just look at all your current reviews-shameful!",-1,ATL

I left food in my suitcase in error and what they put me through was horrible. The screaming in your face during Covid, lack of social distancing at all. The women TSA agents were the worst. The level they got to in their voices and body movements was terrifying and abusive. Terrible airport to say the least. The TSA needs to be investigated for abuse of power.",-1,ATL
2020-11-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,no one is policing the masks requirements!,False,"  Atlanta needs people to feel safe and fly to bring revenue to the city and airport. We will not be flying because no one is policing the masks requirements! Airlines can only police in their aircrafts. I saw several w/o masks in the train and many more at the boarding gate. They would sit with their backs to the gate agents (who do not have any power, except on their planes)! I saw many of the gate cargo workers from DGS at the food court, with no masks sitting talking on their phones. The Chiropractor on concourse A didn't even have a mask on and when I asked her where was her mask, she cut me a look! So many people, if they had a mask, had it below their nose. Atlanta Hartsfield has failed again. We will not be flying any more. A sign on the entrance door requiring a mask is not working.",-1,ATL

My husband and I decided to grab lunch from Subway in terminal T today while waiting for our plane to board. The two ladies working behind the counter (both making our sandwiches as well as the cashier) were unbelievably rude. We could have purchased our lunches from another establishment, but decided on Subway. These ladies weren’t doing us any favors, they acted as if we were bothering them. Excuse me! Never again will I purchase anything from this establishment while traveling through the Atlanta airport. In addition, almost all the employees at this airport are rude! If you do not like your job then quit! Nobody is paying for my travels nor is it free. At the very least, be courteous. If we weren’t traveling you wouldn’t even have the option to have your job. All flights staff have been kind and courteous, if only the employees in the airport would follow their lead.",-1,ATL

My parents speak limited English, however written instructions as well as verbal information was given but everyone they came in contact with in reference to getting from the international terminal to domestic were rude. They actually came on a repatriation Flight due to a lockdown in India because of covid-19 through the US government and this airport was the only place it ended from Mumbai. I was hoping to avoid this airport for them but due to the circumstances I couldn’t. Sadly, even our beloved Southwest Airlines counter agent who was checking them into their Chicago flight was not nice to them. My exhausted parents eventually made it to Chicago but unfortunately I was compelled to write an honest review of their experience. I hope that during training or pep talks everyone is reminded that kindness doesn’t cost anything. Hopefully if we learn anything from this pandemic it’ll be compassion.",-1,ATL

First, it started just before South terminal baggage claim by doors S3, winds along the right side of the hall to the south terminal then crosses the hall and winds back up the left side to the entry door of Clear. Then the shared hall with regular TSA Lines. Looks like at least one of the Clear machines is broken. But the TSA lines and regular Clear lines look to be as long or longer. What gives? I almost wonder if general boarding is shorter. It took us over 35 minutes and the line is much much longer now than it was 30 minutes ago.",-1,ATL

Making me now have to leave security. It is my right to have a place too. The non-smokers and health conscience individuals I am by no means stating you have to be around my smoke just like I don't want to drink your juice or eat your vegetable burger. I, as a conscientious smoker, try to remember that everyone has a right but now you are removing my right as an American to enjoy what I enjoy. I will never fly through ATL and will advise any other smokers to avoid it like the plague since we don't matter either now. I would give this airport a minus number but they are biased against that as well.",-1,ATL

That was the entire reason I always chose this airport! I will not do so anymore! What is the point of removing the smoking rooms? It’s not going to help or make anyone quit smoking - it’s only going to increase the number of angry passengers. Before at least you could chill out with a smoke before your flight and/or get a smoke in between flights - helped with the mental stress of flying! Not having that break in between made my travel day horrible! And the rooms were not bothering non-smoking people nor polluting the air around them - non-smokers never had to go anywhere in those rooms if they didn’t want to so that would not be a good reason to remove them either! I really don’t understand it. I won’t be returning to Atlanta airport.,-1,ATL

We had a 5 hour layover, which is approximately 5 and half hours longer than I would like in hindsight. The rudeness of everyone who works here is unreal. Being my first time in Atlanta, and the South being renowned for genteel manners and politeness I put on my best manners and did my very best not to be just another horrid Yankee. Workers were rude to me, my wife, my 9 year old ... I think they would've verbally abused my luggage if I wasn't in transit.",-1,ATL
2020-01-18,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,Every experience at this airport is miserable,False,"  
I travel about once a month. Most of my destinations are flying through Atlanta airport. Every single time I've encountered the most extreme rude behavior from staff at this airport. Delta customer service in Atlanta - horribly rude. Fast food workers on the tram - rude, discussing buying guns at obnoxious loudness, laying feet up so disabled and elderly can't sit down, etc.. This time I was in Savannah's candy kitchen and a girl came out from the back room and ran directly into me because apparently I was in her way of trying to leave work. I was standing in line trying to buy something. Every experience at this airport is miserable. I'll take the longer way next time.",-1,ATL
2020-01-17,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,airport outgrew itself a while ago,True," That airport outgrew itself a while ago and it is a mess. I sometime feel less cramped at New York Grand Central at Peak hours. Among the worst is going through security! There was a failed attempt to innovate screening with the worst luggage pre-scan staging invented by a 3-year old that obviously did not have any idea what he was doing. Then there is the useless Clear which ends up being slower than regular TSA-Pre most of the time. Finally there is that weird attempt to reduce TSA-Pre load by randomly picking people in the line to give them a privileged queue which is annoying everybody else that will be left in there for another 10 or 15 mins. After Security there is really nothing to make you forget the bad start, it is an average or bad experience at best, specifically if you want to sit quietly and even worse if you think about working.",-1,ATL

I am a wheelchair user, and got treated very well going through Atlanta. There was a priority line at passport control for disabled people. People at security were polite and considerate. The young man assigned to push my wheelchair was lovely. Food was mostly good. Concourse D had a good selection. I had a horrible experience at Dulles (Washington, DC) spring 2019, and found Atlanta to be just the opposite.",1,ATL

Other passengers were letting us go in front of them but we had no chance, it was impossible. All they had to do was let us go to the front of the line, what was even more frustrating was we had to catch a cruise ship the next day. Immigration say sort it out with your airline, absolutely disgusting I would avoid this airport never have I come across so bad manners. No customer Service at all.",-1,ATL
2020-01-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,,5.0,3.0,,,1.0,doesn't give a very good impression,False," Passed through Atlanta each way on a 12-day trip to Belize. On each occasion, the immigration queues were well over 1 hour, and on the return trip after 1hr 20 mins, I had to ask people if I could jump the queue as I was in danger of missing my connecting flight to the UK. At least half the booths were unused. Asked a member of staff if she could help but she just said: ""you'll just have to wait in line"". I thanked her for her help. Perhaps they weren't expecting a large number of people arriving all at once? Is this an example of American efficiency? It doesn't give a very good impression to anyone travelling through!",-1,ATL

When trying to find TSA Precheck, representatives refused to answer a question and over talked me not allowing me to show them I was TSA precheck therefore not needing general boarding. I don’t understand what has happened to customer service in Atlanta Airport. Please check your workers. If they would get off their phones and stop having personal conversations with each other and smile and assist customers it would make all the difference.",-1,ATL

2019-11-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,a huge queue and very few staff on duty,True," We had to connect through Atlanta on a flight from London Heathrow to Orlando. We had enough time for the connection and as the plane landed slightly early there should have been no problem. When we got to Passport and Immigration control there was a huge queue and very few staff on duty. We waited well over an hour in this line before we were allowed to go through. Then to our horror we found that we had to go through security again even though we had been through security at Heathrow and had not left the airport. Going through the channel for connecting flights should have made things easier but the staff seemed to not be aware or didn’t care that people had other flights to get to. The security channel was chaos - there was no proper line, it was totally disorganised and the staff were surly and unhelpful. Lots of people were in danger of missing their flights but they just didn’t care! They seemed to take pleasure in working as slowly as they could. We had to run to our departure gate but it had been closed and even though it hadn’t left we couldn’t board. We weren’t the only people to miss that flight and we met lots of people who had also missed their connections because of this incompetence. As we couldn’t get another flight till the next day we had to pay for overnight accommodation. I would never travel through this dreadful airport again.",-1,ATL

The employees at ATL airport especially TSA are so rude and disrespectful and need to be retrained in customer service and social skills. The reps are calling people stupid and actually using that term. After literally being screamed at I had to interject when a rep screamed at my daughter. I refuse to allow anyone to disrespect me and my family, this is the second time I had to fly out of this airport and will be the last. She and her colleagues upset me so much, I believe they use their positions to be very controlling. It was a total embarrassment but I’m not a child and will not be treated like one. After going off on the TSA rep telling her she don’t have to talk to people in that way She advised me “if I didn’t like the way it was, to go elsewhere, and let her move before she got snappy”. I wish I would have gotten all their names.",-1,ATL

What happens if someone misses their connecting flight? Will they just say “too bad?”. Terrible airport — moving forward, we will make sure never to have a connecting stop here!",-1,ATL

After my mom and I got off our flight, we proceeded to the exit and asked the gentleman if he could help give us directions to the gate of our next flight. He looked up and I quote, ""Look at the T.V. screen. I don't know about that."" I don't know if he was just being lazy or if he really did know his job. Anyway, I walk away and overhear some of the other passengers talking about the same flight so I followed them. Still doubting myself, I ask three other Atlanta Airport employees and they all said the same thing; that they had no clue to that too. At last, I finally had enough of the same answer; knowing that my boarding time was closing in, I asked a pilot if he could help me for a second and he did. I feel terrible that I didn't even catch his name, but I am so thankful that he was able to spare a second to help. Again, I hope that Atlanta's Airport works on their customer service.",-1,ATL

A recurring problem is understaffing at TSA lanes when the airport admin clearly knows how many passengers will be traveling at any given time. Today TSA decided to run a canine check in the middle of the busiest Monday morning rush hour leading to lines way down the hall and shutting down all priority lanes. First time I have missed a flight in over 30 years and I travel weekly. I explained to airport staff directing people that my flight wears boarding as time passed. Nothing they could do. Except they would take others randomly who were rushing and brought them to the front of the line. Big disruption in one day emergency trip.,-1,ATL

Staff members all over the airport - in the terminals, the shuttle, the gates, were all cursing and obnoxious. At 2am, a guy at gate D2 was opening one of the stores, and blasting hip hop music. This is at a gate where our flights had been delayed by hours on end, everyone is cranky and sleepy, and this dude blasting music without a care in the world.

Every single person working there was very rude. Even the airport police. I have never been treated so bad in my life. The officer literally screamed at me for not hearing him. I am a senior with a hearing disability and I am not a criminal. I also do not appreciate to be yelled at. He upset me so much. They made us late and we missed our flight out. They have zero social skills. They need to be retrained. I believe they use their positions to be very controlling. I will never fly through that airport again. First time I ever have and will never return. All the staff were rude, but this officer about had me in tears. It was a total embarrassment and I’m not a child, and will not be treated like one. The money exchange lady, had no name tag and she was also very rude. She told me if I didn’t like the way it was, to go elsewhere. All I did was clarify a question. I wouldnt doubt she ripped me off. Horrible people there. I will spread the word around my neck of the woods to ‘Don’t travel through Atlanta’ if at all possible. The bathrooms were least desirable as well.",-1,ATL
2019-07-16,0.2,Family Leisure,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,staff in Atlanta airport are rude,True,"  Delta seating was spacious and clean, onboard staff were friendly and attentive, complimentary snacks and beverages, and the flight was on time.  I paid $1057 for myself and 2 kids to fly one way for a total duration of 1.5 hrs. This airline promised free WiFi but the WiFi doesn’t work. The ground agents/staff working in the Atlanta airport are rude. When checking my bag in, the rep looked at me as if I was bothering her. She never greeted me with hello or a smile. I was clearly confused as the Atlanta airport is 5x the size of my hometown airport and even said out loud, “I don’t know where to go”. She just ignored me and looked away. I eventually figured it out but it would’ve been extremely helpful if she just pointed or simply said that way. I’m sorry but if I’m paying Delta over 1k to fly I’d at least like to receive decent customer service. I think Delta should invest in customer service training.

2019-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,employees are incompetent,True," 9 of us were supposed to fly out of the Hartfield Jackson airport to go to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic for a family vacation. We were supposed to travel by Swift Air, a small charter company. Atlanta Airport is huge and all of us were at the airport international terminal 3.5 hours before our flight. We have looked around for Swift Air signs but did not see any, so we asked 3 different airport customer service representatives, showed them our travel documents, and all of them told us that we have to go to the Domestic terminal, even though it was an international flight. We also stopped by the information desk at the international terminal, showed our paperwork, the customer service representative checked something on her computer and also advised us to go to the domestic terminal. It takes at least 20 min to get to the Domestic terminal plus the waiting time for the shuttle. Once we got there and run around through the whole terminal, asked several staff members, who had no idea where Swift Air was, we finally got to one of the TSA members who used his radio to find out that Swift is at the International terminal. After we spend $50 on the taxi for 20 min drive, since we were running out of time, we got back to where we started. We ran through the whole terminal and finally found Swift Air counters all the way in the back of the terminal with no signs in the whole airport to guide people where to go, except for the signs on top of the counter. Also, all of the international terminal staff members had no clue where Swift Air counters were! We got to the counter 45 minutes before the flight, but we were denied boarding, as well as another family of 5, who went through the same ordeal. I do not understand why airport employees are incompetent and not knowledgeable. No one knows which airline is located at what terminal. Due to all of this, we had to purchase new tickets from Birmingham, AL with a connection back in Atlanta, for the next morning. We had to rent 2 cars, drive 3 hours to AL, fly back to Atlanta to finally board to Punta Cana, all due to the incompetency of staff working at the airport.

Today I had a few hours between my connecting flights so I stopped through the E concourse food court area to grab a bite. I purchased food from Nature’s Table Bistro. I sat down, ate, made some calls and about an hour later, I started to make my way over to my next gate. I had quite a bit of food still left on my plate since I got full very fast; but don’t like traveling with unnecessary baggage. When I went to throw away my plate, a man was changing out the trash bags. When I handed him my plate, he opened the lid and very rudely told me how wasteful I was and that I shouldn’t be throwing away fresh food. When I walked away, I could hear him talking about me to his coworker and he continued to shake his head at me. I was irritated because I purchased the food with my own money and I’m not obligated to defend the amount that I choose not to eat. Every time I fly through ATL, I prepare myself for this kind of treatment because it happens more often than not. I only wish there was someone I could talk to directly about him. His behavior was unacceptable.",-1,ATL

The check in (admittedly not the airports fault) took over half an hour at the front of the line to check in for business class. Someone checking in 16 bags in the first class line but not flying first or business. Then endless queues for passport checks and photos and an inordinately long wait for luggage checks with queues snaking round the block and just two screeners. Took over an hour to go from check in to the departure lounge. No one smiled or apologised. Then the lounge was like a zoo. Nowhere to sit and sandwiches with the bread curled up and hard. I had asked for help with lifting my bags even through I’m only three weeks post op with a large bandage and dressing on my neck. I would do my best to avoid in future.,-1,ATL

We departed the plane, entered the airport and the janitorial cleaning crew had all the men restrooms blocked off as if they were cleaning them, but what's strange is they were standing in front of the ropes off area preventing entrance or use of the restroom.

",True," I was unfortunate enough to have to attend a meeting in Atlanta, unfortunate not because of Atlanta but because I had to pass through this airport. The layout is just crazy with incredibly long terminals so be sure to where your walking shoes. TSA is a nightmare as all passengers for all airlines pass through a central checkpoint which is so incredibly slow, the slowest service I have ever encountered (including Orlando which at least spilts to two terminal wings) and I’ve been through a number of airports. Even the TSA Pre line had about a half hour plus wait. The airport itself looks old although clean and seems to lack some of the new tech like charging stations for devices that you would expect to find in this day and age. I flew JetBlue out of JFK for this trip and what a difference between JetBlues own terminal 5 and this hole in the wall. If you can avoid passing through this airport I highly recommend it as many of the people don’t really seem to care about the travelers passing through and if you have a connecting flight that’s either at a distant gate or concourse you may miss your flight as they are so far away. There are no terminal shuttle carts like you would find in other big airports like Dallas or Raleigh Durham.",-1,ATL

Considering that I have traveled to over 50 countries and all over the United States, that says a lot. I have been in and out of Atlanta at least 10 times in the last six months. I have TSA Pre and Clear and still I meet mass confusion when I’m checking in. This airport is a busy airport for business people, so there are lots of early flights. Maybe TSA doesn’t know that because there’s always one end of security that’s closed. Picking someone up from here isn’t any easier. Departures are both up and downstairs and the signs are last minute so you may miss it. Of course there’s major construction going on so when you miss it will take a while to get back around.

On arrival at 5:15 pm the terminal was crowded already and there was no movement in the line at all for about 30 minutes, there didn't seem to be any officials working at all but could not verify this because of size of crowd. Line moved very slowly and as planes kept arriving crowd grew. Personnel controlling crowd did not offer clear guidance and could not be heard. I cleared Customs at 7:15, 2 hours later. then TSA had to be cleared - take off shoes, etc, pick up luggage and reroute, then a mad dash to connecting flight.

We could not get a flight out until the following morning, had to get a hotel room and lost work time on Monday. This experience was an unbelievable embarrassment to the US. We have traveled out of the country many times and have never experienced such a lack of service, caring and unprofessionalism. From the other reviews here it is evident that this is commonplace in Atlanta. When given a choice we will not come through Atlanta again. Atlanta airport and US Customs displayed a very unfriendly and disappointing reflection on our country.

The lines went back and forth around the agents desks and then went down 4 or 5 more hallways. Literally everyone around us missed their connecting flights, including us. Staff were miserable and rude and didn’t care one bit or try to help in any way. One giggled when I told her that we had been in line for 1.5hr so far and only had 20 minutes before our plane was taking off. Her exact words were “well you are going to miss” and she walked away.

Staff did not seem knowledgeable in any way. They snatched tickets from peoples hands, they did not make eye contact and were rude all the way through the process. One particular security lady was a perfect example of how rude this airport's staff is. Without provocation she starts getting at me about the smallest things and being condensing beyond what I have ever experienced in my life and continued to verbally abuse me until I went through the scanner.

We arrived in Atlanta to go thru passport/immigration control. There are about 20 passport scanners but only two were being utilized. Everyone had to go thru extremely long lines to get to a counter with a person, of which there were maybe 7, with hundreds of people in line. Employees shouting at us to go in this direction only to have another employee say the opposite when we get there. Bickering between airport employees, no clear signs about where to go. Not sure I understand the need to go thru airport security again after an international flight. This was the worst run airport for passport control I have ever seen. It was embarrassing for the US, especially when traveling overseas and see how European airports are managed. This can be so much better but no one seems to care unless they are the ones that have to go thru it. I will try to avoid the Atlanta airport when I am traveling international.

We arrived from St. Maarten, 3/24/19 at 7pm. It took 15-20 minutes to go through Global Entry. There were 10 kiosks and 2 were operational. People were using the kiosk that did not have GE, tying up the line and being rejected. Since we had a long lay over we waited for our family members to pick up their bags. It took them 2 hours and 15 minutes to get through customs.

First, it took us 2 hours to get through customs and the kiosks were all working but we still had to go to a desk. Once we finally got through customs, our flight had been delayed due to weather which is understandable but then once we finally boarded the plane we are sitting here for almost an hour just for the captain to announce that the airport has lost some people’s bags.

As US citizens we spent about 4 hrs standing in a line just go through immigration. Such a disgrace for such a big airport!

I had a 3 hour layover and I’m about to miss my connecting flight because this airport is inadequately staffed.

2019-02-23,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,the worst airport in the US,True," Atlanta airport is without a doubt the worst airport in the US. I travel every week for work and have flown into dozens of US airports in the last 10 years, so I say this with a great deal of travel experience. The security lines are always long, even the TSA pre-check lines I use are long. In fact, these are often longer than the normal security lines at other major airports. They’ve also made a change so there’s only one entry into TSA pre-check so it’s quite a haul for most passengers coming into the terminal on ‘the wrong side.’ Again, no other major airport in the US has this major inconvenience like ATL. Also, the facility is not in the greatest shape for such a prominent airport, and I seem to encounter a lot more rude people there between security line herders and unfriendly airline staff; attitudes abound. I don’t know what’s in the water in Atlanta, but I think the ATL Airport Authority and airline management would be well served to get out of their office and walk around the terminals more and see the experience us travelers are having in their airport. While I love the city of Atlanta, I dread having to travel there for business every time due to the very negative aspects of the airport experience.",-1,ATL

Had wheelchair requested because I can’t walk fast enough to get from point A to point B on time because of knee and hip issues. There was no chair at the plane, so I began to walk. The first person I came to was at immigration. I ask about a chair and her reply was that I should have stayed at the plane. She ask another “worker” but while they stood there telling me it was my fault, I continued on because at immigration we had to stand in line on one side of the building to be able to then let go in groups to stand in line on the other side. I ask immigration officer if he knew who I could ask about it. He said Delta desk. Ask another man on the way to baggage claim. He said down stairs. Ask a young man down stairs, he said down hall on right. Never saw a desk. Checked bag again, then ask a Delta employee, who ask another ”worker” if she had a radio. No response! Went through security and ask what gate our flight left from because it wasn’t on ticket. Had to go back upstairs to E5. When we got back upstairs saw a young man in a golf cart who ask if we needed a ride to our gate. Was so thankful for this offer, I could have cried! It wasn’t that much farther but I could hardly put one foot in front of the other. This is the first time I have ever ask for a chair and not got it but it was very inconvenient and painful. Your job to have chair at plane when it’s clearly on boarding pass. Your attention please, so it doesn’t happen again.

There were no signs or anything, I just wanted to make sure to go in the right direction. Please get rid of employees like this, hire decent and nice people. This airport has been the worst experience with customer service, after traveling from an airport in a country where quality of life is less than in the US and you get to the US and there is a huge difference in how people treat you.

Can you fix stupid? I hope so. Dropping off and picking up passengers is, to repeat myself, stupid. Flown into KATL many times over the decades but today was my first time trying to drop off a passenger. I’ve performed this task all over the country, at airports large and small; I expected one of the busiest airports (in the world) to be, well, organised. To some degree.

We almost missed our flight with 1hr and 42 minutes between flights, all spent in one very poorly organized and understaffed immigration area. We usually fly into JFK on flights from Europe so we are very familiar with the procedure but I have never seen such a poor arrangement as the one in Atlanta. We were returning from Guadeloupe to Newark via Atlanta on a Saturday evening and joined approximately 800 others arriving from So. America and the Caribbean who were 90% returning American citizens. We were funneled into a huge room full of crazy 8 lines and zig zags of lined up people being directed by airport attendants who tried to be helpful but it was pretty hard to help with directions. And there were only about 8 of them and maybe 10 immigration officers. There would have been triple that number at JFK. The airport personnel tried to help expedite the kiosks (which don't generally help because no one really gets what you're supposed to do - the cards were easier!) in our case these people were quite helpful, but you had to wait in line for every step. It took us a full 1hr 30 min. to get through that, many of us figuring we were never going to make our next flights. An airport employee did look up our gate for us. Of course it was at the literal other end of the terminal (from Term F to A). Then we had to get our bags (6 carousels with 4 flights on each one....!) and get them to the next point where the baggage handlers were actually very efficient and pleasant despite the total chaos. They seemed used to it. Then security again which because of the throngs of people (we had already been through it anyway), they just sort of let us pass by except for a few poor souls who had to have their things inspected. They need many more immigration officers working at that airport and it would have been very embarrassing to witness that scene with foreign nationals trying to navigate it.

This was not our first time having to go through customs. As we arrived at customs, the line was huge. We were sent down a hallway, where we waited in a line that zig zagged forever. Once we reached the area where we would choose which section to go (U.S. citizens, foreign visitors, mobile passport), we went into the mobile passport line. After waiting in the line for about fifteen minutes we realized we were waiting in the wrong line. That line was for foreign visitors. So we went back and asked again and she told us we were in the wrong line. We finally were in the right line after waiting already about two hours in line for customs so far. All of our flights were departing soon so we needed to get through customs and security quickly. As we approached the stand for mobile passport, the woman who was working rudely asked us if we were a family living in the same household. We replied no, and then took one family at a time. She was the most unpleasant agent I have ever encountered. She was miserable. She was not respectful at all! I understand that she deals with a lot of people during the day but that is no reason for her to be miserable and rude to people entering the country. It is so embarrassing to think about people coming to the United States for the first time. The first they encounter is horribly long lines for customs and then rude employees. At the point in customs I was so embarrassed to be an American. I have traveled through the Atlanta airport many times and every time it is more and more disappointing. Such a disappointing experience. I will now avoid traveling through the Atlanta airport. We all almost missed our flights. After customs the security was so disorganized. The employees didn’t seem to know anything or know what the heck they were supposed to be doing. Horrible experience in the Atlanta airport.",-1,ATL
2018-08-24,0.7,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,generally find little to complain about,True," I travel through Atlanta Airport several times a year, and generally find little to complain about considering the size of it together with the vast amount of travelers that travel through it. I also realize that my complaint is not necessarily due to the airport authorities but rather to Border & Customs Control. With the recent additions of passport kiosks where the traveler enters their passport and customs declaration, I thought that would speed up the process of entering the country from abroad, but this is not the case. We still have to present our credentials to be inspected by a decreasing number of officers. This has increased the entry time drastically. As a US citizen, having to wait for 2-1/2 hours in line to be seen by an Immigration officer is beyond belief.",1,ATL

First, there is only a single checkpoint for 8 terminals. Second, the lines for SWA Flyby and other priority board are barely marked or nonexistent. Then the security scan allows people from behind you in line to move past you and push their bags through such that there is an inevitable backlog wherein the people who have already put their belongings in bins are waiting to push those bins through and people who have already gone through body scan are waiting for their luggage, instead of making any attempt whatsoever to keep luggage with owners during the process. Only the trains run with any respectable efficiency to reduce the trek from rental car drop-off to gate to a mere mile. Nearly 2 hours from car to gate is unacceptable for such a central airport. I will avoid flying through here at all costs in the future. Also, unable to get on the wi-fi.",-1,ATL

Their bin system when you are about to send your luggage through at security is confusing and frankly stupid. The TSA employees don’t communicate professionally in any way. They don’t make eye contact and answer questions rudely like an insubordinate child would. Why are people with such poor communication skills being hired?

",False,"  Typically I don't write reviews for poor service because I believe that most people don't write them for good service either. However, the customer service at Atlanta-Hartsfield airport has been consistently very rude and condescending. It's become so common place that I don't even want to choose Delta anymore to avoid going through Atlanta. Almost every employee has an attitude and you can tell they think it's funny to be rude. I went to the food court to get a slice of pizza and am greeted with, ""what u want?"". When I politely said, ""I'm sorry"", the employee repeated herself. I proceeded to be nice and smiled throughout my experience only to be met with mumbling, no eye contact and laughter among the employees. It's not just the food service employees. I witnessed an older gentleman who was an airport employee ask another young employee for help with an elderly passenger. The young employee responded with some verbal disgust and then she proceeded to roughly handle the elderly passenger in a wheelchair. I really think the airport should focus on customer service relations and training. Every experience I've had there has involved a minimum of one, and usually more than one rude employees. Please be advised that I'm not talking about any TSA employee. They have a tough job and aren't part of this conversation. I would have airport management take off their uniform and interact with the airport employees. It won't take them long to see what myself and many others are telling them. Quite frankly, I'm extremely embarrassed the customer service at Atlanta-Hartsfield is what many foreign travelers base their opinion of Americans and our hospitality on.",-1,ATL
2018-06-23,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,my least favorite airport,True," Airport Authority severely punishes ride-share (Uber/Lyft) users. This is truly my least favorite airport in the US. Part of it is the fact that as I fly out of the DFW airport most of the time, I am usually on American Airlines and their gates at the Atlanta airport are about a mile from any ground transportation area. I have suffered that indignity in silence for several years, however I finally was tipped over the edge this latest trip when I dared to use Uber/Lyft at the airport. The airport authority clearly has a strong distaste for ride share companies and is doing all they can to frustrate travelers from using them. After walking a mile from the gate to the ground transportation area, I had to ask 3 individuals how to get to the ride share area before I found the down escalator nestled among the baggage carousels that took me to the correct exit. Upon finding the exit, it was another mile walk outside in the Atlanta heat to the designated ride share pickup area. At that point, as the ride share app would not let me choose a location for pickup until I was there, I had to wait another 10 minutes for the Lyft driver to come from their designated wait area. The drivers for the ride shares are also confused about where to pull in to pick up passengers and there was often traffic bottlenecks as folks loaded up. There were also about 100 riders waiting in the pickup area and this was at 8.30pm on a Monday night. The ordeal added at least 30 minutes to my arrival time and left me hot and angry. Let me repeat, the Atlanta airport sucks.",-1,ATL

They changed the locations of the TSA Pre-Check and when I asked an employee where to go, I was snapped at. I heard a TSA worker mumble something at a man that asked her a legitimate question and when he asked her ""pardon?"" she replied ""Don't yell at me sir!"". Since I had TSA pre-check I assumed that we did not need to remove shoes, laptops, etc. so I did not. The agent at the Checkpoint basically ""goated"" me into a response when she got nasty with me about leaving my iPad in my carry on. She removed it and just started ""bouncing & slamming"" it through the x-ray. They basically opened up my carry on and took items out randomly and re-ran them through x-ray. (I figured if you want to see my dirty underwear - that's your prerogative!) However, I did not say a word because I cannot afford to end up on a no-fly list. I was then herded through the scanner. I felt sorry for a poor elderly lady in front of me. She was in a wheelchair and they were trying to make her walk through the x-ray. She clearly could not walk - no mercy or kindness from the TSA agents. (Like this 80+ year old woman was a security risk!). I am very disappointed in Atlanta TSA - actually I'm still very angry at the rudeness they showed. But the thing that angers me the most is that these TSA agents can act/speak to you any way they want - but when you try to speak back to them in the same tone, you are the one that suffers.

Today, the security checkpoint pulled numerous bags out to search in a row, including mine. When she said I couldn’t have an aerosol with me (holding a hair product that I’ve flown with several times), I calmly said “oh that isn’t a liquid or aerosol” and she responded “oh well it’s in the trash” and threw it away.

After clearing customs and security, we had to move quickly and arrived at our gate for the next flight as they were boarding Zone 2. We had nothing to declare, there weren't any issues with us, the problem is the lack of adequate working staff for the volume of people attempting to clear customs. Everyone around us was frantic about potentially missing their connections and there is no recourse because as were told by the airport employees ""everyone here has a connecting flight"". We have no intention of ever taking another international flight that requires us to go through customs in Atlanta.

The directional signs were prominent and plentiful and I took the shuttle train that connects the terminals - no wait for it at all. All the terminals had plenty of eateries at all price points. I found many chairs to sit. Bathrooms were located at convenient intervals in each terminals and were clean with working faucets, liquid soaps and paper towels.

We asked several times, as did others, what to do about our connecting flight and were quite bluntly told it was basically tough luck and the only option was to see if people would let you cut in line. If that’s your only suggestion what exactly is your job role here other than to stand around and annoy people? We then had the same queue and problems at security therefore missing our flight. The staff at the Delta desk were also very rude and blamed the fact that it’s the busiest airport in the world. Clearly better systems should be in place if that’s the case.

The largest and busiest airport in the world, but clearly under-capacity. Bag drop and customer assistance counters had reasonably short wait times, but queues for immigration and security checks were very long, even at off-peak times. The immigration officer I had was much more polite and respectful than most of those I've experienced at US airports. TSA agents were polite and seemed professional, if a little laid-back. Some areas of the airport have better food options than others, depending on which concourse/terminal you're in. One thing that caused me some stress was the fact that I received different answers from different personnel. Every time I've passed through the US in the past, I've always had to clear immigration with my baggage (i.e. collect baggage from the carousel, clear immigration, then drop off baggage again). As my baggage wasn't on the carousel, I asked a few airport personnel, who were all polite and friendly enough, but they all told me different things. Some said always collect your baggage, some said it wasn't necessary because of my final destination, some said my luggage must have been lost, and some said to check at the gate when boarding (which would have been too late at that point). My layover was 2hrs 25mins. I only arrived at the departure gate around 20 mins before scheduled departure time, which was 40 mins after they started boarding. My advice would be to leave yourself at least 3 hours between flights but, even at that, you won't have much time to eat, shop or relax. Because of this, I will avoid this airport in future.",-1,ATL

Unfortunately, that's not true. As someone who's traveled extensively through the US (every week) and internationally (several times a year), I'd like to believe I've seen the gamut of airport experiences. ATL continues to be one of the worst on my list (rivaling SEA). The security screening process at ATL is an absolute nightmare. It's the slowest, most inefficient security check process I've seen. It'll take you well over 35-40 mins to get to the TSA officer who screens your boarding pass, and that's on a ""good"" day. The TSA staff can clearly see the huge line, but refuse to open up more checkpoints/belts. Worse, the airport monitors continue to project a delusion that the wait time at all the checkpoints is less than 15 mins. I'm baffled how they could lie outright like that. Another issue is the belts for carry on screening. They have a bin system, wherein you have to fill up several and push them on to the belt. Leads to all sorts of confusion, and I've timed it and know for a fact that it's slower than the simple ""push through"" at most major airports. Overall, despite being the busiest airport in the country, ATL has a huge scope for improvement in terms of the efficiency of the security screening and boarding process.",-1,ATL

Once you have waited over an hour to get through security, there was a group of about 10-15 TSA agents standing around at the security tower with their thumbs in their mouth. This is one job I’m sure everyone wouldn’t mind if they were all replaced by machines. Also not to mention the Southwest check-in/bag drop agents had the same type of I don’t care attitude.

I've traveled for over 30 years and have never had anything but kind, personable staff at this airport. This last trip through Atlanta was completely unrecognizable. Passport control was absolutely hateful to me and my 77 year old mother. He took our passports and hammered us with questions about our trip and when he handed us our passports back he literally said the words ""get outta here"". We were putting our passports away and he said ""go"". It's a horrible thing when I feel more kindness and freedom when I leave the United States. We then get to the security checkpoint and we have more hateful agents screaming at passengers. Their directions are so unclear and confusing that everyone was getting flustered and even seasoned travelers were now confused on what these agents were wanting. Screaming isn't a way to convey a message. Its inefficient, confusion, unnecessary and actually slows down the process.

We were there just for a connecting flight from Costa Rica to Montreal and we had to wait in line for 2h15 to pass customs. It is unacceptable! We didn’t have any baggage claim, it was directly shipped to Montreal. In other airport there is a special line for those who have a flight to catch soon. Here nobody care if you miss it. The most part of the staff was not professional. We had to take a night at an Hotel, without any compensation from the customs. It is not finish, I bought 2 bottles of rum at the duty free in costa rica, they put it in a sealed bag written duty free, but at the custom in Atlanta they told us that we had to put it in their special red plastic bag?

We got in the queue for immigration and were treated like cattle and shouted at to stay in line. I politely asked if my wife and I could jump the queue so we could be able to get our connecting flight. I was sternly told no and it would just be too bad if we missed our flight! We argued and I asked for the supervisor and was told the same so we did indeed miss the flight because of the ill mannered nature of the US border control officers. The UK is the USA's best ally yet we are treated like we owe the US a favour. TSA are short of a lesson in manners and interpersonal skills. Never again will I go through Atlanta and will avoid the place like the plague. I will say though that I found the Delta Airlines staff very helpful in finding us a flight 2 hours later and they were very sympathetic and aware that the US Immigration staff are a bunch of jobsworths at this airport.,-1,ATL

That didn’t happen I was booked on two different flights and both were cancelled. No reason, everything was blamed on weather. Today my flight is delayed again as we have to wait for a crew. The entire customer base gets to wait as they need to get a crew into Louisville to make up a flight there. Although you consistently advertise this as the largest you certainly don’t advertise it to have the overwhelming amount of delays. Also my luggage was already delivered to Louisville or at least some of it. I realize weather plays a part but as an airport a a major hub for Delta you do nothing to accommodate your passengers.",-1,ATL

However when we arrived it was absolute chaos, we had to queue initially for an hour to go through security, we were directed to a machine which took fingerprints and a photo then queued again for forty minutes just to have our fingerprints and photo taken again by a border official, we then had to queue for nearly an hour to have our hand luggage scanned and belongings checked by which time we had missed our flight too London. Staff in Atlanta are on a different planner, their streaming process is haywire, they don't want to help and basically kettle everyone like cattle into pointless queues and then have the nerve to have a go at customers for minor misunderstandings. Yes it was quite busy but not so much so to cause this much chaos. Also going to the desk to report missing our flight Delta were not at all interested and just wanted to move the problem onto someone else or rather blame someone else. I work in this business in the UK and am aghast at how utterly useless staff are here. Taking this all into account at the end of the day this was only a connecting flight, we were not even entering the US so completely ruined what was a nice holiday.",-1,ATL

We were stuck there for 15.5 hours with an employee coming thru 5 times with hot bottles of water, small bags of peanuts and pretzels. Thank goodness for chick-fil-a for the warm chicken sandwiches! My daughter waited in line for 3 hours with only one employee working to tell us there was no flights! They canceled our flights without telling us, didn't even try to rebook us.

I use a CPAP machine due to my OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) and on my return transit through Atlanta customs I was treated like a common criminal. I know the customs protocols because I'm still customs certified. Before I went through I allowed a flight crew to get in front of me to expedite their process. The TSA customs agents are very belligerent and unprofessional I can understand the type of job they do on a day to day basis. But, since they deal in a profession that requires you to have interpersonal skills it really leaves something to be desired! My machine was set aside and the agent I asked as to why. Initially she didn't give me an explanation she just said I'll get to your situation in the order in which I receive it in a gruff manner. As a disabled veteran who served his country I truly feel that this is something that needs to be addressed ASAP!

I am absolutely floored by the TSA disrespect in Atlanta compared to any other airport. It's a mess! Travelers are treated like cattle in chutes with TSA shouting at us. The new bin process to wait in a queue while bins pass before us is complete chaos. My belongings get separated and I now have greater risk of items being taken because I can't get through the screen to collect items. I now have to wait for a second bin to be allowed to pass into the bin screen lane. Throughout this process TSA are very very rude! They must truly hate their jobs. In contrast at other airports TSA are remarkably professional, courteous and helpful. What's wrong with TSA in Atlanta? It all starts with upper leadership to shape the work culture and attitudes of staff. Leadership should not tolerate workers who disrespect travelers. We are their customers. Atlanta Airport TSA - get it together!! This situation is deplorable and must change! I am a leader and know how to motivate, coach and hire staff who do excellent work.

The memories of endless immigration queues, officious and rude staff, missing a connection and previous reviews of this airport were still with us so it was a very pleasant surprise when we landed. Bit of a queue at immigration with, of course, the obligatory lack of officers to deal with several long haul flights landing in a short space of time. But there were plenty of the electronic entry machines so the queue moved along OK. Through in about 1/2 hour and then a long trek to the baggage reclaim where our bags were already in. We had a connection to Savannah and upon entry to the transit check-in desks were spotted and told we were already checked into the Delta Flight - so handed over the luggage and were off the the domstic terminal - all within 1 1/4 hours! Very impressive - and even more impressed with the personnel because, without fail, each person we spoke to was courteous, cheerful and helpful!

The new UBER pickup point at Atlanta Hartsfield is extremely disappointing. The walk to the designated area is extremely long and seems to be an effort to discourage UBER customers. This was definitely a hindrance to my arrival in Atlanta. Upon my departure, I used my CLEAR membership for security. I was again disappointed with Atlanta Hartsfield. I had to wait an extended amount of time as non-CLEAR members were served first.

Flying domestically into ATL and leaving on International flight is usually no issue and quite convenient. Returning to the US then connecting to a domestic flight is a headache every time. Two hours and 15 minutes this past Monday was not enough time to deplane, go through customs, find my bags and recheck them, then go through security again.

My wife and I were flying from the UK to the US to see the Total Solar Eclipse, we officially had just over 1.5 hours to make our connection to Denver, and were told that this would be tight. We actually arrived ahead of schedule, which was great, and then we got to immigration. Used the automatic terminals, which we thought were going to be a great time saver, but then we had to queue for an immigration officer, and our line didn't move for nearly an hour - what's the point in the auto terminals when you still have to queue anyway? Managed to get to our departure gate with about 10-15 minutes to spare (the ""Plane Train"" shuttle breaking down 3 times didn't help). During all this time no-one told us what the delay was caused by, and the (2) officers working the immigration desks were so slow it was almost unbelievable. By the time we finally got through the line behind us was huge, and there must've been people that missed connections - we were just lucky.

There are not enough employees to handle large flights full of people, especially since the majority have connecting flights to catch. The worst part is that the employees are rude and condescending. They seem to have no idea that on international flights most likely some people don't speak English and yelling instructions in a louder voice isn't going to help. Nor are inappropriate comments by an old man about frisking women in the past helpful. I lived in Atlanta for many years and unfortunately it seems like nothing has changed to improve this process.

The booth for this line had one beyond slow attendant. He spent an average of five minutes plus for one person. The line for US citizens had 4 officers that simply glanced at the passport and literally moved hundreds of people through as our line got longer and longer. We along with a few other US citizens got moved up in line by an employee. When he told us to go to the officer, we along with the employee where yelled at by an another CBP officer to never come up to the booth until called by the officer in the most rude manner, embarrassing the employee and us. The officers were nothing but rude and could not have cared less about the massive amount of people in line, most of which where missing their flights because of a multiple hour process. I do not understand why there was only one officer for what had to be hundreds of people and why they had to be so rude and nasty to everyone. I am all for security, but this was the most inept and rude process I have ever encountered. Atlanta CBP needs much better staffing and officers who are not so rude, angry, and slow.",-1,ATL

With hundreds of tired passengers queueing patiently and growing increasingly anxious as it dawned on them that despite having stopover times of over 3 hours they were not going to make their connections. Just imagine that. In that short time period one Sunday afternoon literally hundreds and hundreds of passengers had their travel plans ruined. What was truly astonishing was the fact that the truly miserable and obnoxious officials seemed to somehow relish the chaos they were causing. Throughout most of this time only about 4 booths were operational with most standing unoccupied. In our case, my family had 3 and a half hours between flights but we still missed our onward connection. I personally was led like a criminal to a locked room with several others in order to answer questions regarding something which ""showed up"" on their computer system. The Officer who spoke at me (at not to) clearly had problems understanding the system and eventually I was told that there was a glitch in the system and was free to go. Needless to say no hint of an apology. Having just retired after 30 years in the Police Force I am a staunch supporter of offialdom and of Police and Customs everywhere but I have to say I was astonished at the attitude of the Officers I met and the general shambolic system at Atlanta.

They would call ""Older than 70 yrs"" to go forward but ot was big group of men in their 40s. TSA people just liked to be bosses. I asked to move us ahead when we had 15 min till next flight and long walk, all I heard was ""everybody has flight in 5 minutes"". The terminal had no air conditioning, people are sweaty, TSA knew about delays and didnt care to call gates about that.  I missed my Sunday job in Omaha and lost $150. Hotel was $99. I am rating this service 1 because of a  Delta lady who was nice to rebook our tickets for next day. Otherwise I would rate it 0. We had no chance to try food or anything.

Like many other correspondents, we nearly missed our connection, having only allowed 3 whole hours to get through this mess of a 'homeland security system'. Two desultory officials on the 10+ Esta / visa checking desks. Nobody in a hurry, nobody bothered as hoardes of clearly stressed and distressed passengers who'd waited for hours pleaded for help because they were risking missing their flights (many we saw today did). Representative comment from man vaguely minding the queue: 'ain't my problem'. Then downstairs to join another massive queue to go through security screening again (we'd earlier spent 4 hours checking in and being screened in Guatemala). And all the while being barked at by staff standing around chatting (plenty of those available, apparently, after the Esta staff shortage upstairs).

I have seen the airport grow and change over the years. The changes over the years have been for the better! Notable things about Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): - there are two terminals the (main) Barbara Jordan terminal where all the restaurants, lounges and stores are, and the South Terminal currently Allegiant and Frontier Airlines. - there is a family viewing area outside the airport for watching planes and having a picnic. There are currently 4 lounges (AA, UA, DL and a Chase Sapphire Terrace) - there are many good places to eat including many local restaurants (my favorite are Taco Deli, Salt Lick BBQ, Second Bar + Kitchen, Annie's, and Juiceland. - it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end of the terminal to the other, along the way you will see lots of places to eat, drink and shop. Pros: clean, great dining, bars, and rest areas. The Delta lounge is the nicest lounge in the airport.

Austin airport seems to continue its decline year after year. Moving taxis and rideshares to an inconvenient spot that is poorly marked (albeit improved from a few months ago) is compounded by poor shuttle service for those traveling with luggage. The interior is beautiful and I love that they’re bringing in more local businesses, however this could never mask the abysmal experience in trying to leave the airport. The “shuttles” to the taxi stand don’t even assist with luggage anymore. It is such a hassle getting out of this airport I would avoid it at all costs if I didn’t have to go for work.",1,AUS
2019-10-11,0.4,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,a surprisingly disappointing airport,True," Simply put, Austin Bergstrom is a surprisingly disappointing airport. Before I venture into the negatives, I do want to highlight the positives of the airport: The terminal opened in 1999, and has largely, recently been renovated. The dining options in the terminal are largely from very local, and locally-themed, restaurants, something unique to airport terminals around the world (as opposed to a local restaurant being located amongst a terminal full of chains). The airport's clean, modern and fairly spacious even given its small size. The seating areas feel more like very nice doctor's offices than the traditional airport seating arrangements. Parking is close to the terminal, even economy parking, and it's reasonably priced. Access off Highway 71 is easy, whether coming from Austin and I-35 to the west or Bastrop and Houston to the southeast. The airport doesn't feel particularly crowded, even during peak passenger traffic hours. And yet, I can't bring myself to give this airport any more than a 4/10 overall rating. I don't particularly enjoy flying out of here. For one, the signs directing drivers to parking areas, arrivals, departures, and the correct lanes for regular vehicles and buses/livery are poorly marked, in my opinion. Even chaotic airports like LAX and O'Hare have better signage for such, strangely. Secondly, once you're within the airport, signage to direct people to check-in areas, rideshare and taxi pickup areas, and security isn't exactly the clearest, not the worst I've seen, but enough to make a small airport relatively confusing. Thirdly, once you're past security, it's surprising to find that the restaurants that serve tacos, meals, margaritas, beers - the things you'd expect to find in an airport in Austin and Texas are slowing down or even closed after 8.00pm. Fourthly, the personnel that work here are very hit and miss, but generally unfriendly. For example, the ticketing agent for Spirit Airlines (not exactly the budget airline with the best reputation) was very pleasant and courteous. The TSA agent who checked my driver's license, a super friendly and chatty guy. But, the shuttle bus drivers between economy parking and the terminal were little more than manner-devoid rubes. The actual x-ray screening agents for TSA were some of the biggest smart-asses (and not the fun kind, but the unpleasant kind) that I've ever met in my life, period. The restaurant servers and bartenders don't give customers eye contact while providing service, and can often be found tapping their feet while interacting with customers and not interacting with one another at all while working. That's the part that leaves me cold; for all the talk of Texas hospitality, it is sparse in this airport. In summary, there are much worse airports in the USA, but there are also much better airports in the USA and abroad. Only fly into Austin if you must!",-1,AUS
2019-09-28,0.9,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,5.0,the best experience we’ve ever had entering the USA,True, This was the best experience we’ve ever had entering the USA. We were literally the first off our plane through an extremely quiet immigration area and greeted by the most pleasant Customs Officer ever. He was so charming and full of local advice and obviously very proud of his city. He even searched for events for us to go to and could not have been more helpful.

Had to stand in line to recheck our bags to our final destination behind all the people that were originating in Austin (we had just flown 11 hrs in from Lisbon.) Other airports do a simple recheck right after customs. TSA very rude and inefficient. I’ve never had to separate carryon snacks for the X-ray at any other airport. Of course our bags didn’t make it and the airline won’t deliver them since the recheck made them categorized as late.

The garage is under construction and the signage for Rental Car Return is so dusty it is very hard to see in the dark (5.45 am on May 19, 2018). I missed it twice and had to ask airport security where it was. It took 30 minutes to find it, causing me to miss my flight.

The next morning the jetway was broken at my gate and the flight was delayed yet again for more than 45 mins. Both times, it seemed to take much longer than necessary to adjust to or fix these problems which is just unaccectable.

",False,"  This is the worst airport ever. As a business traveler and having just moved to Austin this year from Dallas, TX I never realized how spoiled I was living in Dallas and traveling from DFW. The city of Austin is in denial. This airport is so busy and doesn’t even have enough gates, not many direct flights, no services. Security lines horrible, traffic at drop off and pick up is a nightmare. With all the people moving in to Austin you would think that the city would expand the airport, expand highways and improve infrastructure. Unfortunately this city lacks major infrastructure. If you are thinking about moving to Austin think again. I am moving back due to this airport. This year has been nothing but living hell traveling weekly through this airport.",-1,AUS

The hall immediately past security has plenty of restaurants to choose from, along with a number of rocking chairs that have a nice view of the apron. The Gates 1-12 concourse also looked like it had been recently renovated and also had a nice selection of restaurants and shops. However, the pre-security areas and the Gates 20-30 concourse were dark and dim, and were unpleasant places to wait. Fortunately, everything at this airport is very close, so if your flight leaves from Gates 20-30 you can wait in the post-security hall and go to your gate at the last moment. Still, it'd be nice if the airport would renovate the Gates 20-30 concourse and the pre-security areas so that it looks as nice as the Gates 1-12 concourse.",1,BDL

Flight crew got off the plane and went to another gate 20 min after we were “suppose” to board. When we asked what’s going on we received nothing but attitude from the gate agent. Another gate agent walked up and totally ignored our concerns. We’re at B1 for flight 5253 to CLT. Shortly after the gate agent says there is a maintenance issue and they won’t be in for another 2 hours. We all had the same question: Why wasn’t the plane inspected the night before, being it’s an early morning flight. Secondly, why isn’t maintenance on-site during hours of operation? This is very unprofessional! If there were other options outside of this place that were closer I’d explore it because no one deserves to be treated this way especially early in the morning.

This is my 3rd experience with it, and I’m starting to piece together the scam. Don’t we pay a surcharge on every ticket purchased for the delightful experience of trusting TSA to keep us safe by making us remove our shoes and other useless acts. They keep the security lines long creating stress and panic so you consider signing up for Clear ($179/year and more privacy invasion with a retina scan and fingerprint capture). So the elite (those willing to fork over the dollars on top of their federal and any other taxes that fund airports and plane ticket fees) cruise on through security while the other ~97% of passengers languish in line and miss their flights. How on earth the warlord of the Birmingham airport allows 70% of TSA staff to service the elites on the TSA Precheck/Clear side vs the 30% (~4 TSA employees) on the side of the regular people, only makes sense in a corrupt government deal. I thought that this would be aggravating for the airlines on the other side of the curtain wondering where the passengers were who paid a pretty penny to fly like cattle while being prodded to pull their masks over their nose the whole time. But a little research revealed that the airlines invest in companies like Clear. Silly me. It’s a circular racquet probably formulated along the lines of the Chicago red light camera and parking meter debacle.

I have never walked as much as I have in an airport as I have here. The shuttle bus process is really bad. Driving in a fully loaded bus with NO air is un excusable. The two tiny windows that were letting a tiny bit of air were not enough. We ended up sitting on the bus for a good 4 or 5 minutes while we waited for 3 Southwest planes to pass.

One of the gentlemen asked a TSA agent what was happening with security. She was extremely rude and dismissive of him. So much for friendly and helpful staff!

I took the ""shuttle"" to the terminal. On the way home, in the baggage area, a sign said ""shuttles"" with an arrow. I walked and walked and walked with my bags to where there were buses.

My kids were in town and I had to take them to the airport for the return flight home. They are Minors so I went in with them to make sure they got on board the plane ok. I parked in the parking garage for less than 2 hours and was charged a full 1 day rate of 26 dollars. That rate kicks in at 45 minutes. I believe that is absurd. I don't have a problem paying to park but don't feel like I should have had to pay the full day rate. Don't get me wrong it isn't that I don't have the funds but it really the principle of it. I usually park off site because the rates are better and the shuttle service is better as well. I feel the full day rate shouldn't kick it until about 3 or 4 hours in the garage. I mean if you parked and took a flight somewhere it would take 3 to 4 hours to get there and back without really getting off a plane. So I turned in a complaint to the airport and was basically told tough luck. So my sentiment is Nashville Airport your customer service sucks. Do better.

You need to move.” By this point I could’ve been done and gone if he wasn’t causing an issue over me dropping off my relative and only being there for 5 min. I know his job is important. I know it is important to try and keep traffic going so it doesn’t back up. What I don’t agree with is being rude while doing it. Everyone is there to do the same thing.

There was bad weather when we left, so I can understand that these may be special circumstances. That being said, all flights were cancelled little by little.

Finally, after 24hrs of being moved around from gate to gate and delayed, they got us on a plane. The pilot explained what led to all the delays and why we are still delayed. The Airport has only 1 Defreezer truck. It can de freeze 1-2 planes then has to go refuel, which takes 2 hrs. So, we were waiting for our turn to be defreezed. After about 20 min, the pilot gave us an update saying that the defreezer has a malfunction and the tech is coming to fix it. A little later, we got an update that said: well, I can see that there is only 1 person loading the luggage’s, so this may take a little while before we can even move the plane. In the meantime, we are still waiting on the update for the defreezer. A few minutes later, the pilot says we just found out that the mechanic is on his way and should be there in about 30 min. Damn.

We’ve been using this airport for years and it has never been a good experience. Security and parking is fine, even with the construction - no problems other than if you have an early flight give yourself time to park if you need the bus. As far as food options... it’s terrible. The Berry Bistro is the only option on the Southwest terminal side to get any sort of coffee that’s to go other than Starbucks. Starbucks takes over 20 minutes because they are the only ones with reliable options. The Berry Bistro two weeks ago was closed because no staff showed up to work in the am. Today (like 3 other times) they’ve had our order wrong, over charged us and then didn’t have the items they said they did. When we asked for a refund they couldn’t because they didn’t have a manager to approve so they had to get change out of their wallets to refund us. All the other food options in the court area have cold food, even in the warmers, the staff can’t speak English. If your going to expand this airport you need to massively step it up with a manager that can oversee these places and hire people that care to be working for the day not texting on their phones at the register. This airport is WAY behind the eight ball, compared to other similar markets around the country ie., Charlotte, Orlando, West Palm, St Louis.

Everyone at the airport was so nice and helpful. They got help to him so quick! A lady (I’m not real sure who she was) got our flights changed for us and got our luggage off the plane.

Answered all questions and put us at ease, got her on the plane and in a great seat without having to wrestle with the masses that were waiting to board. A big thank you to Southwest also.

The security checkpoint was understaffed and the woman checking us in was unpleasant to say the least. No smile, crabby attitude and just not happy with her job. She asked a co-worker for some help as she had already called for help three times. I was TSA prechecked, but ended up having to take my belt off and go through again. Then my bracelets and go through again. And then once more through and a final pat down. All the agents here were friendly and just doing their job, but next time I think I'll just go through the regular line and it'll probably go smoother. Not a pleasant experience.",-1,BNA

Nashville staff were amazing - the TSA in most airports are the worst part of traveling! Most agents have an entitlement attitude, Nashville Airport TSA was excellent, something I've never experienced in an US airport.

So, we had to leave the line and get into another line. Fine, this happens, so we move to the back of a different line. Then as we finally got to the point when it was our turn. Then an airport person comes with a wheelchair person and goes before us, no problem. Now it's our turn again, but then another airport person comes with someone else, not handicapped and the two of them just rudely walk right in front of us. No explanation. No ""sorry or ""excuse us"", nothing. Of course, at this point I am now tired of trying to get through this line, so I had said ""Excuse me"". The airport person started flipping her airport badge at me saying she can do anything with this badge. She was scary, and I was really taken aback by her attack. Instead of saying ""Sorry I needed to get this lady through security"", she started yelling that she could call security or the police on me. I was looking to the person that was in the process of taking our ID and she did not understand what was happening either. We were just grateful that this rude, person was walking away now. I probably should have called security on her right away but didn't. This incident really bothered me the rest of the day and I really regret that I did not get her name. This incident happened around 12:30 PM on 8/28/24 in the security line",-1,BOS

I didn't know what terminal to go to. There was no info desk. A bunch of us were confused. I flagged down a worker and he said to take the elevator up. No one on the elevator knew the airport. In Athens, there was a huge info desk. I went to the Delta sky lounge, which was packed and dirty. And the food unappetizing. Mac n cheese, pressed meat. Why can European airports offer baguettes and great salads? And South Korea and Singapore have live music, beautiful seating areas and lovely lounges with showers. This airport was so lame.",-1,BOS
2024-06-27,0.4,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,One of the worst experiences,False,"   On Monday June 24, 2024 my Granddaughter and I were in line to get our tickets and check 2 bags in. There was a long line - when an employee came over and questioned all of us in line where we were going. She was one of the rudest airline employees I’ve ever encountered. She actually engaged in an argument with someone standing in line. When I told her the kiosks weren’t operating properly and that I’d never done a bag drop off and could she help me, she just walked away. I started asking her another question, and someone just interrupted her - and she attended to him! My granddaughter and I were in line for over an hour - yes, lots of people had issues and were at the counter for half an hour - but someone could have created a line with people who didn’t have any issues - just a simple need of a ticket and checking in a bag. One of the worst experiences I’ve had at Logan Airport!",1,BOS

But the airport impressed me as possibly the filthiest I have ever seen, including in the old Soviet Union. One of the women's toilets had eight stalls, FOUR of which were either unflushed or blocked up! I reported this to someone cleaning another toilet, who was totally uninterested in doing anything about the problem. Everything in the airport looked battered and worn, basically as if not upgraded for, well, a millennium. It was a dump--an unsanitary dump. It was an absolute nightmare for foreigners whose first impression of the U.S. would be this filthy pit.",-1,BOS
2024-01-20,0.8,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,very modern airport terminal,True,  This review is limited to Terminal A. I haven't flown through Terminal A in years but it still remains a very modern airport terminal. It is spacious with plenty of seating and dining options especially at Gates A12-121. There is a rather long underground walkway from these gates to the main terminal A. The walkway is beneath the tarmac and runways. We dined at Legal Seafoods before departure to DFW. Excellent food. The terminal was very busy given the snowstorm and delayed flights. Bathrooms were okay but could have been cleaner. WiFi was very fast and easy to connect too. Kudos to Logan airport snow clearing crews and the crews de-icing planes. Our flight to DFW was delayed but we managed to take off. Throughout the storm planes kept taking off and landing.,1,BOS
2023-10-18,0.5,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,the most unpredictable airport,False,"  Born and raised in the Northshore of Massachusetts, Logan is the only choice I have really when flying anywhere; domestic or international. My last experience at Logan was when I was traveling to Indianapolis with my partner to visit with his family back in July (2023). I've had both sides of the coin in terms of experiences with Logan over the years; really good experiences here with nice staff, everything being clean and organized to awful experiences where staff are rude, the bathrooms are gross, seating areas are dirty, disorderly queues and more. Both times going there ranged from fair to poor; bathrooms need serious cleaning and the interior needs an update & it looks like some areas haven't been swept or vacuumed in ages. The gap between great experiences and worst experiences at Logan Airport is one of the worst I've ever dealt with in my life. I feel like I have been going to Logan at the best times and the worst times and it is the sharpest gap between good and bad that I've ever witnessed. The airport in Indianapolis on the other hand is way better; way cleaner, way more organized, way more selections to choose from, etc. Logan Airport itself is not a bad airport, but overall there is better airports out there. Logan is in need of improvement though I wouldn't recommend it because there is such a sharp gap between the good and bad here; you may get the really good or the extremely bad. Better options out there. Sadly this is my only choice to travel. But to others: beware. You never know what you will get. Logan is the most unpredictable airport you'll ever witness. Think twice.",-1,BOS

Our next flight info was not listed as the monitors only had domestic flights displayed. Asked the counter they only told us terminal E no gate number. Then had to walk/run a mile to my connecting flight. Couldn’t stop for any decent food. The first Dunkin’ Donuts was so slow if you are rushing for a flight you def would have missed it waiting for your coffee.

The Immigration and TSA lines were the worst. We in line for hours waiting. Someone had vomited 3 times in the line and no one cleaned it up…disgusting! Agents were not friendly and were so slow. Once we left that area to pick our bags for a transfer for our next flight, that’s when we really hit hell. Long, long, ridiculous walks, no directions, no signs, no staff to assist. Never did find anyone at the Delta bag drop so once we entered Terminal A, the place was empty and cold plus only a few seats and we were stuck overnight with our luggage. Where are passengers suppose to wait? Airport hotel was way overpriced so we were forced to sleep on cold, dirty floor with obnoxious music playing. We’ve never, ever been to such a terrible airport. I feel really bad for visitors to the USA to have this as they’re welcome. Boston has plenty of money. Absolutely the worst airport experience ever. I will never travel thru this airport.",-1,BOS

But then the security check. I forgot a little handkerchief in my pocket. The security staff and the female officer was so rude. I apologized and went to put it back in my pocket. The female officer was yelling at me to keep it out and things I didn’t understand. I didn’t know what to do and what they wanted me to do. It is not right to expect that everyone in the world speaks und understands perfect and fluent English. Specifically at an airport you can’t expect that. The staff should be kind and understanding, But they were rude and insensitive. Speaking as fast as a high speed train and I didn’t understand. Worst experience at a airport ever. The female officer seems like she was thinking she is something special because of her uniform. Seems like they see every person as a criminal. Very bad experience. The staff should have further education in kindness and sensitivity or they shouldn’t work with customers and human.",-1,BOS

Upon arrival in Logan, we were told that the gate we had taxied to was “broken”. We did leave the plane for an hour while the staff at Logan figured out what to do. After getting through homeland security, the baggage for our huge flight of passengers together with the baggage of another huge flight of passengers was put on the same baggage claim. It took over an hour for people to get their bags, and everyone was packed in like sardines. It was a terrible experience.",-1,BOS

The border and customs were ok; however, taking the luggage, dropped the luggage, and getting to my next flight was frustrating. Talking my luggage was a long process. I think I waited for 30 min to get my luggage. Dropping the luggage was another line where I spent some time. The persons that took the luggage was slow and checked her phone instead of doing her job. Going from this terminal to terminal A was a very long and confusing walk. I think the airport can do a better job directing people. I think the airport should find a shorter way for people that transfer from different flights. Getting through TSA security is a long process and TSA officers are rude and very slow. Some of them were chatting instead of helping people in line. I address this to a supervisor and he ignored me.",-1,BOS

Insane traffic and no signage to figure out where to go. Had to Illegally park and get towed just to make it to our flight on time. And upon our arrival back this is the 4th time we’ve had to wait on a plane for an extra 2 hours after landing awaiting another plane to load passengers for a departing plane. Logan should look into adopting some of the European methods and utilizing buses for transport instead of waiting for availability of Ramp tarmacs potentially hire more people to get the job done correctly. Not likely to fly out of or into Boston again.,-1,BOS
2023-01-31,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Completely awful arriving,False," Completely awful arriving from overseas. We had to manually change our bags from the international flight to the connecting flight. Honestly not the biggest problem though. When we arrived, the airline did not give us new boarding passes and told us to go to the ticketing counter at another terminal which also inconveniently meant we had to wait for a bus. Bus driver decided to drive as slow as possible. Finally arrived at terminal B. Only to find more misinformation on how to acquire the illusive boarding pass. Obtained boarding pass from United kiosk, finally. Also one note. We had to go through security again just to get to a connecting flight. We get in security line and by now our flight is already boarding. TSA here is extremely unaccommodating. One of them even decided to get sarcastic with us and try and tell us it’s not his problem that we are missing our flight. We simply asked if there was a way we could get through quicker. I know his job is “super hard” and all but god forbid he actually does his job. Dude couldn’t have been less compassionate. Finally arrived on plane just as they were about to close the doors. Never flying through here again if I can help it. Awful place.",-1,BOS

I was out of the airport in less than 10 minutes after exiting the plane (I had no luggage other than hand luggage). The ground transportation options are comprehensive at Logan, and I loved the Silver Line bus to South Station, and it's incredible that it's free, which makes it more efficient as no time is lost purchasing a ticket. I was surprised I was not asked to fill in a customs form (I had not travelled to the US since 2019) nor was it handed out during the flight by staff. I don't know if it was the pandemic but I never had such a smooth experiencing travelling into a US airport from abroad, and I can't wait to return again to Logan airport!",1,BOS

Excellent shopping and restaurant areas (Legal Sea Foods is a must), and very clean toilets. Plenty of seating and relaxation areas. Duty free shop was a bit disappointing, though. The only downside is the boarding areas which are cramped. But can't complain, Logan has over 90 jetbridges, so you never have to board a plane through a bus like in my hometown of Lisbon, Portugal.",1,BOS

Once you clear security, one enters a new Great Hall with 75,000 sq feet of new space and 70,000 sq feet of existing space. All gates connect post security. The refurbished space is a world class modern airport terminal. It is spacious, brightly lit with plenty of seating and dining options aplenty.

I am in shorts and t-shirt and still way uncomfortable due to the temperature. I realize it is supposed to be Fall season but it is abnormally warm outside today (as tends to happen in New England), and a (theoretically) world-class airport like Logan should be able to adapt their internal temp accordingly.

Signage is laughable in how bad it is. I was with my elderly mother, with no idea that it was at least a 20 minute walk to the next terminal, and no signs to indicate if there was a shuttle available. Our walk took us outside, then through what was almost like a garage and some construction. Very few places along the way for her to sit. And you are forced to go out and back through security for a connecting flight? Maybe this is a US thing? Duty free was a small kiosk and with the exchange rate factored in, was more expensive than just buying liquor at home. I hope I never have to fly through here again. Thankfully my usual visits to Boston are by car or train!",-1,BOS
2022-10-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,This is the most poorly marked airport I have ever been in,False,"  October 22nd and 23rd Southwest Airlines. This is the most poorly marked airport I have ever been in. Terrible lack of clear signage. The fact that it is so huge and the terminals are so spread out, makes it imperative to have clearer signage. I am 63 and wondered if it was just me, but then I saw lots of people of all ages, stopping and calling friends to try and get help. Also, many people asking each other if they understood how to get to the ride app area or to their terminal. It was very chaotic. I have never walked so much in an airport: Up escalators, down escalators, then to this elevator and across another crosswalk. What a terrible mess. I was already frazzled when I got to security, and the employees only made it worse. They were surly and disorganized. One employee said, ""Stand over here and wait for a space to come available."" While I was standing there, another employee said ""don't stand there, move,"" The man supervising the luggage scan was rude. No one understood the process, and when I put my luggage on the roller, he yelled, ""everything goes in a white bin!"" People where coming in to the line from two directions. I stopped and helped two other ladies who were having trouble figuring out what to do. After I got through security, several folks were discussing how confusing the airport was and how rude the employees were. My son and I got to the airport early to take our time and have dinner. However, we were departing from two different terminals, so our only option was Dunkin Donuts. We walked another 20 minutes over to the Hilton and had a BAD dinner there, then sat in their lobby instead of returning to the airport, since there was no where to sit with each other outside of the terminals. I would like to come back to Boston, but between the airport conditions and the nasty UBER drivers, I am not sure it is worth it.",-1,BOS
2022-10-01,0.3,Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,Amazingly poor experience,False,"  Amazingly poor experience with transfer from International Terminal E to our domestic flight. Zero signage. After clearing customs there is simply no signage to tell you which airlines fly out of which terminals, much less how to get to those terminals. Confusing series of hallways that involve long walks and sent us outdoors twice. Goes without saying that we had to endure baggage re-check. If there was a bus or tram you would have no way to know it, unclear transit options to domestic terminals. I can't imagine how people with mobility issues would navigate it. Exhausting process. The fact that other reviewers have noted these problems and yet problems persist is commentary on the ineptitude of staff running the airport. Improving the signage would involve minor effort and expense and would go a long way to improving the situation. Ideally there should be one central security checkpoint after the departure counters and then a train to take you back and forth between terminals. As it stands now, this airport is a disaster for international travel.",-1,BOS

Boston is now on my never-go-again list along with Charlotte. I had originally booked via Boston thinking it would be more streamlined and modern. It was anything but. Confusing, contradictory instructions at customs, long walks, zero signage, long line for baggage re-check, unclear transit options to domestic terminals, nothing is walkable, very few charging ports, almost no eating options in terminal A. Altogether archaic airport, an embarrassment. Never ever again. Why Delta flies there I have no idea. JFK and Atlanta are far better.",-1,BOS
2022-08-29,0.4,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,,2.0,car rental and return process is so atrocious,True,"  The plane part of the airport is fine - the A Terminal is perhaps a little cramped, but there was enough seating and a number of options available for eating. Where Logan fails, however, is with rental cars. The cars are all in a common garage, and getting there for me was a 20 minute ordeal on a standing room only bus. The rental counters seem to always be poorly staffed, so you end up in a long line to get your keys. Also, when you're trying to leave the airport you'll most likely end up going through one of the tunnels, which have tolls that can only be paid electronically. I bring my own EZ-Pass, but if you can't or don't do that you'll be forced to pay the rental car company's outrageous prices for toll transponders, and the same coming back to the airport. Finally, while there is now a gas station near car rental return, it is 65 cents a gallon higher than other stations in the neighborhood. Logan is the main airport for New England; I often pass through it en route to Vermont, and it is the only part of Boston that I get to see on my trip. The airport's car rental and return process is so atrocious that it doesn't encourage me to come back and visit Boston itself.",-1,BOS
2022-08-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,a lack of help and accommodations,False,  For an international airport with international flights arriving and going on with connecting flights there is a lack of help and accommodations. Unable to recheck bags in order to go to gate area. Unable to go through security. Terminal c had only about 60 seats available while waiting several hours to have luggage rechecked from international flight. Even though there were (4) people at the jet blue counter they were unable to accept our bags. WHY were they there? Supervisor could sure use lessons on helping instead of citing “due to 911” the 4 of us standing here cannot help you. On a side note this is a very very dirty airport. Floors bathrooms etc. Will try to avoid this airport in the future.,-1,BOS
2022-08-15,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,"In the future, we will avoid Logan!"" ",True,"  It was so bad. My family of 4 traveled in and out of Logan to drive up to Maine. The incoming flight on Delta was ok, but the transit on the Blue Line to the car rental facility was awful. p.s. good luck trying to find signage that says where and what to do! The bendy bus (Blue Line) was crowded and it took so much time loading luggage on and off. We eventually got to the car rental facility and rented our car. Drove to Maine. Had a great time. THEN, we returned to Boston to drop off the car and catch a flight on Jet Blue. This time, the Blue Line going from car rental to airport was even more of a disaster. Overcrowded (some guy brought a bike on board and was blocking the luggage rack), no announcements - is this Terminal A? B? Oh, it's still B? No, its C! Where are we? When we finally got through that morass, we got into the JetBlue check in area. We tagged our own bags. Then, we proceeded to wait in a very long cue to just drop our bags off. The conveyor belt was not working. The was a Sunday morning in August when everyone and their brother is traveling. I cannot recall the last time we experienced such an inefficient system to get people from one point to another. I'm giving an overall rating of 2 - only because the people we spoke to were somewhat friendly despite their own circumstances. In the future, we will avoid Logan!",-1,BOS

We were checking in our bags to get home to Medford Oregon. We had a layover in Salt Lake. The woman at the Delta counter let my daughter's suitcase go through even though it was a few pounds over. My suitcase was over by 4 pounds and she told me I could transfer the 4 pounds to my carry on and she would not charge us extra. She told us to come right back to her and she would fix it. We did that, but she must have gone on a break. We had to wait in line again and when we got to the counter, the man there was so  rude. We told him what had happened he stood there stone faced and charged my daughter for the extra weight, weighed mine and I distinctly saw 49 pounds, but he put a ""HEAVY"" tag on it and wrote in 51 pounds, which I later discovered when I got home after missing a flight due to a delay and having to stay overnight in Salt Lake.",1,BOS

Some of us departed from terminal B on American Airlines. Those departing from terminal B, for American Airlines, did not have to remove shoes or take electronics out of their carry-ons to go through security. They ""breezed' through. Those departing from terminal A, for Delta Air Lines, had a very different experience. First, the man looking after the area to put items through the scanners was awful! He was more concerned with flirting with the young girls than assisting passengers. After being asked 4 times if we had to take off our shoes, he finally said ""yes"", but neglected to tell us to take our electronic devices out of our carry-ons. After a wait to have the bags examined and electronics pulled out, and sent back through the scanner, more than 20 minutes had been wasted.

With the amount of traffic, there’s not time to read the two dozen different lines on the signs to know which of the dozens of forked roads to take, whilst also driving and trying not to hit or get hit by the other vehicles, who drive way too fast on these roads. They need to have speed limit signs, police to patrol drivers using excessive speeds, and bring in a psychologist that understands how to format the signs to be more easily understand using average scanning and visual information processing skills. Compared to the simplicity of my local airport, Logan is just way too big without the organization necessary to be one of the largest in the country. And I’ve been in the area 20 years and there seems to always construction closures and detours.",-1,BOS

The second we exited our flight, there were people lying all over the floors. No seats in site, lines of people 100 deep, looking for help/direction. The bathrooms are super small, 2 stalls, plus 2 urinals. Which created massive lines. The majority of the staff was rude, thankfully we were able to find one angel in the bunch to give us honest answers about flight delays, etc. The food was gross, and just throw together. Staff could care less about any questions we had and seemed to be doing everything they could to pass us on to someone else. After multiple delays, a cancellation we were rebooked. While waiting multiple hours overnight for the next flight, myself and approximately 30-40 others were completely kicked out of the airport by an unmasked officer. Now remember at this point we are just over 2 hours from our boarding time, which is the suggested time to arrive. We tried to explain this to the officer and he could care less. Kicked us out and forced us to follow him and exit at the complete other end of the airport. Where we find a line of people he did the same thing to literally sleeping on the Linoleum floors outside TSA and check ins. I will never come through this airport again, can easily say the is the worst airport I have ever been in.",-1,BOS

We had a flight to Aruba at 6:00AM, so decided we would stay in the airport until that flight, instead of getting a hotel. We were able to make it to our gate, but was immediately kicked out and told that the area we were in was secured. We were asked to move to the public/checkout area, and we personally asked if there would be chairs, the worker replied with “yes, there will be chairs” We moved to the checkout area where there were 0 chairs or anywhere to comfortably sit. (see picture below of the vents we had to sit on) We were told we had to wait until 3:30AM to go through security for a second time. As we were waiting, another family with around 6 very young kids were also removed from the gate area, and were forced to try and find places to sit. There were none, so they walked and tried to find somewhere else to sit. Bostons Airport needs to provide some chairs or benches for the public to sit in the checkout area. It is the least they can do for the people flying in and out of their airport.",-1,BOS

I was connecting through Boston because I left from Paris to then final destination NY. I had a two hour layover which I figured would be plenty of time — I got out and had to take the bus to the next terminal which itself was very time consuming after having to do all the international security border checks, then when I went to Terminal A to go back in, the treatment was horrendous. People were the rudest I’ve ever experienced in an airport in my life. There weren’t many people but the lines were so disorganized and the staff were yelling just for the sake of being demeaning. The security guy looked at me and barked at me because I moved something within the bin and he yells “are you listening to me”. I almost missed my flight, and keep in mind I was traveling business class. The treatment within the check-in and airport was so bad that I’m actually laughing in disbelief because it felt actually comical. Like is this a movie? Why do I feel like I was just a prisoner being yelled at in a prison yard? Needless to say, will make it a point to never fly through Boston again, no matter what cost.",-1,BOS

This was important because my girlfriend was flying to Chile and she doesn't know a lot of English. Everyone was very kind and courteous at the ticket check in. No complaints about security or immigration, fast and efficient. Admittedly there were not a lot of people in the airport because of the upcoming storm and Covid but we have flown to and from Columbia in December 2021 and I have nothing but good things to say about Login Airport.

One of the delta checkin ladies in terminal A was next level rude as she yelled at passengers waiting in line, even refusing to check me in even though I was next because she didn’t, “didn’t want to deal with me” , so she accepted the man standing behind me instead. Luckily the lady I did end up with was very kind. The security staff was also incredibly rude and hostile with the way they yelled at people to line up. There was an open slot at the security counter so I went to take the spot when it was my turn and I got yelled at for not waiting until they told me it was OK to take the spot. I’ve flown all over the world and I’ve never gotten yelled at for taking an empty spot at a security counter. The hostility and tone of voice of the staff was really alarming.

The terminal appeared clean but after sitting for a short time we started seeing numerous mice scurrying all over the area near gates E7 to 4.

There were no directions given, so many stood in the wrong line for over 45 minutes and had to start over. Passengers were skipping lines, jumping over barricades, and the employees said nothing. We finally get to the actual security step to place our belongings in the bins, and our stuff was skipped over and over again as new passengers placed their items in front of ours. We had to ask an employee to please place our stuff where it should be in the first place. He acted indifferent, as they all did all morning, and seemed irritated we were even speaking to him. We have traveled all over the world, and this was definitely the worst experience at an airport.",-1,BOS

They treat everyone like a terrorist/criminal. Shout orders, yell at passengers. One older lady was yelled at to take her shoes off against policy. They did a pat down on me - I’ve had them before- but this lady was rude, pushy and took forever. Yelled instructions at me and insisted on repeating them when I told her to just go ahead. Then someone else pulled out a small cold pak in a ziplock out of my carry-on that is needed to keep my $800 medication cold. She threw it out (even though I traveled to Boston with it), insisted it wasn't cold anyway. When I asked to check, was yelled at for holding my hand out towards her. Another customer was trying to file a complaint for bad treatment and was told he had to back off and calm down and was rushed by security.

I am disabled and upon arrival at Terminal E I found no wheelchair staff (the BA agent had to call for one after I had been standing for nearly 10 minutes, which is physically difficult for me) and no skycap to handle my family's nine pieces of luggage. The driver who had brought us to the airport had to risk getting a ticket or getting towed to help my son get the luggage inside and then my son had to place the luggage on the scale with no assistance. After we went through security, we were taken to the gate to wait (even though we were Business Class passengers) because the lounges were not open. We also were unable to find food to eat or coffee because all of the shops were still closed, even though many restrictions in Boston have been lifted with regards to the pandemic. The only other time that I have experienced such a lack of service was in Seattle, which has a much smaller airport. Seriously people, if you can't provide a wheelchair or a skycap for a disabled person, why are you even open? The only plus in this entire experience was the gentleman who finally showed up to take me through the terminal in a wheelchair (after they called him). He was great and came back on time to help me board my flight. At least someone there understands customer service.",-1,BOS

First of all, I used mass transit, which connects to the airport real well, and I can’t say anything negative about getting to and from the airport. I also flew AA, so I can’t say anything about terminals A,C, or E, or the ease of inter terminal movement. Also, no, I do not know why there is no terminal D. As for land side B, it is a little cramped, but overall nice. Airside, however, is extremely open, airy, clean, and generally pleasant! The food options are pretty run of the mill, which was good as I showed up 2 hours before my departure to eat. Also, get a load of this, I was through standard security in 7 minutes, in New England’s busiest airport! The employees are the biggest asset to this airport as just like about every single person I met between Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, are extremely nice!",1,BOS

Most businesses and lounges were closed due to the low traffic in the airport, but otherwise facilities seemed nice enough and personnel were friendly. But they were blasting CNN at the gate and you couldn't escape it. After three hours I was going crazy.

I want to commend the people we dealt with throughout the Delta section of the airport. Getting of the shuttle I twisted my knee quite badly. We got into the terminal and the young man at baggage check called for a wheelchair for me. The attendant at the gate made sure to contact Detroit Metro as well as our final destination of Milwaukee Mitchell. She was also able to get us a few rows up which was a gigantic help. All the people we dealt with yesterday, especially the young men that had to push me were so very respectful and helpful. I'm very impressed and hope to visit there again.",1,BOS

My husband misplaced his license and called ahead and were told to bring other forms I.D. Which he did. The attendant wouldn’t give him a chance to speak and explain - she kept saying this is no good - it’s expired! And the rest of the TSA staff were just as obnoxious barking at us while putting our belongings into the bins. It is unnecessary as the airport was very quiet. My experience has almost always been the same at Logan airport - so be prepared. Lighten up - it’s people like you giving us Bostonians a bad rap!,-1,BOS

After a weekend of Proud Grandparenting of picture taking and such wonderful memories, I had taken hundreds of pictures on my iPad. Leaving Boston after a visit is always hard and we had the opportunity to have lunch a Limoncellos before leaving. Going through Security was a breeze so I went to wait for my husband to finish going through he had the leftovers from lunch so when he joined me I mistakingly put the iPad in the to-go bag. We went to sit down and wait for our flight and I couldn’t find my ipad. I remembered putting it in a case to go through Security but didn’t remember anything else. I was heartbroken. I went back to the TSA security but they didn’t have anything checked in I couldn’t believe I carelessly left it. I thanked the staff for looking so hard they went above and beyond for a Grandma who was just so upset. They told me to check back before my flight we might get lucky but I left forlorned. When I got back to the table that I had poured out my large purse belongings my husband was going through them again and then by some chance, I looked in my take out bag and there it was! While I was just getting up to go back to tell the wonderful staff I found it here they come heading around the corner to our gate to tell me to look in my take out bag. In this day and age who goes through that much trouble for one old lady. Thank you for hiring such diligent professional but caring staff.

After immigration, customs and rechecking you baggage you will have to leave the international terminal and go to another terminal. This means you are basically out in the street and you'll have to reenter the airport. Directions to the other terminal are poor and it is a long walk. When you arrive at the other terminal you will have to go through security with all other passengers entering the terminal, which can take a long time. The whole transfer from international to domestic can take a long time and is not comfortable. The Domestic terminal does not offer a lot of choice in shops, food and beverages.",-1,BOS

Waited one hour for an arrival gate, it was clear from captains voice that he was getting exasperated. When permission to open the doors was granted we stood waiting for 15-20 mins for ground staff to wave first passengers off plane. In spite of several hundred people queuing to get through immigration only two officers were on, both looked disinterested, unfocussed and lazy. Couldn’t give a toss. One left his desk to chat with a colleague who was passing. They chatted for several minutes about family, oblivious to passengers - queues were getting longer. Now been waiting 40 mins for baggage belt to start. C400 passengers from super jumbo plus other flights on other carousels - BA and Virgin. Probably 1000 plus people waiting on adjacent baggage carousels. No staff, couldn’t care less. Trump needs to sort out this appalling culture in US public services (worst I’ve ever seen, worse than 3rd world) before he starts criticising other countries. Wake up America, the impression you give to travellers, people spending money in your country, is abysmal. Worst I’ve ever experienced and I travel all over the world. No pride, can’t be bothered.

They have recently changed their RideShare policies and force their customers to be dropped off and picked up in a very inconvenient area that they have to walk to with all of their bags etc. simply because they are worried about the taxi revenue. Taxi’s are so scarce in Boston that there is literally no other way to travel to the airport. Do they expect me to walk several miles from my apartment?

If you have a terminal change or an international flight you have to exit and re-enter through different security. Not only did we almost miss our first international flight due to long security lines, but coming back in, all our duty-free bags were cut open and tested. All olive oil from Spain had to be poured out or checked. On top of extra-long security lines, losing a litre of olive oil to the trash can, the agent was rude as though we should know we could not take duty-free olive oil back. We asked prior to leaving the country and was told it would be fine as long as it was in a tamper-proof duty-free bag with receipt (which it was), but that is not the case.

We’d been to several other airports and we feel that this airport has a lot of room for improvement. The signs are not very clear. Even the signs going to the airport are not straightforward.

After I got out of the lot, I inadvertently hit the curb right outside it and I got a flat tire. I tried to move a little bit and it was impossible beyond a few meters away. I called AAA and they told me I had to talk to Massport. Within minutes, a policeman came and he had notified Massport towing trucks. He waited with me until the truck came. I thought I had a spare tire and a jack and all, but it seems someone had stolen them from my car at some point over the past few months, and I was unaware of it. The tow truck then towed me to central parking and I waited for my AAA to show up. As I was waiting, several of Massport's tow truck people passed by me and stopped to help and to offer help. Two in particular actually went out of their way to try and get me a donut tire to use, and they tried it on but it just was too big. They waited with me and helped me out a great deal until my AAA truck came. I am very very grateful to these wonderful people.",1,BOS
2019-04-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,,3.0,0.0,,,2.0,there was a bottleneck situation the other day,True," People arriving from abroad have to go through customs procedures and security checks, which can take an hour or more at American airports at peak times. Logan Airport seems at first sight to be well organized for this - staff to direct you, electronic devices meant to speed up certain procedures, etc. However, there was a bottleneck situation the other day because 3 flights arrived at more or less the same time, and so it took all of 2 hours from the time I left the aircraft to the time I left the airport. This in and of itself is unacceptable, especially considering that it was mid afternoon and only about half of the posts were open. But even worse was the fact that many of the people in line with me were getting very nervous because they were afraid they would miss their connecting flights. However, when they asked if they could go through first, they were told it wasn't possible because everything had to be done on first come first served basis. The argument was that people who did not have connecting flights would protest and would never be served because in the meantime other flights would arrive. Not true because by the time I got through there were very few people still waiting in line. I for one would gladly let someone who is in a rush for a good reason go before me and I'm certain any sensible person would do the same. Other airports have staff available for the very purpose of directing people who have little time to catch their connecting flights. Why not Logan? It's a question of courtesy and common sense. And it's especially important here because for many foreigners this is their first experience on American soil! A fine welcome!!",-1,BOS

There is only one way, in and out of Terminal B and C, so drivers (and passengers) need to be considerate of others to keep traffic moving. Taxi driver drive with the flow of traffic. UBER and Lyft drivers cause the traffic because they do not follow any rules and block traffic. I fly into Logan weekly and tonight is a perfect example of UBER drivers blocking the road so no one could drive out of the terminal. (200 were waiting to leave Logan and it was not a busy night at Logan. Thursday evenings are worse). It’s chaos, insane and very inefficient. For people arriving into Boston, it is a terrible first impression of the city. As a solution, restict UBER and Lyft drivers from Terminal B and C. Only allow pickups at Terminal A, Terminal E or Central Parking (like the old days with Black Cars and limo’s)",-1,BOS

The departure zone at Boston’s Logan Airport is Air Canada’s penultimate attempt to break their customers. It is the air transport equivalent of a Greyhound bus stop at a last stop gas station. If you have ever watched “The Good Place”, you will know what I mean when I say I think this is “The Bad Place”.

I use PreCheck for security and got through, and I am not exaggerating, in three minutes. The standard lane was not too much longer. Restaurant options are plentiful and not heinously priced, by USA airport standards. My most recent flight departed from terminal C with JetBlue. Gate area was impeccably clean, with an almost excessive number of outlets and cozy leather booths, as well as modern tables and chairs throughout the gate area. If you are arriving to Logan, make sure to use the silver line (SL1) to get to town. It can be crowded but it is free right to South Station in the center of town (about 20 minute ride). On your way back to the airport, it costs the standard one ride cost of $2.25.",1,BOS

I have been complaining about the international terminal for arrivals and departures for years, but was astounded by the change during my August 2018 visit. First, the nightmare of international arrivals has been completely alleviated for US and Canadians by use of the free Mobilepass phone app. I was out of the terminal (including picking up 2 checked bags) before my flight was even scheduled to arrive from Switzerland. It was amazing. Granted, few people were using the app and most were in the long line, but even those in the line were through quickly. Moreover, one no longer has to stand in that awful old hallway as in years past. The passport areas is expanded, brightly lit, and the line is organized and swift. And the wifi works in the arrival area. Second, the departure lounges have been completely redone. There are new marble bathrooms with fresh flowers, plugs at every seat, counter seats to do work and more food options. I was so impressed, I even took photos. Finally Boston has an international airport worthy of the great city Boston is.",1,BOS

2018-05-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,What an awful airport,False,"  What an awful airport. Every problem is under control of the airport management, US immigration and TSA, not airlines. Skybridge for international arrival was ""discovered"" to be inoperative. Passengers forced to remain on aircraft more than one hour while airport marshaled buses to drive them around the airport to another walk-in entrance. Baggage transfer location (transfer bags from international to domestic connections) staffed by only one person at desk; another staff gave incorrect instructions causing delays. US immigration required everyone to walk through a Disney maze for 5 minutes even though there were no other customers (late flight); had to use automated scan system; then had to go through another actual line with INS agents to do the same job. Way-finding signage after baggage transfer non-existent. Inquiries to uniformed police resulted in more misinformation sending us to locked doors, stairs without elevators and eventually walking outside to walk to terminal. Terminal design is terrible (as others have commented); but the simplest aides to overcome (signage and staffing). Because we were forced to go outside, had to go through TSA screening again; TSA staff were clustered together talking about their off-times and how long their hours were; and the few working were surly and slow. We are experienced international travelers. It is easier to negotiate airports in non-English speaking airports like Stockholm, Paris, Barcelona and Tokyo than Logan.",-1,BOS

This place is the most poorly-designed airport that I've ever encountered. I think someone would literally have to TRY in order to construct something more horribly inadequate for flyers. I had no issues with staff or anything, my main issue is with the fact that the terminals are segregated into tiny sections that are wholly unequipped to accommodate the number of people that have to occupy them. Security dumps everyone out right into the gate areas, which make traversing through the already puny space incredibly difficult. There are maybe four tiny restaurants in each wing (which means they're packed at any reasonable hour) and the gates have far too little seating. I walked around for over an hour before I was able to poach a seat at a random gate that had just started boarding. It's that bad. What a mess!",-1,BOS

Departure at 9.40pm was equally painless, check in fast security not bad, staff not the friendliest but the hardware they are given is cumbersome compared to that at somewhere like LHR. The only downside was the Priority Pass 'Club'.

While I appreciate that they do a vital job for the safety of all of us, and they are under a lot of pressure, the security staff at terminal A were rude and unhelpful today. I was told off by one staff member for leaving one item in my pocket, as if I were already under some sort of investigation. It was a clear plastic wallet containing money, which I did not want exposed to public glare. I then found four trays of my belongings piling up at the end of the runners tipping over, being pushed by the following trays, risking my laptop, kindle and phone being sent crashing to the floor. I had to grab them and was left with an empty tray to get rid of, with nowhere to put it, and no staff offering to help. My reaction was to throw it back onto the runners as I felt I had no other choice, and the staff thought I was throwing it at them. I admit my reaction was not the best one, but I felt pushed into a corner by the staff doing nothing to help me and being rather aggressive. When I asked where I could go to sort my things out the answer was ""I dunno, get outta here"". Unhelpful, rude. This contrasts markedly with the courtesy, helpfulness, and friendliness of everybody else we have met in Boston, including strangers. It also contrasts with the attitude of security staff at other airports I have travelled from recently, such as London Heathrow, Arrecife Lanzarote and Gibraltar.

It was the departure that was frustrating. We made it to the airport in good time - about an hour before take-off, made it through the first ID and boarding pass check quickly. Then the security bit. The TSA agents were flat out rude. Not only were they getting frustrated and unnecessarily annoyed with a woman who clearly did not speak English (after they asked her to do something 4 or 5 times and then getting progressively angry with her I finally had to tell them she obviously doesn't understand), but there were tons of them doing absolutely nothing. Both our bags were held because I had saline solution that I knew needed to be tested and my partner forgot he had carried in our water bottle. We and 2 or 3 other folks sat at the end at the security check point for (and this is a rough estimation) about 10-15 minutes before anyone started checking bags, but there were security people sitting around. Talking with each other. Standing around. And all the while our plane is about ready to begin boarding. I was furious. After waiting another 5-10 minutes for our bags to be checked and for my partner to go through security (a second time) with their water bottle we were finally able to make it to our gate. The guy who looked through our bag was nice, but it was like no one knew what their job was that day! Overall I hope I never have to fly out of this airport again.

They tended to their stations with a high degree of professionalism and exuded politeness and friendliness. What happened to our airports? How bad have we lowered our standards?

This was my first international travel in/out of BOS. My experience departing from BOS was smooth and timely. However, my arrival and experience getting through Customs and Immigration upon arrival in BOS was horrible. My flight arrived at approximately the same time as another international flight, as the lines were very long. Customs was understaffed. Upon getting through the automatic booths and the first round of Customs, you enter baggage claim. Here, even if you weren't collecting a checked bag, you had to wait in a single file line that wrapped behind the baggage carousels because Customs officials weren't organized enough to get set up for the number of people coming through. At this point, I was confused whether everyone had to wait in the same line whether or not you had checked luggage, and I asked two airport workers and neither could answer my questions, which was very frustrating. As the long line finally progressed (slowly because there was only one person taking the forms from us), one Customs official yelled at me for using my phone even though I wasn't at the booth and (I would like to emphasize) there are no signs saying you cannot use your phone in that section. The Customs official was just completely unnecessarily harsh and I would have been very happy to hang up if he had asked, but as I said goodbye, he yelled at me a second time, simply stating, ""NOW!"" On a side note, there was not a single female Customs official working throughout the whole process, and I find that very troubling and problematic.",1,BOS

Upon approaching staff they made sure I had every ounce of information they could think of to make sure I would be going in the right direction. Talk about outstanding customer service. Being that Boston is right on the great Atlantic almost every variation of food has some form of seafood in it (a plus for me... there's nothing better than a good piece of lobster), but it does tend to be overpriced. There aren't that many shops (at least where my gate was) so it might be a bit underwhelming for the fanatic shopping-passengers. The airport was mostly clean, but the washrooms could have had some more attention paid to them. Overall, Boston is an okay airport to transfer at, the staff are very good at what they do, and although you may get bored, you probably won't have an issue flying through there again.",1,BOS

There were at least 8 other tsa workers who were not doing anything, and did not assist the sole woman checking the bags. This equated to a 45 minute wait to get through X-ray and obtain my bags. Completely unacceptable. I had to run to my flight to make it as they were announcing my name over the loud speaker. I am lucky my flight waited for me.

The terminal I used - E - had a grand hall with complimentary internet, which worked just fine (despite only allowing free sessions of 45 minutes each time). However, I was a tad taken aback when I passed the security checks - which were very quick, I must say - as the terminal looked too utilitarian and did not really make anyone feel comfortable or welcome. I did like the many electricity sockets available and the rocking chairs by the windows. Also, the screens all over the airport only show the flight numbers, times, airlines and terminal and do not show if the flight is boarding, for example. It would be convenient to have such information on the boards, so that people do not rely only on the information over the speakers. Not to mention that some people have hearing impairments.",1,BOS

2024-08-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,my night was so miserable,True,"   This is the second time I write about this airport. Last time it was about TSA and this time this passenger passed through quickly without any delay to to my disability. However when the plane touched down after a day of travel this passenger decided to wait at the aiport overnight. Well, after overnighting at the SFO, I thought this would be just an ordinary thing. However my night at Baltimore Washington Airport was so miserable that I must record several warnings. 1) All the eateries and cafes are closed by 11pm 2) The workers are about as friendly and responsible as formerly at greyhound 3) hourly wage mentality prevalent, so whatever is not spelled out in the handbook is okay, including for instance having ground crew workers on break purposely sitting by visitor repeatedly. 4) actually the supervision is so loose that the people going in and out of gate doors to the tarmac/cargo holding area can be wearing any ID. The guy that was eying me at Terminal C had an ID badge but he was taking a lot more breaks than a job allows. 5) all the workers seem to take a lot of breaks and sit around throughout the terminals talking, even socializing like at Terminal A. 6) At terminal C, while I was quietly sitting and napping the red-alarm bell on the ceiling at the gate went off ""by itself' several times. It also did that at the gate across where I was sitting. The alarm went on-and-off ""by itself"" four times at least, and each time, when I was sort of dozing off. I had commented to myself that the music was objectionable, and they ""changed the music to soft jazz."" So evidently the security was looking and listening to me throughout my stay, since obviously very few passengers stay here during the early morning hours. 6) When I walked to Terminal A (where I hoped there would be no alarms) the security speaker announced my last name and terminal location and that security was ""on it."" So apparently even though I am an older disabled person with no record or history of vagrancy or crime, the airport security were ""alert to my whereabouts"" to the point of announcing my last name and location so all the workers could hear. 7) At Terminal A, another ground crew again tried again to sit nearby during his ""break."" When I sort of had enough of this and was muttering to myself, that evidently was shared with some cleaning staff, and two burly janitors (twins) who were heading to clean one of the men bathrooms in Terminal A loudly and repeatedly jeered at me. ""Why does she have to keep moving around that ch*nk as if they was after her?"" that kind of thing. 8) At Terminal B it was quieter because by 4am I found of group of nonwhites who were sitting in a section. However again, another ID-badge worker tried to sit near by while I was napping. 9) Workers were also resting or napping in the food-hall area. As a consequence even though the food-halls and other shops look very attractive, I will not have any desire to eat here. 10) The nice thing about this was that while there were no formal guards questioning anyone, there are apparently enough ""night crew"" who keep going in and out of gate-doors (plus the other hidden cameras and mics) that they don't need them. The strange thing is it was hard to tell who was actually a hired worker and a part-timer with a badge who just sits around and tries to harass visitors. This is obviously why unlike at the SFO or LAX nobody wants to overnight here, period.",-1,BWI

Now normally this is frustrating for anyone, but my daughter is autistic so trying to problem solve while in a heightened emotional state is a big struggle for her. Morgan is higher functioning and prides herself on how independent she is, but after a night of flying across country and running to connection flights, she was feeling defeated and concerned about finding her vehicle as the sun was going down. A bus driver named Chris on bus 407 was her guardian angel. He went out of his way to get her to the correct bus before it got dark when the main office confirmed they were too swamped to assist. He even had to deal with an angry traveler yelling at him for taking the extra time of getting Morgan to the correct bus connection although Morgan said he was very efficient and quickly navigated her to the correct destination.

Upon enquiry at the Lost Luggage room, I was told that the plane was too heavy, so my suitcase (which was not anywhere near being overweight) had been randomly selected to be rerouted (thrown off the plane) to another airport. It would therefore now arrive at 10 PM from Chicago Midway. So I was given two choices: wait at the airport till 10 PM for my bag to arrive, or go home and wait ""two days"" for them to ""Overnight"" the bag to me via FedEX.  Really, how much extra fuel would it take for my normal-weight suitcase to be included in the original flight? I opted for the former option and prepared to settle in for a three-hour vigil at the BWI airport. At 10 PM I was at the conveyor belt that ground staff said I should stand at to wait for my suitcases. They said the plane would be 12 minutes late. And so I waited. Eventually another showed up. She was there to pick up her elderly mother who was on that plane from Chicago. She expressed concern as it was the first time her mother was flying using a walker. I would periodically check with ground crew if I was really standing at the right place. They always replied with the same thing: when the suitcases start arriving from Chicago they would be at belt 3. But it wasn't until well after 11 PM that I saw the belt I should be standing it was now Belt 4. The ground crew had not bothered to tell me about the change, even though I was standing near their desk and in regular conversation with them. The bags started rolling in and by 11:43 PM I was finally able to retrieve my suitcase. When I questioned the ground crew about the delay, they were very defensive and said that it wasn't as late as I thought because it took a long time for the plane to reach a gate, and they count the delay from the moment it does so. So there you are. This was my unplanned adventure on December 27. I hope your experience with Southwest Airlines and the BWI Airport is better than mine has been of late.",-1,BWI

My daughter found a large raggedy cart that she placed our two large heavy suitcases on, then I pushed the cart while she pushed me. Then we walked not knowing where to go or how to check our bags because there was no workers around and this airport is very big. We did come across two police security officers who were of no help, we asked them to radio the airplane so that they would know we were on our way. They said no, they had no control over that and they were not affiliated with the airline. So we continued to struggle along and a man helped my daughter check our bags.

Kiosk was convenient to get tag for luggage. Personnel at the desk was very polite and helpful. We then proceeded to security and a couple of employees on the way were helpful and responsive to direct us. I wasn’t a passenger but was allowed to take my mom on wheelchair straight to the gate (my documents were checked and security point passed). Security check line was long but organized. People in wheelchairs didn’t have to be in line. Officers were focused and informed us on each step in the process. Airport building is spacious and constantly being cleaned. We noticed people cleaning bathrooms and hall handles. At the gate personnel was friendly and very helpful! Order was maintained throughout our departure. Five stars!,1,BWI

Our flight in Manchester was delayed and our flight on to Nashville was delayed. I went up to both of them to ask questions because the flight number on our boarding passes were different. I only wanted to know if the flight number had changed because the flight number on our boarding passes on the screen said already departed. Our plane from Manchester arrived after the departure time. He kept arguing saying we missed our flight. No we did not miss our flight if it was delayed. He was a very rude and hateful man whom does not need to be dealing with the public. No reason for the hatefulness and rudeness. Very bad for business. Airport is very nice and well maintained but customer service is horrible. The lady at gate A8 would not even help us at all. She said I can’t help you and don’t know what to tell you. That’s terrible customer service. I usually fly into here but more than likely will not again. Very disappointed!,-1,BWI

My 93-year-old mother was brought a wheelchair to the ramp and told, ""Oh, I can't push her to baggage. Someone else will have to help you."" I had recently had a left hip surgery and had to push my mother in order to get down to the baggage area. How can an airport with this much traffic, not set up a contract to help with their customers in need of wheelchair assistance?

The guy said ok, but a lady with a very nasty attitude told him no she needs to show her boarding pass but by this time my purse and phone with the boarding pass had already gone though the machine and they wouldn’t pass it back. Now keep in mind that I paid $85 not to remove my shoes and I wasn’t prepared so I was wearing shoes where I didn’t have on socks. But that’s not the point. The point is their system should be set up correctly for Pre-TSA customers. Then to make matters worse my purse had been pulled for extra checking and when they didn’t find me because I was being held up because of the shoes situation they made me wait while they checked others when I finally made it though the line and held me there for more than 5 minutes. Then found absolutely nothing in my purse. When he couldn’t find anything he took everything out to say that I was good. So back to my point.

I have utilized more than 55 airports in 10 countries both before and after 9/11. I have always loved BWI because it is very convenient for me. The TSA employees are by far the nastiest to traveling public than the security staff at any other airport. I truly believe the TSA staff at BWI actually hate the traveling public for making them work. Most obviously the way African American TSA employees interact with Non-Hispanic white travelers. This racist treatment toward Non-Hispanic whites extends beyond the TSA employees but most BWI employees down to and including the BWI parking shuttle bus drivers seem to have this hatred of people of light skin.

Oddly enough, checkpoints A and C were open for Clear customers. I missed my flight. So, if you pay extra for Clear, you get next level service even though I am already paying for TSA via taxes and fees. Not TSA’s finest moment.

Rental cars are insane distance away. Then the walk to the rental car pick up shuttle is just as bad. TSA is slow and the agents care more about who did what last night than moving things along quickly. They are among the most unfriendly in the country. I always fly Southwest out of BWI. Either to there or changing planes. They also have the distinction of having the most unfriendly southwest agents working the gates. Attitude and could care less about customer service. If this hub changed I, as well as a great number of road warriors would welcome the change. I use other airlines as much as possibly now to avoid this airport. And you want attitude or poor customer service. Get a cab at the airport to one of the hotels in the hotel zone. Yeah, maybe i don’t want to wait in the weather for a shuttle bus. God Forbid. The cab drives are rude and will have meltdowns when you tell them where you are going. I tip hefty and would have done more for them than most...but not when they cop an attitude.

It takes at least half an hour every time we arrive except when on an extremely small airplane. We pay airport fees don't we? This has been the case every time we fly into the airport. We have priority baggage but it's disgusting because it never gets out earlier. Would it help to write our representatives in the US Congress or in Md?

That was my experience for the departure. Check in was a breeze. Actually, since Southwest accounts for 70% of the flights at BWI, if you are on another airline it is usually easy. We were flying British Airways. After check in we had a nice meal at Passports Bar and Grill which was right next to our gate. Finished our meal, got on the plane and flew! Easy! Then there was the return. Not as good. First, we stood in line to check in at the kiosks. Then we stood in line to go through customs. The flight had 200+ people on board and there were two agents to process us. It seemed like a long time. Then finally when we got our bags there was yet a third line to get outside. I honestly have no idea what that last line was for. I thought they were going to check our bags and bag receipts to make sure we had the right luggage, but when we finally got to the front of the line we were just waived through. BWI is expanding their international section with the plan to attract more international flights. If they do, they definitely have to work on their arrival process.",1,BWI

First of all navigating through is all backwards. The staff are extremely rude. I went through TSA checkpoint and the guy working “forgot” he let me though when there was no one behind me and made me go through again. The bartender at the green turtle was hands downs the rudest bartender I’ve ever delt with. I then tried to just get fries from McDonalds and the woman taking my order didn’t smile, didn’t ask what she could get for me, just stared at me hanging / slouching over her computer. Lastly my flights were delayed three times. To get home I had to book a flight through another airline and I had 30 mins to walk out of the concourse and go back through security. When I got back in line was being yelled and had very inappropriate comments from the staff to me and felt extremely uncomfortable.

No transportation between the terminals which makes it hard for older people or for those who have health issues. You can get places but you may be late and exhausted or both. I would book a fight not to change here. The powering stations for your electronics are cute but poorly designed to handle a lot of people. You get one if you are lucky.

I have read some unfavorable reviews of this airport, but sometimes think that they must be talking about a different airport. I will say that this is a medium sized airport, so it will not have many of the same choices as the large airports. But I have used this airport for over 30 years and never had a bad experience. I have never experienced long delays at security. Usually five to ten minutes and you're through. One thing has recently changed that is a big improvement is the ability to move from one concourse to another post security. This was an issue in the past because Southwest handles about 70% of the flights to and from BWI, so the best food choices were in their areas.

2024-09-20,0.4,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,a lack of professionalism,True,"   I entered the TSA area to receive the routine security check. I had on a dress at the time, which I don't normally wear when traveling. When I walked through the metal detector, apparently my ""groin area"" on the scan indicated an abnormality? I was shown the scan where this region of my body indicated a red color. I was only told because of this, I would need a pat-down. I was pulled to the side and was told to wait for my carry-ons to clear security, so that they could perform the pat-down. The female TSA agent asked if I wanted to receive my exam out in the open or in private. I had a dress on, so I decided to choose the private examination. I was told to move to the side when my items came through security and that I had a couple of items that were problematic. So, I was told which items and that I wasn't allowed to bring them through (a scented body spray, along with a facial cleanser). I had no problems with these items on my departure from California to South Carolina. After this, I was taken into a little frosted glass area where I received the ""pat-down"". As I've never had one of these types of pat downs before, I was unprepared for what I was eventually submitted to. Another TSA agent came in so that two female TSA agents were present. I am a veteran myself but despite this, I don't normally make it a point to use this as a way to receive special treatment. The one female who put on her gloves and conducted the search was very cold, matter-of-fact and almost callous in her actions. She went up my thighs, pushing up against the sides of my crouch; she brushed her hand down over my pubic area. I automatically moved away from her hands. She had to do this 2-3 times because I kept moving. It was unintentional because my boundaries were being breached, an involuntary reaction. The one agent coldly stated that if I moved again, she would have to performing the action. I am a very tolerant person when it comes to people doing their jobs, but I felt assaulted and triggered. I got angry and teared up but allowed these insensitive, cold agents to finish. I knew that they knew I was upset even though I didn't say anything. I have PTSD, so I feel like this kind of touching shouldn't be allowed. We left the little room, the agents took my items, put them on a table and walked off. No courtesy, no nothing. It angered me. I retrieved my items on the table from the containers and tossed one on the floor and walked off to my gate without looking back. I went to a restroom, changed out of my dress into a shirt and pants. Later on, I ran into another person on my flight who had gone through TSA with her mother, who's in a wheelchair. She also had to go through the same invasive exam. Their experience wasn't long before my experience in terms of time. After, this TSA scenario when I arrived at my gate for my flight, I found out that my flight was delayed. Because I downloaded the app of the airline to my phone I was able to change my connecting flight on the suggestion of my app. While waiting along with other frustrated but resigned people, I kept hearing these announcements over the PA system about one particular flight that kept getting changed to different gates. THEN the ticket agents at my gate kept asking people to check their carry-on bags. Apparently there wasn't room enough on the flight for carry-ons. I had a feeling of a lack of professionalism, despite my personal experience. Thank goodness I won't have to visit SC again.",-1,CAE

The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast.

This last time they confused a portable monitor for a tablet and got annoyed at me for their ignorance, and said I had four laptops. I had just one laptop for work and a small tablet. I have been the TSA at BNA, ATL, GSP, ORD, SFO, ONT, MKE, and Monteray (MEX) with the same gear this year without a problem. Yet Cleveland TSA has got to be obnoxious about it. The Airline ground staff at Cleveland has always been amazing, especially with Delta, and United, friendly helpful, and present, in my opinion, they make up for a lot of the facility's shortcomings.",-1,CLE

Today, 3/3/24, I checked my bags and saw that the line for security was the entire length of the airport! While we were waiting in line, we were offered “CLEAR” for a faster way through security. We never would have made our 10:50am flight, despite arriving at 8am. So, we spent the large sum of money on “CLEAR” to ensure our vacation was not ruined. The people in security used the excuse that traffic was high for spring break. I didn’t see any groups of young people that looked like they were going to a beach. Spring break is still a week or two away! The problem is poor staffing and planning. I use to fly twice a week through Hopkins for 12 years and never experienced the ridiculousness that I experienced in December and again today.

Every time I go through security at Cleveland is unnecessary slow and some issue with TSA. They are the rudest agents that look for problems and overreact to everything. I fly LAX and ATL frequently with no issues ever. This trip out of Cleveland they wanted to do a full pat down because a coin sized yellow dot came up in my jeans pocket area when I went through the x-ray machine. I asked to check my pockets and go back through and they refused, used intimidation tactics of getting in my face to make me submit to a pat down. I refused and was kicked out. Checked my pocket and a penny had snuck up in crease. You would think professional TSA agents would be able to recognize a coin when they see it and not subject a traveler to be felt up. Other airports wouldn’t have done that. They also wouldn’t allow me to touch my cleared luggage or purse until I submitted to pat down. Complete harassment on every level.",-1,CLE

I would much prefer to use Canton/Akron but end up using CLE when the deal is just too good to pass up. I flew out this past Saturday and watched a bunch of employees walk around with little idea of how to get a crowd through security while employing some type of social distancing. One woman walked around simply shouting ""6 feet"" and an employee standing in the CLEAR aisle actually argued with a customer about why CLE just wasn't prepared for the crowd that morning. I do not pay for pre-check, but the gentleman in front of me did, and he was irate that there wasn't even a pre-flight aisle open and he was stuck in the same inefficient line with the rest of us.

I don’t think that I’ve had a positive interaction with an employee there ever. They are very off-putting and rude. This is my home airport and it’s a shame that this is the impression that we give to people. No one is helpful. They don’t seem to want to be friendly or even pretend that their jobs is bearable. They are unprofessional and do not care to help anyone. There is a lack of seating in the airport. For some reason Concourse C is an absolute disaster at peak times. The wireless chargers seem cool at first, until you realize that most of them don’t work. Even the new ones. The walk time to get to your gate is average. No complaints. It’s expected for a major airport. My last flight had to be diverted for 4 hours due to the Charlotte Douglas employees not dumping the lavatories. Nice. Great job. We won’t even get started on the circus that is the arrivals area. Major traffic back ups. Construction with lanes closed. Employees blowing whistles. Yeah, that was a great idea and helped tremulously. Note my sarcasm. The management of the airport needs to get it together or hire someone who can.

This morning they closed the line but instead of closing after the 4 people in line, they cut it and made 4 people walk down to A with 1 worker rather than close the line at the end.

People moving in mass between C1 and C3 based on word of mouth. Have flown 1000’s if flights across US, Caribbean, Europe and even Africa.

After waiting in a long line I purchased a cup of the worst coffee I ever had. I would have returned it but I expected they would not know how to handle it. I tossed it in the trash. I headed to my gate via the very crowded halls. I stopped to use the restroom only to find it unusable. The facilites were dirty and wet paper was on the floor of the stalls.

Firstly, why doesn't this huge airport have a tram service. My flight from Richmond arrived at one end of the airport and connector to Pittsburgh at the other. We had been held on the ground for 3 hours because of weather and then 1 hour in the air. I am 84 and pretty healthy but could not have made the connection on foot 50 years ago. American Airlines did not give us connecting gate info upon deplaning. Told us to check message boards. I became lightheaded--no food or water for at least 3 hours while cramped on the arriving flight. When I realized that my connector was at the other end, there was no one to ask for help. Numerous passengers tried to get airport employees to help me and finally someone from American arrived with wheelchair. Develop a tram service. Not just for oldsters but for persons with young children. This is not a family friendly airport. Also 37 minutes is not at all sufficient time to make a connection. This is totally inaccurate information for the traveler who hasn't experienced this airport. Yes, it is growing. So, add a very necessary service consistent with this. I will never use this airport again.",-1,CLT

Our flight was late, arrived at a gate across the airport from my following American airlines flight. Ran to the gate where they refused to let me on because I was late. What the is wrong with your layout and why do I have to run across the airport to find the same connecting airline I was just on?

It was good that I was in a group of travelers of more than 20 persons, the flight made delay for few minutes for us. Very nice airport having a lot of shops and restaurants.

So we proceeded and waited. So, first...the customs agent whose line we were assigned was horrible he was lazy and yawning at us. He was slow to do anything, it was actually laughable but sadly it didn’t end there and quickly became un-laughable. Charlotte has and is still undergoing renovation so it changes every time we connect through there. There is a huge lack of employees prepared to herd the crowds of travels. So, after another disappointing encounter with our carrier (who is getting their own earned review) we finally got onto a flight. But, of course our luggage did to make it home with us. Not surprised, not horribly upset because I still trust it’ll get here. Just goes to show employees at CLT don’t give a damn!

I arrived at 4:30am to the airport and there was only one checkpoint open. The line went the length of the terminal. Many people were in danger of missing their flights. I pivoted to line up to wait for another checkpoint which was to be opened at 5:15am. You could see the TSA agents sauntering around on the catwalk above the queue. There was absolutely no sense of urgency. Then, at 5:15am when the metal shutters opened, we learned they were training a service dog, and that we needed to walk side by side slowly past the dog to help with the training. Poor planning on TSA and the airport's part. When there are early flights, have at least two checkpoints open. When it's a dog training day, open up the checkpoint earlier to accommodate the dog training. I made my flight with about 5 minutes to spare. Others were not so lucky.

The whole process took aver 15 minutes. After I put my personal belongings on the belt, I was asked to go to another area, away from my belongings to go through the scanner.

We arrived from Salt Lake City on a delayed flight, but we thought ""No problem! We will have 2 hours until our next connection to Pittsburgh."" At the terminals, there were thousands of people but only enough seats for about 30 people per gate so hundreds of people were crowding into the concourse. Even more people sitting on the ground around the concourse and many more waiting in line at American Airlines customer service - so it was incredibly crowded and a safety hazard. There wasn't enough seating in the food court, either. Almost every flight was delayed or cancelled. Our flight was supposed to leave at 8:30pm (already delayed) and we didn't actually leave until about 11pm. The floor was dirty and smelled like urine (likely from all the pets/service animals standing around). The women's bathroom had a broken unusable door and a long queue. To add to this, despite having 5 hours to get my bag on the plane, 1 of our 3 bags didn't make it to our destination. We had been travelling with 2 adolescent children all day and everyone was very tired and unimpressed with Charlotte over all the airports we've been to so far. It has a Cinnabon (one of the places on my list) and a bunch of other food choices, but good luck finding a place to sit. The wifi worked for me, but not my husband.",-1,CLT

People working seem unable to give directions without yelling out repeated information that has nothing to do with the questions asked. That or acting like they are completely ignoring you while gesturing. They made us take out our laptops from our bags and from laptop sleeves, both things I haven't had to do in years. They informed us of this by just yelling to take our time and hurry and remove everything. ""Remove what? Liquids?"" Response: ""take your time and hurry and remove everything."" ""Ok, so my liquid? All electronics?"" ""take your time and hurry and remove everything! But not that! Keep liquids in your bag! Laptop out! Hurry up!"" Just absolutely horrible. I get through security, try and board the plane. In the time I checked in (about 6 hours prior) and selected my seat (which I really just confirmed because the plane was full and it wasn't the worst seat) they changed my seat. Like, my digital boarding pass was invalid. Then they told me that my bag was too big and that I was required to check it. I have flown 5 flights in the last 3 days. Not once did they question it. The person in front of me had a larger bag in every dimension. I compared it as I stood in line behind/next to them for 10 min. They got on with no problem, and when I asked the ladies about it, they just ignored me. American has been changing everything about my trip constantly (example with the seat). I am unwilling to part with my bag because of this. I will never see it again. They print me a check bag tag even though I tell them not to. I end up removing a pair of jeans and two flannels which I put on, so I can zip it more. I ask, ""Can I get on the plane now?"" She walked away and threw away my checked bag tag. I asked again, ""Can I get on the plane now?"" She looks at me. I gesture at the bag, and ask again, ""Can I get on the plane now?"" And she finally whispers, ""yes."". Why lady, why? I am not a reactive person. I haven't reacted about anything on my trip that has been now 72 hours of traveling. I've gone with the flow, I've been respectful. I just don't know how to deal with people sometimes. All ratings below should be 0 or 1 if 0 isn't allowed.",-1,CLT

This is by far the absolute worst. It is shocking that Memphis, TN has a far better looking facility than this one. And please, spare me ""all the constructions and improvements"" that is taking place. There is a serious lacking of decent places to eat, the seating is awful and the infrastructure is typical of anything in North Carolina...non existent. You waited far too long to start expanding folks. Just like the roadways around the State and yes, I can say this because I'm from here. Outdated, filthy, horrible signage, no direction as to which line to get in to check in, and some of the worst communication amongst airport personnel of what's what, where to go/not go, etc. American needs to seriously reconsider this as their hub.",-1,CLT

American has made a hub out of CLT with no infrastructure to support it. Currently sitting on the tarmac for close to 30 minutes & counting while we wait for the pilots to arrive. Out of the maybe 20 times I’ve had to connect through this airport in the last 2 years, I’ve only had an on time connection or departure ONCE. The general demeanour of staff / vendors working at the gates or shops / restaurants are mostly straight up rude. Likely because they tire of people complaining about delays.",-1,CLT

There are no seats at boarding areas. The corridors are narrowed and almost impossible to navigate. The staff is unaccountably rude. In Pittsburgh, we are building a new airport for diminished air traffic compared to what the previous airport 25 years ago was built for.

When we arrived at the airport there was know one to assist her into the airport as we waited over 20 minutes outside in the cold. We went into the airport and once again there was no one to assist her to the terminal. Then she was thoroughly looked over and woman handled to thoroughly check for bombs and other paraphernalia because this 53 year old woman dealing with brain cancer looks like a terrorist. (hardly) Imagine my shock as I returned to my vehicle to find 4 yep 4 parking tickets due to leaving my keys in my SUV. Meanwhile I spoke with airport security and asked them if my SUV was ok to be parked in the designated handicap spot while I attend to her. Every time they said yes. I have paid my tickets and I will never fly out of Charlotte again! We will be going to Hawaii for Valentine's Day! Guess which airport we will not be using?!,-1,CLT

They opened a 2nd for the last 10 minutes, but really what’s the point. Who comes to the airport for slow fine dining? Practically no one. So why oh why would you make me wait 20 minutes for pizza?

They closed parking close to the airport under the guise of online reservations only. I’m a business traveller so use this airport a lot when I arrived I asked when did this start, first lie as the response was we’ve been doing this for quite some time. I travelled out last week and this wasn’t in place. There is a management company trying to control traffic within the parking areas by closing down certain sections and all it’s doing is upsetting the business travelers that use the airport frequently.

Came in from a 1 week vacation on a Saturday evening. The passport control took 2 hours. Only had 6/15 stations open to process probably 1000 people!

Have you seen those chickens jammed into a cage 40 of them that should only fit 2, well that’s what this is. You have hallways as wide as a middle school but enough people to fill a professional football stadium trying to walk, stand, board, move or eat. The absolute worst airport I have been to, and I have been to over 100 countries, and thousands of airports. People can’t get anywhere with a wheel chair, they do have construction, but not as much as needed. They need to expand massively and in a hurry, not the slow pace doing one small portion at a time. If you don’t like being so close to other people that there genitals are rubbing on all sides of your body at the same time then avoid this airport, it’s not that people are doing it on purpose, it is the fact there is zero room to walk.",-1,CLT

We had to wait in an obscenely long line to get back through security for our connecting flight and there were only 2 out of 5 security checkpoints open. There were hundreds of people waiting.

In 50 years of flying I haven’t ever experienced anything as bad as this. We changed planes here and during the thirty minute walk from B to E, everyone we encountered was rude and unfriendly.

People pushing & rude. Shocked no fights occurred yet close calls. It appeared to be only 2 shuttles running to parking lot 1. No signs for direction. A big safety issue. However, the wait was so long that I understood the urgency. Why not run the number of shuttles based on the peak hours. Probably waited about 1 hour for the short ride & this was due to being aggressive. Something needs to be done by management immediately before there’s a serious fight or major safety incident because of people stepping over others to get on & off the shuttle buses.",-1,CLT

Have been all over the United States and Europe over the years and no airport has he mass confusion! I stood waiting for a pick up and the cars stood absolutely still for well over 20 minutes and the cars in front of me did not move. the cars were all parked waiting for passengers that were not outside yet. There was a young lady walking down the roadway with here little red flash light just walking by the stopped cars. I said something about people stopped and just waiting and she just shrugged her shoulders! Saw her a few minutes later at the cross walk ... there is stripped lines across for pedestrian crossing. This jam has been happening every time I come back from a trip for the last 8 months. Something needs to be done about this. I won't even start on baggage claim. I have waited at least once for 45 minutes for luggage. The cell phone lot is terrible, you have don't have an arrival board so people can see if the fits have actually arrived! No restrooms in case the flights are delayed. Maybe you should look at the Tampa International Airport for an example of GOOD AND WELL ORGANIZED CELL PHONE LOT. You having nothing but an ordinary parking lot. its a shame visitors have to view the disorganization of this airport",-1,CLT

The employees are very rude and short and don’t care anything about the passengers. Long lines, so many lines. I estimate that I showed my passport 5 times and the walk to the connecting flight was very long. TSA were barking, move along. I said I’m trying. I’m older, have serious health issues and she could see I was hurrying. I asked directions to a terminal and an employee just said read the signs. I later found the signs but the were out of my vision- obstructed. Just don’t go there.",-1,CLT

This is a very busy airport with overcrowded concourses and a dearth of sitting at the gate area, resulting in a spill over to the concourses. Combine that with the long lines for dining on either side of the concourses and you have thick crowds to navigate through. Long walks from one concourse to the another can be expected depending on your connecting flight. On outbound flight to PVD, I had very long walk from Concourse B to The Club at CLT in Concourse A. On inbound flight from PVD, my connecting flight was a short distance (5 gates away). This allowed me to make my connection easily.",1,CLT

Now security won’t let me back in the terminal because my flight is tomorrow morning, not tonight. Even though I have a legal right to be in the terminal. But hey, what can you do right Officer Wheeler? I definitely planned to fly to see my mother in the ICU, only to get stuck outside your checkpoint when making my way back to Montana. And all this started because the USO was closed, hours 6am-6pm. When veterans typically need access to it at night, so we have somewhere safe and secure to sleep.

Restroom trash cans are overflowing, urinals need a hosing, terrazzo floors need a buffing, escalators and walkways are in constant state of ""under repair"". The airport has been a construction expansion mess for way too long and temp barriers are falling apart. It feels like Charlotte ran out of money and has abandoned the place.

Which of course meant an incredibly long walk from the far end of Concourse E to the far reaches of Concourse A, battling thick crowds the entire time. And don't even think about trying to get something to eat here - everything has crazy lines and the airport also starts shutting down after 7 pm. We were racing to another concourse to get food from the one remaining open fast-food restaurant at 7.30 pm and barely made it back to our plane for boarding. The entire airport is a classic example of a small regional facility that has greatly outgrown its facilities. The architecture is nice enough in most places, but it's simply too many people crammed into to too many narrow hallways with no inter-terminal train system and endless extensions of extensions as their only solution. Not a pleasant place to be. Move the hub back to Pittsburgh or an airport that can better handle the load.",-1,CLT

I am embarrassed that the staff at this airport is a representation of Americans to those traveling to the US for the first or any other time. Every staff member with the exception of an officer in customs was rude and unfriendly. One lady in customs asked my 13 year old son to stay in the back of the line when he stopped to tie his shoe without us realizing that and told him he could not join his family and needed to learn what a line was. There is not enough space to talk about the rudeness and lack of courtesy the TSA staff had. The Jersey Mikes staff had only our family in line and took them 20 minutes to make 4 sandwiches.

We were told our luggage would go to our connecting flight and not baggage claim, unlike what the AA app told us. While getting on the plane my mother's baggage was showing it was on the plane but mine wasn’t. I looked out the window and saw my very unique bag that, after 20+ flights, I’ve never seen another one of on a nearby dolly. I asked the crew to check the bag and look for my name. They looked and said, “oh those are going to myrtle beach.” I checked the app when we landed at our final destination after realizing my bag was delayed for sure, and sure enough, my bag was in line to go on the wrong flight - to Myrtle Beach (per the AA site). That was my bag. We were delayed for 2 hours. There’s no good reason my bag should have been mixed up with the Myrtle Beach flight, and the bag crew didn’t really check to make sure it was my bag. I watched them just quickly look at the destination and not my name. I’m very disappointed, and still waiting a day later on my bag with no real updates on when it will be delivered.",-1,CLT

This was consistent throughout the entire airport. My daughter and I were flying for the first time in a long time and we were appalled at the attitude of the TSA employees, the Bojangles employees, and the market employee. I don't understand how all of the employees throughout this entire airport all share the same negative and rude attitude.

There is a bar there with deli style food and sodas. The kiosk was not working so several people, more then 20, went over to the ""bar"" register and was told that she was sorry but she could only sell alcoholic drinks but would call someone to fix the kiosk. After standing there for 35 minutes in which she didn't even call anyone but continued serving drinks and more customer were turned away for the Fresh Market sandwiches and sodas, I asked again for her to call someone. She told me to file a complaint and step away. Wow, so the Charlotte Airport Fresh Market is more then happy to sell you booze but not food and sodas which is needed because airlines do not provide those. Also, I repeatedly asked people wishing around in collar shirts and walkie talkies and all they could say is they worked for AA but didn't know how to get in contact with anyone. So I sat for almost 3 hours waiting for my flight, not eating or drinking because I wouldn't purchase booze from fresh market.

The airport is simply not set up to handle the crowds pumping through there. If you have a connection that is less than an hour, you can forget about any food options due to super long lines at all of them. If your lucky, the lines at the Hudson news type places will only be 10 people long and you can grab a snack. I fly nearly every week and connect through Charlotte at least 4 times a month, it’s always the same. Staff for the most part is okay, unless you are in the regional jet area E gates.

Airport volume is back to normal yet through three terminals there isn't a single place to buy a simple coffee. Seriously, what sadist has no available coffee at 6am?

The crowds on departing bordered on mass hysteria. Bumper to bumper passengers. Was difficult to tell where lines started or ended. Most passengers were funneled thru gate E. Employees screaming directions to tell passengers where to line up. Terminal was so crowded there wasn’t anywhere to go. Zero social distancing. I would compare it to cattle being led into the slaughter trucks. A fair description! TSA agents overwhelmed. My encounter bordered on ridiculous. Too long to explain. I would avoid this destination at all costs.,-1,CLT

Not once has the baggage claim carousel been accurately reported. You leave travelers guessing if their baggage is on carousel B1, B2 or both when you just say B. Then you have people bouncing back and forth between carousels because of your lack of detail. There is also no organization when it comes to shuttles back to parking. You have no lines or anyone directing people, so there is just a mass of people. It’s so disorganized, some people are being courteous while others don’t care and just walk to the front of the line.

Food: There is a lovely atrium food court with rocking chairs, if you can get one, and a nice array of restaurant styles. The restaurants had very long lines, so I stopped in a convenience shop and got a sandwich to avoid the lines. Dogs: They have airport comfort dogs, I was really hoping to see one. Unfortunately, I did not. Maybe next time. Staff: Everyone was helpful and friendly. One of the young men sanitizing surfaces was actually dancing and just made you smile. The shop cashier told me I can grab a free bag of chips since I got the sandwich and a bottle of water. The gate attendant cheerfully added a note to allow me to pre-board, as I cannot pivot and navigate a tight space easily and unbeknownst to those around me, it brings me great physical pain to have to pivot and dodge other people and their baggage. She did however, add a request for a wheelchair, which I did not request and it caused some confusion for the staff at the destination terminal. CONS - Seating: There are not enough accessible seats. I needed a place to eat my sandwich and the rocking chairs were full and all the atrium seats that I could find were bar stool type chairs that, due to my handicap, I am completely unable to get on and off. I get around ok with a cane. However, I also had to stand at the gate, as there was not enough seating.

The center core with concourses sticking out works well, the moving walkways are nice, and I explored all of the concourses as I was here for 4 hours. A, B, C, and D were nice, and the food options were excellent. Also, all of the staff were super nice and the facilities were clean.

I was transitioning through this airport on my way home and I sadly missed my flight. I had to make some important international calls to sort out a new ticket but their internet was spotty at best and I could hardly hold a conversation for for than a few seconds without it dropping and I certainly couldn't do video. I had to piggy back off of a store's network I found somewhere b/c theirs was so unreliable. There wasn't even a Boingo Hotspot there that I could buy and no SIM card vending machines, or any vending machines for that matter in the main terminal, which makes things even more frustrating when the entire airport shuts down at 9pm and becomes a ghost town. Forget about sleeping if you get stranded. There isn't a comfortable place in site and their rocking chairs (very dated now) is really one of the few non-airport style chairs they have available. For being the 16th largest city in the U.S. as the Governor says repeatedly every 5 minutes on the recorded message, it has a long way to go. Few restaurants are open too so expect very long lines at your favourite places to go. Lastly, the TSA agents here are the rudest I have experienced. They yelled at customers, they didn't smile, they didn't even try to have conversation with people when people tried to be nice to them. They all seemed very dissatisfied with their work.

The staff walked around more than cleaned the facility and two young workers tried to get into a confrontation with me for no reason. They were in front of me on the automatic belt and kept looking back talking about me but I paid them no attention because I couldn't hear what they were saying. The food lines were long and no social distancing. The bathrooms were not cleaned enough. I have a 6 hour layover in the airport and had to keep moving around to less crowed areas to feel safe. Some people weren't wearing masks and no one in authority corrected them just the automatic message that played out periodically over the intercom.,-1,CLT

In particular, I want to praise one woman who made my transition through Charlotte incredible. I don't know her name but, I got off my flight from Gainesville FL in the crowded end of E gates and had only a 1 hour layover, and made my way to my next departure in C 15 to Pittsburgh. I stopped to buy lunch and found that my wallet was missing. I quickly returned to E34 and begged the woman who was the gate agent to check the now empty jet, handed her my used boarding pass. She stopped what she was doing and walked through that door. I knew she wouldn't find it and began wondering how I would pay for my parking at PIT. A few minutes later, she emerged through that same door and handed me my wallet. It contained my credit and debit cards and my cash. All intact. I don't know her name but I told her she was my favorite person on Earth. The man seated nearby said ""you are one lucky guy"", and I agreed. I ran to C15 and made my flight.

They have so many people flocked at the end or this terminal that there are no seats. People are standing. The gates are so close. Like the door to the gate is maybe 2 feet from next gate. No organization at all. People were in line to speak with gate agent and she pretty much ignored us last two in line.

It gives me time to ponder the state of the US airline industry as a whole and some insight into how a thriving demand still results in oft dismal earnings.

It's over-crowded, lacks seating, constant tarmac delays waiting for gates to be available, and the departing airfares are at least $200 higher than similarly sized airports. AA has a monopoly (over 90% of all flights) and they clearly take advantage by price gouging and delivering horrible service with impunity.

Got to the gate 12 minutes before the scheduled departure only to have them already close it. They weren't apologetic in the least, worst customer service ever! Just shouted at us that we will have to rebook a later flight, it's not their problem, but feel free to make some purchases in their airport.

My incoming AA flight from LHR was forced to wait for the gate to be ready once we arrived, and then once at the gate, we had to wait again to de-plane because Customs (Immigration/CPB) was backed up. Once we reached customs, it took over an hour to get through due to long lines and literally one CPB Officer processing inbound US Citizens. Once we were past Baggage Claim and Baggage Re-Check, the transfer from Concourse D to Concourse E took a ridiculous amount of time as the ""Moving Sidewalks"" were non-oprational. Once we finanlly arrived in Concourse E, the food and drink options were horrible (Burger King and Panda Express? Seriously?) Then our connecting flight was delayed due to late arrival of inbound flight, again because of poor Ground Operations. Finally, once we boarded, we were delayed again due to taxiway congestion. This is the most poorly managed airport I have ever traveled through and I will never book another flight through this airport. The levels of mismanagement were far worse than even bad Third World airports. Avoid CLT at all costs. You're welcome.",-1,CLT

Never realized that late night flights, there are no amenities available. Really? Your flight is delayed, your stuck and on top of that the airport offers nothing! No food, no drinks, not even a vending machine? This airport is a poor example of an “international” airport. As with the airlines customer service is literally in the toilet.

The customs area is very compact, and it's a short walk from the gates to the passport checkpoint. With Global Entry and a Carry-On bag, I went from jetway through the entire process and through security back into the passenger terminal in 20 minutes. I don't think there's any other major hub where that's doable. The rest of the airport is decent. On the plus side, it's a decent size - not as massive as Atlanta, but big enough to be able to stretch your legs if you have time to kill. There's also a good selection of food and drink at the airport, though prices are high. On the other hand, American schedules a lot of short connections through the airport, so you may not have time to enjoy the amenities. And note that a lot of the gate areas are under construction, and they can get very crowded, so be prepared to stand for awhile. Overall, I much prefer Charlotte to Atlanta and a lot of the other hubs. But it's not quite elite yet.",1,CLT

However, we waited on the plane for an hour before being told we would be moved to a different plane. Once we walked back into the airport, we were then told that the flight was completely cancelled which lead to a mad dash to the one attendant at the desk to try to change flights. No announcement was ever made about vouchers, where to pick up luggage, etc. We have waited in this line for answers for 3 hours. We tried calling American Airlines representatives who told us just to speak with an attendant in person. Just recently we were told to go collect our luggage near baggage claim. Currently, two of our family members are waiting to receive our luggage from a woman who said “There are only 5 employees pulling bags out, the other 50-100 have already clocked out and gone home.” I would say horrible miscommunication if there had been much communication at all. All that was needed was an overhead announcement stating where to pick up bags, wait in line to rebook flights, will email vouchers, or something to that extent. Absolutely awful experience.",-1,CLT

Charlotte is at least 20 years behind other real category x airports. The following is a list of cons because there are no pros to this miserable airports. No Seating accommodations for passengers who are stranded overnight which happens frequently for the slightest amount of rain. Only one bathroom on the entire 2nd-floor ticketing level. One bathroom for thousands of people. They’re so smart they put the smoking section right on the curbside which permeates the entire airport. All of the lines for food or drink are always packed. It’s always hot. They turn off their escalators so you have to climb stairs with your luggage. TSA is incapable of properly staffing their checkpoints which create massive waits! This due to the mistreatment of employees. Extremely narrow walkways in the concourses and again limited restrooms. They built a new concourse in A terminal and didn’t have the presence of mind to put seating for people to eat their food. Always traffic outside due to the dumb physical layout of the airport.,-1,CLT
2019-06-16,0.2,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,needs to be some management improvement,False,"  There are so many problems with every aspect of this airport. I'm going to list problems with some no-cost or low-cost solutions. 1) Concourses are narrow, so pedestrian traffic is a mess. People are constantly bumping, almost bumping, crossing in front of, and getting behind slow people. Last night, a member of the cleaning crew had parked a rolling garbage bin in the middle of the concourse (E) and was off to the side having a casual conversation with a vendor. This caused many pedestrian issues, in an already stressful environment. Solution: train cleaning crews about traffic in the concourses and how to treat customers better and NOT block their paths. 2) Continual gate change for arrivals, and - what seems like - confusion for the airplane waiting to pull into the appropriate gate. I don't know how much larger airports are so organized, but CLT needs to have systems in place for parking planes quickly at their gates to get people to their connecting flights on time. Last night in Concourse E Gate 17 (6/13/2019), 5 breathless passengers showed up to catch the last flight to Columbia SC that day. The unconcerned gate employee told them the doors were closed, and there was nothing he could do. Their incoming flight had been blocked from their gate for a time, making them late to the Columbia flight and that flight pulled away without them. super simple, cheap solution: have a gate ready for each arriving plane. If a plane has passengers for connections, communicate with their connecting plane's crew to please wait 3-5 minutes for the passengers to arrive. 3) Some of the slide-walks weren't working, and you need that extra boost in speed to reach long distances between connections (see above). Solutions: maintain existing equipment and keep it running. 4) Lots of trash, lots of people working who seemed to not want to be there, and boarding queues crowding the already narrow corridors - there needs to be some management improvement at this airport. All of this makes me feel less safe flying.",-1,CLT

Airport is overcrowded with many rude employees that could care less about the traveling public. Many areas under construction with carpeted areas being difficult for travelers to move their bags.

I had to get my luggage (even though it was checked through to SFO). When I got down to luggage claim one of those sniffer dogs they have, a small beagle (could have still been in training and I am not faulting the dog at all) went crazy seeing my dogs. I got yelled at by it's handler over the concourse that I need to pick up my dogs? and what kind of service dogs these were. I responded politely that this is a question she was not allowed to ask and that I felt uncomfortable yelling my disability over the airport. Her rude response was that there were probably just emotional support dogs and needed to be carried by me that for sure they were not service dogs like hers. Well no as your dog is not a service dog! It is a working dog, which is supposed to stay calm under any circumstance. Finally got it all finagled and re-checked my bag when I got to the 2nd very rude and obviously bored customs agent who asked me for the paperwork on my dogs. I hand him all the paperwork with the Aphis paperwork (shot verification) laying on top and hs rudely asks where is the rabies paperwork? Right there under your darn nose. I do not see it.

Most inefficient security of AA hubs. 1 TSA precheck open on a Monday morning with no less than 30 minute wait. Staff is rude. At another check point asked if i could leave shoes on since TSA pre and was rudely told this is not a TSA checkpoint. Every major airport in the US allows for shoes to stay on (but electronics out) and allow walk through scanner when boarding pass marked. Not the inefficient rude people in Charlotte. Horribly under seated in their waiting areas. Never enough seats. Wall to wall standing people in aisles and halls. This airport should not be a hub. They have no concept of efficiency or courtesy!

I switched back to Delta. And they left me in Atlanta 3 weeks in a row on a Friday night so I gave up on them. So I went back to American where I was executive platinum but I had a strategy I would avoid the airport closest to my house (Charlotte) since they are delayed 90% of the time. Alas schedules get changed and unlike Delta, American will put you on another flight and invariably those go through Charlotte in the east coast. So I am departing on my 3rd flight via Charlotte this month. And it is delayed 1 hour. My other two were delayed 30 and 45 minutes. In all 3 cases the planes landed ahead of schedule and sat in the taxiway for 45, 35, and 37 minutes. I am baffled. No other airport I visit (85 in the last 12 months) has this issue. Maybe they don’t care like Delta for their diamonds or maybe they really are incompetent. But I would think there is a public safety risk if they are this incompetent. Should the FAA investigate? I don’t know but what I do know is I will do everything I can to go through DFW to avoid the inevitable missed flight yet again since Delta is no longer an option because they disdain their frequent flyers.",-1,CLT

I have never been in an airport that is so stressful upon arrival and departure. You have some of the meanest employees working outside. Travelers want to get loaded up and get in/out as fast as possible but they are rushed beyond a reasonable amount. Travelers were screamed at, berated, and essentially threatened by the staff outside. It's embarrassing to say that's my hometown airport. I can't imagine ever having that experience anywhere else and ever going back. It's uncalled for and unacceptable. Not to mention the fact that there isn't enough seating at the gates. We were forced to check a carryon at the entrance of the plane because ""they were out of room"". Then once we arrived at the baggage claim to get the bag we didn't want to have checked to begin with, we waited another 30 minutes on it to arrive! Then you go outside and continuously get screamed at to move to a certain location and they basically don't want any cars to stop. Almost as if they want you to load up with the car still moving and then get out as quickly as possible. It's just absurd. I wish I had video recorded the experience and had action 9 on it.

I have been the highest status on United, Delta and American in the past five years and am currently highest on Delta and American. Needless to say I travel a lot. I will book about 250000 miles this year. Mostly domestic wth 10 international trips. I will go to 80 airports a year in average. Sadly Charlotte is the closest airport to my home and is the worst airport I travel through (yes, this includes JFK and CDG). The worst part is the staff are genuinely nice and really try hard but the airport operations are a complete disaster. I have gone through Charlotte 31 times this year and have averaged a 35 minute taxi time. I have missed 14 flights this year trying to go through Charlotte. I have driven home 11 times (I am 80 miles away). Yes, there is perpetual. construction but LaGuardia is much worse there. It is simply they don’t know how to route planes on the ground. I am literally typing this as I am taxiing (45 minutes so far). I am baffled that LaGuardia and JFK figured out how to move aircraft in the ground but Charlotte can’t. Maybe the air traffic team at Charlotte should benchmark any other airport in the world (I mean this literally) to understand how to move aircraft on the ground. This task is clearly beyond their comprehension. This is frankly confusing in the home of Nascar! It is a shame too because the services on the airport are actually pretty good. Yes, if you have a regional you have to do the march across the world to the E but people are genuinely friendly as you walk so it isn’t that bad. So Charlotte. Figure out how to move airplanes on the ground and you could actually be a good airport. But until you do you are not worth the hassle.

2018-09-06,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,"i""ncompetence is staggering",True,"  Based on others' reviews, it is evident that the CLT site is fairly consistent in poor service, missed connections, and overall negative experiences. Our flight was delayed due to the President's visit and inclement weather. When we finally reached our gate after sitting on the tarmac for over an hour, we were delayed further due to a lack of staffing to park our aircraft. Once deplaned, we raced to our connection only to find the flight had closed (well outside of the 10-min window of departure time). The excuse provided for the lack of staffing at our arrival gate: lightning and staff safety. Yet, staff were evidently not in any danger to guide our departing flight out of the gate, a fact we found quite interesting. Many customers were left stranded and when trying to rebook flights, the responses from AA workers ranged from eye rolls to terse replies. Never did any employee of the airline or the airport acknowledge what every passenger was feeling. A simple, ""We understand you are upset and we are doing what we can to make the rest of your trip as pleasant as possible."" As we stood in a customer service line, one airline employee passed out customer service number tickets. When asked by several passengers where our luggage might be, she replied, ""Whatever flight you were supposed to be on, that's where your luggage is."" Many people informed her that our connections had already left before we arrived. Yet, she stuck with her (obviously incorrect) statement of next-flight luggage transport, absolutely clueless. We were able to rebook on a flight the next day (2 p.m.) but needed to find something earlier for work obligations. At 11:50 p.m. we left the main concourse, past the TSA area, and headed to the main ticketing counter. Unbeknownst to us (and hundreds others), TSA closes their gates at midnight. No signage, no verbal notice, no nothing. We were locked out of any food, beverages, seating, carpeting, etc. until the airport reopened at 4:30 a.m. We found a quiet place to sit (on the floor, with a locked door next to us) and charge our devices near the baggage carousel. Not long after settling in, an airport employee saunters up and says, ""You gone hafta move from that do'."" As we gather our things to move, the employee then says, ""I don't know why you so upset. You know you can't sit in front of that do'."" Our response: ""Because this airport is horrible."" His response: ""Ain't nobody tole you to come heah."" And this was the basic attitude of every single employee we encountered from our arrival until our eventual departure. We did attempt to make a purchase at the Starbucks at the ticket counter. True to CLT form, the oven was broken and they had run out of the one thing I cared to order. And passengers were due to arrive in less than 4 hours. To be served what remained to be seen. If the presence of a high-profile official and a brief storm delay can render this airport all but useless, an actual emergency will bring the entire city to its knees. There is clearly no plan to address the lack of airport personnel, availability of rental cars, hotel rooms, etc. and neither American Airlines nor the CLT airport gave any effort whatsoever to aid passengers in navigating such a challenging experience. I am committed to avoiding CLT at all costs. The level of incompetence is staggering. Since the airport is owned and operated by the City of Charlotte, I can only imagine what disasters occur throughout the city on a daily basis.",-1,CLT

The staff were not prepared to handle the number of stranded customers and the service was horrible. Also, there were no rental cars available and the car rental staff were rude and of no help. We decided to call a friend and stay in Gastonia, NC which is 20 minutes from the airport and we rented a car outside of the airport in Gastonia and drove 3 hours the next day home to Johnson City in order to attend a funeral. The airlines (American) cancelled all flights and American nor the Charlotte airport staff could handle the influx of customers. My main concern for Charlotte is to prepare your staff for a disaster and how to handle a crisis when there is an influx of people in your airport. I would expect that your facility has a disaster plan and if this is your disaster plan, it needs to be revamped so that you can meet the customer needs. Very concerned on how this went down!",-1,CLT

I have used the airport approximately 7-8 times in the past year and there is always an insane delay with the luggage.

I'm not sure if it was American Airlines or just the lack of organization by the airport. We landed with a 90 minute layover from Cancun. Lightening was spotted so we were told we had to wait before they could let anyone off of our first plane. We missed our connecting flight somehow even though we made it to the gate before departure time. Nobody was helpful or seemed to care that we were upset and lost on what to do next. They said we had to stay in a room until the next morning and that's all there was to it. No ""I'm sorry"" or anything of the sort. Our luggage was supposedly sent to Indy without us, but when we got to Indy 7 hours later to pick it up, it was nowhere to be found. Our luggage was left in Charlotte last year as well.

That being said this is the least organized airport I have ever had the displeasure of visiting. We flew in from Jamaica for a connecting flight. First we were forced to stay on the airplane for an extra 35 minutes because customs was clogged. Mind you we already had a terrible flight experience with American Airlines. Upon entering customs we observe chaos. Different TSA employees are yelling at hundreds of customers to “direct” us all. After finally getting through customs we are yelled at to get our bags, fine. At the third threshold however three more TSA agents start giving everyone three different varieties of wrong directions. We end up missing our connecting flight and at the wrong area completely. More employees continue to curtly tell us we are all in the wrong area (although we had been yelled at to do so) and that we are SOL. We and another hundred customers then waited an additional 40 minutes to recheck in and get new flights. We did not come across one decent treating polite employee during this entire experience. I wish my job allowed me to be rude and discourteous to good paying customers.

I was arriving on an American flight that was more than an hour late. When we touched down in Charlotte it seemed like there might just be time for me to make my connecting flight. However, after taxiing a few minutes, we came to a stop near the terminal and then sat there without moving for a solid hour. The pilot apparently couldn't tell us anything beyond ""there's a traffic jam"", which was not exactly helpful. There were lots of gates open, including the one I watched my connecting flight leave, so I can't really believe there was a valid reason for such a ridiculous delay.",-1,CLT

Although there has been construction going on at the airport for at least the last 18 months, it has not been an issue. There are plenty of signs and helpful employees to direct flyers where to go. I am especially impressed that there are workers and signs in the long term parking lots that direct drivers where to find parking spots. This was especially critical during the busy time before and after Christmas. And I have never waited more than a few minutes for the shuttle bus to pick up in the parking lot or in arrivals. Previously I have flown in and out of Chicago Ohare, ORD, and CLT is so much easier to move through than ORD, which is massive in comparison. I also find that airport staff will treat you well if you treat them well.",1,CLT
2017-12-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,security lines insanely long,False," This airport is a complete fiasco. I have lived in Charlotte all my life and I am very familiar with the airport, but with all the construction going on at CLT there have been more issues I have encountered, mostly associated with parking, but this was probably was the worst out of all of them. I was flying American Airlines from Charlotte to Pittsburgh to see friends and normally I use Park N' Go but this time I decided I'd park in the Daily Decks since it was closer to the terminal I was only going for 3 days, I always avoid the Long Term lots since those lots are a zoo and they have been that way forever. When I parked the first shuttle was full so I waited almost 20 minutes for another one to come and when it came the driver offered no help to anyone with large suitcases. In the airport the line at check in was ridiculous, the agents were taking their sweet time checking people in, American app was not working so I couldn't check in with it. Check-in took about 25 minutes, security lines were insanely long and I finally ended up going to the E checkpoint even though my flight was at Concourse C since it was the least of all of evils but even then TSA still took almost an hour. TSA Staff were all very rude and were barking orders at people military style, I put my laptop in the plastic bin with my wallet, phone, and shoes like I have countless times before without a problem and the TSA agent barked at me claiming I wasn't following directions and that my laptop had to go in it's own container, I looked on TSA.gov and nowhere does it say that's required, all it says is you have to remove the laptop from your carry on, which I did. Of course since I knew they were just doing their job I didn't argue. I go through the scanner and wait for my bags and I couldn't find my backpack, I ask one of the agents and she flat out ignored me and said I was asking the wrong person. I finally saw them staring at my bag on the screen and I stood there until finally after 15 minutes an agent asked ""is this your bag"" and I said yes. As it turned out a set of souvenir coins that had formed a clump in my backpack apparently looked weird but when I asked if I could just take it out and show them what it was they yelled at me saying I wasn't allowed to touch the bag and I'd be denied boarding if I did. Nobody was willing to help, they were treating all the passengers like dogs, even children and the elderly, it was just appalling. There's a large amount of restaurants and retail outlets at CLT but once you're at the gate the seating areas are cramped and there is very limited seating. The concourses have hardly changed at all since the late 90s. Some of the gates in Concourse E still use ancient dot matrix printers. After the TSA incident I just barely made my flight by 15 minutes even though I arrived at the airport almost 2 hours prior, gate agent was the only nice person I encountered at the airport, she probably heard of the all the TSA problems from other passengers because when she scanned my ticket she said ""don't worry I wouldn't have closed the door on you"" she said there were 12 people on the flight still stuck in the TSA lines.

I have not flown a lot in my life but when I do I usually have 18+ hour journeys. As a citizen of the United States, it is nice to come back after a few years. Well, after an eight hour flight over the ocean, the first thing you are met with is passport control. I have to say that the TSA, guards and police who work there are some of the most unhappy, unhelpful, and rude people I have ever had the mispleasure of interacting with. There were many lines and unclear, sometimes conflicting instructions. We were met with a man who did nothing but treat everyone like an animal, yelling and being rude to people who were confused. Even after the handful of times I have flown, flying and airports are still daunting and I feel sorry for the people who are first time flyers or tourists who will be met with this the first time they are in the country. In May, when I arrived with my boyfriend from a European country, we were met with hostility. When attempting to go through the line, they asked if we were family, if we were from the same household, which we were. The woman simply barked at us that we were indeed not together or family before we could even say anything. She then told her colleague to not help us because we were trying to get through the line faster. We were separated, he needed to be pulled to another line and I was forced to wait at least an hour on the other side. Needless to say we missed our next flight. I've never been so poorly treated in my life. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I understand they have an important job to do but there is no excuse for being so hateful and so rude to people, most of which are confused or afraid. We were almost in tears by the time the process was over. This airport was a stark contrast to the previous in London which was quick, painless and effective. Charlotte Douglas is anything but. On a brighter note, after we got through security, we talked to a woman to rebook our flight and she was very nice and very helpful. The security process is so long, so uncomfortable and the people are so rude I couldn't possibly recommend this place. I hope I never have to arrive in that airport again.

We had a 2.5-hour layover for a connecting flight to New Orleans. We have made round trips from the US to Italy for 35 years, and we have never had such a long delay in passing through US Immigration. There were at least 500 people in line, and there were only 7 agents checking passports. There were about 20 passport kiosks for do-it-yourself scan of passport, finger prints, etc. After about an hour, we made it to the Kiosk; then about another 45 minutes to the agent who repeated the same procedure himself that we had already done at the kiosk. The process couldn't have been more confusing and when I finally said something to an airport courtesy worker, she said ""we make no promises"". We barely made our connecting flight. They were closing the door. Many in line were for more than one hour after their connecting flights were due to depart. In short, avoid this airport until changes are made.

You generally always have to go from one end of one terminal to the end of another. Handicapped individuals used to reliably depend on the Club Car to pick them up and take them to their destination. You sat in a designated spot and they would pick you up. However, now probably for some politically correct reason, the Club Cars no longer run. They have been replaced by men and women who will push you in a chair to where you are going. However, the sit and wait in the designated chairs no longer works. I sat for 25 minutes and watched empty chair after empty chair walk by me. Some looked at me, but just walked on by. If the airport was bad before [high priced restaurants and ling distances to walk with intermittent functioning if the skywalks] it is now even crueler.",-1,CLT

At least in Terminals B and E, there is a lack of available seating coupled with a lack of places to charge electronic devices/work while waiting for your next flight. At 9 am, I am currently sitting on the floor between terminals. The bathrooms are also showing their age and the smells are not inviting. The bathroom attendant helps but the problems in the bathrooms go much deeper than an attendant can solve. The carpets in the terminal should be ripped up and replaced with tile or a hard surface.

I attempted to exit the plane not being able to bend my leg, hobbled to the door in the rain to finally get the help! When the person got me to my gate he said Sorry, you missed the flight. I got an apology and was told that they apologized for being short staffed and received a discount voucher for a hotel, I asked for management and again was told about them being short staffed. By the time I got shuttled to the room I should have already been with my son in Kansas. I missed a night with him, had to pay for a room because of them being ""short staffed"" and was placed outside in the wheelchair in the freezing cold and rain! I was told that I needed to be outside so I didn't miss my shuttle! 45 minutes is how long it took! By the time I reached the room, my luggage was soaked, I hobbled to a vending machine because I was starving, showered, and got to sleep at 2am I had to be back up at 5, take a shuttle at 5.30, and be back at the airport by six. In fear of being short staffed again although the plane was scheduled to depart at 7.30am.

Some of the problems are not exactly with the airport itself. Traffic from where I live to and from the airport is bad almost all the time.

Honestly, I fly out of CLT very often, as it is frequently the airport where I am forced to take my connecting flight. I say forced, because the staff are absolutely awful. The food service and cleaning personnel are the kindest people I have met, however the check in attendants are the most entitled staff I have ever dealt with. Each and every time I go here (4 times in the past 2 months), the customer service provided is absolutely awful, not taking the customer into consideration whatsoever. I was asked to check my bag, and when I questioned why (as the bag could clearly fit beneath the seat in front of me), the man says to me ""because she said so."" And had no sort of explanation to follow. Of course when I finally boarded there was enough room for my bag in more than a few overhead bins. I do not recommend this airport at all. The only reason I do is for the kindness I have received from every food service or cleaning crew member, once I thought I lost my phone in the bathroom and the woman in there cleaning was so willing and so kind enough to help me find it. I think this airport's staff need an update on how important customer service is to any business.",-1,CLT

I had requested a wheelchair when booked returning flight. None were available, Agent at desk said they would call for one but it would be several minutes. After a 5 hour night flight from San Francisco, I needed to use the bathroom immediately. Had to walk a distance, without wheelchair, to closest one where I found one with 2 working sinks out of 4. No wheelchair or staff was in sight until food court area. (At the airports in Maui and San Francisco there was always staff available to assist you). Finally found a unused wheelchair (no staff). We then traveled to Baggage Claim area. We needed an elevator to go to lower level. Poor signage of where the elevator was. (sign was on the side wall, none in direst view). At passing the security check point, the entry security line was backed up to the escalator. I am sure many were upset and worried about not getting to their gate on time. Once retrieving our luggage, still seated in a wheelchair, I had to wait for my husband to get our parked car (green lot). While waiting outside, the cars, buses and airport cleaning truck exhaust became overwhelming. I could not breathe and began a coughing fit. With a new proposed airport building, I hope the administration look into these problems and finds a solution to these many problems.",-1,CMH

Always enjoy how easy it is to get in and out, as I park in the garage that allows direct access via an underground walkway. It's seldom crowded, though I've had the occasional long wait to get through security. I will echo another reviewer's comments about the rudeness of some TSA agents. The young lady helping us load our trays with our personal items, shoes, etc. on our most recent trip was actually quite pleasant. However, some male agents on the other side of the x-ray machines were harsh and disrespectful to travelers (including myself). One in particular seemed super disgruntled, and lacked basic communication skills to boot. Unfortunate, given the customer-facing nature of his job. On a previous trip, I can also attest to the fact that my wife underwent a pretty intense pat down because she was carrying baby formula through security with our child...maybe this is typical protocol nowadays but I think she was surprised by an agent searching inside the underwire of her bra (something we hadn't seen/experienced when traveling with our first child). Food options, as others have stated, are pretty weak. There is Starbucks available, if you have the time to wait in line a while during peak hours. Overall, I think it's great for flying in/out of my hometown, but probably not much to get excited about for someone passing through.",1,CMH

I am a pre-check customer and they found sea salt scrub in my carry on and took me aside to test it. I made it and I could have and offered to eat it. They told me no and then proceeded to take all of my belongings that I had already picked up including my purse, my shoes and cell phone. I find this practice illegal and highly invasive. I had done nothing wrong and because you're incompetent staff was not able to read an explosive test properly (had to call someone to walk him through it), then they inconvenienced me by taking my things and treating me inhumane. For my next flight, I'm driving to Denver. It's cheaper too even with having to pay for parking. Also, when you randomly select people to test their shoes through pre-check, that practice sucks too!

My satisfaction has been slowly declining over the past year. Two things that stand out during this trip are: 1) The line for pre-check was reconfigured recently to make passengers take an unnecessarily long walk in a circle to get to TSA. When multiple passengers did the logical thing and just ducked under the rope, they were scolded by TSA and the TSA agent said ""We wish they would reconfigure it too, but you can't duck under"". It should not be that hard for airport staff to occasionally check and reconfigure the line to accommodate the current volume of passengers. 2) The only quality food option in concourse B has been Outback, but their quality of service has been declining over the past year as well.",1,CVG

However, I have arrived at this airport twice in the past three weeks and an extremely aggravating problem has developed. Once you arrive at baggage claim, wait times to receive your checked luggage are ridiculously long. Today, I only had to wait 45 minutes and felt lucky because 3 weeks ago I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to get my bag. In both cases luggage from a dozen or so flights were being delivered to a single carousel around which several hundred very annoyed passengers were milling. There were typically gaps of 5 to over 10 minutes between arrival of new ""flights"" of luggage. I am not sure if this is a staffing problem, incompetence, or negligence, but if this trend continues I would recommend flying in and out of Dayton.",-1,CVG

I actually witnessed a family who did not make their flight (one prior to mine but same gate) and persisted by raising their voices that the gate agent should have known they were there but because TSA took so much time, they were late. The truth later came out that they were ONLY in line for one hour, on a holiday weekend. That is exceptional but poor timing on their part. Everyone in the aviation world knows that on a holiday weekend, there is a 2.5-3 hour minimum time preparation period to make your flight. So a free plug for DLF, consider this!! Saying all of this, not only was TSA awesome in their timeliness, but the gate agents kept their cool and handled the situation with excellence.",1,DAL

Upon checking in, the tsa people in the front were extremely rude and talked to me like I knew how their machines work because apparently I was standing in the wrong area. They told me to go to counter 5 and the lady at counter 3 yelled at me for not being in her line. They walked around yelling at people standing in line directing them elsewhere even though they told us to stand where we were. There were limited seating once you got in through the screening. The center of the airport was packed and there was no seating when i got lunch. Some of the outlets had no power so you could not charge devices. My flight was delayed due to the tech outage and the lady at the counter was extremely rude if you had asked her any questions. I understand that they can have a bad day but every employee I interacted with either seemed like they did not want to answer my question or just looked like they did not want to he here.

The terminal is bright, spacious and with plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Going through security was a breeze with TSA-Pre. The Airport WIFI is easy to connect too and fast. The major drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. The bathrooms are small and there are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms.

My arrival was at 8p. The airport was desolate and I discovered I could not be picked up at baggage claim, or even at the entrance where I was dropped off. No signage. My Uber driver told me. No signage or employee to alert passengers they had to go back into the airport, walk all the way back past check-in, up an unmarked escalator, then to the right and down an unmarked endless and not working sky walk to an unmarked elevator to a random spot in parking lot B. They say 10 minutes. MAYBE... if you're an athlete and know where you're going. I literally pushed a stranded and scared woman in a wheelchair.

The lines were slow as TSA repeatedly argued with airport employees trying to assist people in wheelchairs through the checkpoints. TSA were sarcastic responding to any questions. Supervisor refused to arrive for 45 minutes to assist me because I had my wallet stolen and needed to use alternate ID. A supervisor never came and i had to reactivate my Clear membership to get through. $189 because none of the herds of TSA employees standing around joking about passengers could do the ID confirmation process. As I result, I got to watch TSA ignore, belittle, and joke about harassing passengers. Absolute garbage, especially with disabled passengers and elderly passengers. I was shocked to watch them make clearly disabled passengers try to stand and walk. One lady, in particular, was confused and crying. Ruthless TSA. Shocking.",-1,DAL

That’s right, no one in the airport has it, all stores sold out. You would think proper planning would be a high priority for this outbreak but it’s not at Love Field. Also no staff has deemed it priority to give a tutorial of manners for coughing and sneezing.

Everyone I talked to going there said I would love the airport but that was not the case. 1) Too crowded 2) Too few restaurants 3) No lounges to escape to not even a USO.

It's above average for American airports, for sure, in terms of its accessibility, signage, speed of security (especially for TSA Pre-Check holders), cleanliness, modernity, and spaciousness considering the small size of the airport. The dining and shopping options are more than ample for a small airport, although nothing particularly, uniquely Dallas or Texas, in my opinion. Restrooms and seating are clean, USB chargers are ample. My only complaint is that the Southwest personnel here, from check-in to baggage handling to the gate, are usually on the grumpy side - enough to bring this airport from an 8/10 to a 6/10.

From the boarding areas, there are views of the airfield and parking apron. Seating is plenty though at busier times there can be a dearth of seating. Food options are limited given the size of the terminal. To order food, the iPads which contained flight info, links to newspapers and magazines have been eliminated. U now have to us a QR code to scan the menu from your phone. WiFi service is excellent. Easy to connect and fast. There was barely a wait to go through security with TSA-Pre.

Its a very busy airport with Southwest, Frontier and Air Canada all operating from this terminal. There are great views of the airfield from the boarding area. There is plenty of seating however at peak times, there can be a dearth of seating. One of the new innovations is the dining area where orders are taken on iPads which have flight info and links to several newspapers and magazines as well as online games. WiFi service is very good and fast. Limited number of shops given size constraints of this terminal. The only thing I wish this terminal had is an airport lounge.

Since it is based on the oldest terminal of the airport, it has an intimate feel in the check-in areas. I traveled with Air Canada, and in the morning I traveled there were no lines at any airline desk. TSA was smooth, with barely any passengers passing through the checkpoint. The boarding area is nice with a good number of shops, and there are many iPads throughout the terminal, which shows the airport’s effort to keep up with airport across the country in modernizing. For Air Canada from the DC area to Toronto, I think that DCA is the best airport to go through out of the three airports in the area.",1,DCA

2024-08-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,2.0,Horrible for traveling with disabilities,True,"   Horrible for traveling with disabilities. We had purchased a ticket requiring wheelchair assistance. Upon arrival, we had to wait for assistance, it was not there despite the flight arriving late. A buggy arrived that could not take us to the required terminal. The supervisor was helpful and called for someone, telling us to wait. No one came after 10-16 min. We found out that despite being told to wait, my mom’s name was not on the list of passengers requiring assistance. We then spoke with attendants at the nearby gate. They frantically texted and called as the boarding time for our next flight was looming. Finally someone arrived and stated that she was unable to take us as her shift would end past the time since the terminal was so far away. Fortunately 2 more assistants had arrived with her with wheelchairs (3 people requested assistance). One of them offered to take us. The other guy with the wheelchair left (presumably thinking that we were the only ones needing assistance), so the remaining passengers did not have the help they needed either. The porter that took us to the gate was wonderful, a man from Ethiopia. He ran with my mother in the wheelchair. I had to take the moving sidewalks to keep up with him. We arrived at the gate right as the next flight was boarding. It was extremely stressful. It took over and hour of waiting for assistance, and we narrowly made our connection. I would avoid booking a layover in this airport in the future, unfortunately we’re traveling through again on the way back. Hopefully our experience will be better but I have my doubts.",-1,DEN

Avoid this airport for business travel unless you don't need to pay employees for travel time (if you do, then pay the bribe to the TSA for pre-check, you'll save money). Arrive two hours ahead of boarding time if you have a rental car. Security has been a complete disaster for years and has only gotten worse. The line now greets you on the sidewalk outside. Once you get through security, you'll need to fight your way through the mob trying to board the trains and continually preventing the train doors from closing (no TSA Pre will save you here). Congratulations, you made it to your terminal where you must now navigate the miles long slalom course of random kiosks, broken conveyors, food lines, other desperate travelers etc. So that you can stand in the next line at customer service, when you inevitably miss your flight, where an airline employee will complain about the airport with you while rebooking you on a later flight. Then sit down, have a coffee and spend the time waiting for your next flight to go post angry reviews that no one will ever read. Denver is not an airport, it is an elaborate scheme to trap you in their building and sell you garbage you wouldn't need if they could actually get you to your airplane, like a normal airport. Seriously, I'd rather fly through Newark, at least they're honest about how poor they are.",-1,DEN

I have been spoiled by the airports in Minneapolis and even Albuquerque. Flew out of LaGuardia in NY, which was pretty fabulous in every way.

There is absolutely no point for TSA precheck to take 30 min when there is no line. The general security line was 20 min faster than precheck. The TSA agents are so slow and rude, it’s not like any other airport I’ve ever visited. They made me walk through the scanner 6x, then take off my shoes, then my shawl, then the decided it was a good idea to have me go through the X scanner. This place makes me so angry every time I visit. I saw them swabbing a woman’s leg cast for explosives.

On departure after the bag drop we joined the security queue which snaked all the way around the airport - we had to walk all the way round after finding out at the start of the queue that it was the right Q !

Half the elevators we encountered were out of order. Others were blocked by construction. There is so much disruption due to ""construction"" but even on a weekday there seemed to be no hurry to complete the job - no workers in sight. Few restaurants in the main terminal area and those had little or no seating. Outside the restaurants there was even less seating. The arrival sign at the international arrival didn't work. Signs to TSA screening were confusing and misleading, though TSA itself seemed to be efficient. Internal security is a joke - there are few if any visible security officers. When I did find two Denver officers and tried to make them aware of an unattended bag they just grunted and waddled off. Perhaps worst of all, vehicle theft in airport parking is a serious problem and again, there doesn't seem to be any Denver police presence.",-1,DEN

2023-07-31,0.3,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,by far the worst airport,True,"  I fly frequently for both work and personal travel. Across my personal experience, having gone to many different airports DEN is by far the worst airport. I live in Colorado and it is my main and only location to fly in/out of. There are several reasons I rate DEN this way (1) poor signage to find tram/gate/TSA lines - I always need to coach friends and family who are visiting to both enter and exit the airport. They still inevitably get lost. I even still get lost from time to time! (2) Incredibly long wait lines for TSA entry. I have bio clear and TSA pre check. In all my experiences there has always been a long line and it takes at least 30 minutes to get through. This is on a good day. (3) They have sensitive TSA security machines compared to other airports - my luggage is ocassionally pulled for checking and it never happens at other airports. Like I said, I fly frequently and know what and how to pack to get through fast. Things still get triggered and every time they check my bag they find nothing wrong. (4) Disgusting bathrooms with poor design and cleanliness. No room to keep luggage with you in the stall and everything looks and smells dirty. Please take a note from MSP airport - build in luggage cubbies, make sure stall doors don't have huge gaps, and keep some consistent cleaning schedule. (5) Tram setup and dependence. Gates are all far away and you are essentially dependant on taking trams to get anywhere as it's challenging to walk and navigate. (6) Tram capacity levels are low. In the last 24 hours, I had to wait for the 4th Tram to go through before I could find even slight room to get on. I'm not a large woman - average athletic build - and there was no way for people to fit on the prior three trams as passengers were packed shoulder to shoulder and couldn't move to slightly allow others on. A large group of us started to build up at the tram stop at midnight because there was zero room. Not a great experience when you just want to get home. We tried to walk back but an airport employee told us to just use the tram because construction won't allow us to connect to ride pickup area. (7) Poor restaurant options and quality. Food quality and prices are just bad. Again, comparing to other airports you have both your fast food and sit down areas. We don't go in with high hopes for eating, but we have consistently bad food at sit down restaurants in the airport - fast food is what you would expect in terms of quality. (8) Departure exit escalators are limiting. If you take the tram to the airport departure gates, you are forced to take one of total 4 small escalators to get to the level that brings you to shuttles/ luggage pick up/etc. These escalators always have long lines because there is no other way to get to the departure level without going up the escalators or separate staircase - which is challenging with heavy suitcases. Comments are perpetually made about this poor design and one would think there is a fire hazard risk (this is not my area of expertise so who knows). It's just a miserable experience going from line to get on tram, line to get off tram, and line to get on shuttles. (9) Comfort does not exist. I am typically in the United Hub and ocassionally use the United pass, but regardless of how you choose to wait for your flight, you will be sitting in an area that likely isn't temperature controlled, doesn't have enough seats for full flights and is lacking in outlet plugs. I don't recommend this airport.",-1,DEN

Security is a nightmare, unorganized, lines backed up due to not enough gates open, staff are rude and slow. If you plan on getting through DIA better plan for at least 4 hours. This morning the regular lines were backed up, yet TSA pre check area empty and the Security agent said pay 85.00 and you can get through this. Is that the point? To start forcing everyone to pay for pre check? Why not open this line and get past the back log. I have metal in my body so need to go through the body scanner, yet it wasn’t available for the regular checks forcing me to go all the way to the x-ray and have to be escorted over to the other machine.

I've had the misfortune to have Denver as my home airport for several years now, and it is grossly inefficient, poorly designed, ugly, and difficult to get around. The employees at this airport act as if they either do not care about their jobs AT ALL or yell at travelers as if to make full use of the small amount of power they have. Security lines here are also beyond ridiculous, with lines frequently running out of the main security hall and down the hallway. It is the only airport that I have ever had to wait over an hour for security at, and this has happened five or more times. I am even a Clear member, and have had to wait over half an hour in that line multiple times as well. The airport has also been undergoing seemingly endless renovations for years now and each time I return it looks even further from being finished. The walking time to gates is absurdly long, with some gates taking as much as 20 minutes to reach from the main terminal areas. The decent wifi is really the only positive thing I have to say about this place. Again, I travel internationally throughout the year and have seen many airports, none of which are as inefficient and unhelpful as Denver. I am not typically one to write reviews, but I am fed up with this airport and feel a need to warn others of the frustration and waiting that they will inevitably encounter at DEN.",-1,DEN

One person showed up. When we finally got to where we're supposed to be at, we were in the wrong place. When we finally found out where we're supposed to go, they started working with us. When the guy noticed where I have to go. He was not happy, that he had to basically go across the whole entire terminal. He was very slow, he was complaining but he got me where I needed to go so I can fly out. That was a solo part. I flew back two days later with my husband. And we were both handicap assistant that we needed. My husband is low vision and he has to walk with a cane, I am also hearing impaired so a lot of noise can get very confusing to me. When we arrived the man at the counter helped us told us where we need to go. Another man showed up with my name on a piece of paper and a wheelchair. My husband told me to get in the wheelchair. He'll just travel behind him. Once that man found out where we had to go all the way across the terminal again, he was complaining. To the point where he kept saying I don't work and that area I only work in terminal areas. Can you walk? He kept getting a little louder and ruder. I was trying to figure out what he was saying after a while him complaining cuz he kept getting closer to my head what he was saying and I finally said you know what I'll get up. I'll walk, and when I got up I quickly got dizzy and realized. Nope, I got to sit. And he still kept complaining that this is not his type of job. Once I asked my husband. Can you please explain to him what's going on? I'm having a hard time understanding him, that's when he shut up. I live here in Colorado. I am ashamed that this is our airport. Airport. Disturbing, disgusting and horrible. I would never recommend anybody to fly into DIA. You need to train your employees to shut up. Be respectful and if they don't like their job quit their job and go to another one.

The construction has been going on for years and they’re not even fixing that part! They’re just moving security up a level - it’s dirty, I mean filthy, bathrooms are atrocious! Security lines are unacceptable, I’m talking winding all the way outside! The train is the ONLY way to get to the terminals. The little train they fills up instantly and you have to wait train after train until you can get on! Then when the train breaks down, you miss your flight. That’s it.

Much of it is because the TSA are unable to figure out the resources needed to allow passengers to get through without having to stand in line for 2 hours or more. All of the airport management and staff should be utterly ashamed of yourselves. Also, who designed your airport, an insane madman? A clown chimpanzee could do better. Up an escalator only to go down another escalator and then walk all the way around the airport back almost to where we entered to find where the security line starts. Couldn’t someone have directed us to the beginning of the security line? I had to leave litter because no one thought to leave trash bins anywhere or provide cups of water to people passing out in line. How many people have stood in line only to miss their flight. How many people has all this saved over 20 years? You wouldn’t even let me have a drink of water after getting though security parched. You took it off me before I could have a drink. How in God’s name does that help? Oh and can’t you figure out a way to test an old man’s belt without having to take it off and have his trousers fall down in front of everyone. Where is your sense dummies? I am 62 and I can see no alternative but to say I am disabled in order to get assistance and avoid standing in a TSA line that winds all the way around your horrible airport.

The security lines get longer and slower, the A Line to the airport is less predictable, and the staff are negligent. It's been under construction for over half a decade with no end in sight. Every flight I've taken in the past three years has been canceled or delayed. I wish there were at least a few positive things to say about the airport but I honestly can't think of any. It's poorly run, poorly staffed, and is always disorganized. The City of Denver or some other authority should get involved to replace DIA's leadership. DIA is an embarrassment to Denver and the state of Colorado.",-1,DEN

You’ll need at least three hours to get to your plane. Last time we flew out, even the clear and TSA lines are too long. It took me over 45 minutes to get through TSA. Then the trains were packed. On our way out, we had to wait for a 3rd train. On our way home, the train was down for 7 minutes which backed everything up. The platform was so crowded, people coming down the escalators had no where to go. So dangerous. Each train that stopped was already so full, only three or four people could squeeze in to each train car. Avoid this airport at all costs.",-1,DEN

It was so crowded and nowhere did the gate number indicate a different level and then board the train. They need to have much better ways of directing one to their gate. Clearly I am not alone in my opinion of this airport. Other airport are large without being chaotic, this one doesn’t cut it. Will avoid Denver in all future flights!",-1,DEN

Since I travel so much I have tsa precheck and clear. I have no idea how anyone would travel out of here with only one or neither because they are always so short staffed. The security is like a bottleneck causing many passengers to run through the airport and miss flights. Regardless of the day or time the security is always running on a crabby skeleton crew with less than half of the lines open even at north security. They just added a ton of gates in the C terminal so there are even more passengers waiting at security. The new part of the C terminal is nice but there are no restaurants yet. The older part of the airport is definitely run down and dirty with few restaurant options. Everything else would be tolerable if they would just invest in improving the security checkpoints.,-1,DEN

2022-06-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,absolute worst designed airport,True,"  This has got to be the absolute worst designed airport I have ever been in and Ive traveled all over the United States as well as Europe. Never have I been so confused as to the layout and how to find anything. You have signs with arrows going every direction saying all Gates and then north security, south security, arrows going up down left right East terminal etc none of the signage is clear or obvious. I had to ask a security person who was equally unclear and vague and could hardly speak english. After going through the 85 minute long security line which started all the way at the beginning of baggage claim, wrapped around all baggage claim areas ( blocking people) into another area where you had to walk past the skinny little dividing wall with barely enough room for people to roll their carry-ons, people trying to get their luggage had to cut through the line. The serpentine line literally filled up the entire floor of the bottom portion of the airport. Once you got dumped out after walking through the screening machine they were yelling at you to get out of the way get out of the way while you're trying to put your shoes on your jacket on get your purse etc. And then there was no arrow no clear direction which way to go where to go it was the skinniest narrow pathway having to step over fans and obstacles all in the way to go into an area that's not obvious what that area is. Having never been to this airport before I was unaware of the passenger trains that take you from terminal to terminal. Once I realized that was the deal I figured that out. The lights were out on some of the gate signage signs so it wasn't clear which direction to go once I was dumped out at the appropriate terminal. And to make matters worse as I stood in line to board the airplane for Southwest the signage at the front telling you which row and which boarding group you were in was broken it kept flip-flopping back and forth so nobody had a clue which line they were to stand in or whose turn it was to get in line. Once on the plane I thought was home free but no the pilot seemed to be lost when he was on the tarmac he went all the way to one runway then did a u-turn and it seemed as if we were going in circles maybe there was a change in the wind direction and that was necessary but seems sort of odd that you wouldn't know which way to go.",-1,DEN

Went to eat at the sandwich/ice cream shop by gate B54 on the United B concourse and we saw one of the employees prepping food with her disposable gloves on, the problem was she was touching her mouth eating food while prepping the food. This is a serious health violation. I was shocked! I asked to talk to the manager, in which I did, but he didn’t seem to concerned! Very disgusting! After seeing that we decided to go eat somewhere nicer. So we chose Elways. The food wasn’t bad but the problem was the lady bussing the tables, thought it was ok to use the same bar towel for multiple tables and if that wasn’t bad enough, she was wiping the seats off before wiping the tables!

The gate where my first flight was dropped off (in the B80s) looked straight out of the 1920s. No monitors to check, musty and smelly, barely any space to move. I had to walk to about B40 to see a monitor to check my connecting flight. Even in the ""nicer"" parts of the airport, there is absolutely no space. Tiny hallways with excessive crowding. It is near impossible to get through with so many people going in different directions. Good luck finding a table to eat at, or anywhere to sit for that matter. The bathrooms everywhere are absolutely atrocious. Stalls with no locks, doors don't shut, poop and toilet paper everywhere, empty toilet paper rolls and empty paper towel dispensers. Every time I went into a restroom there was someone in there ""cleaning"" it, but toilet paper and paper towels continued to be empty and I never saw them actually clean or sanitize anything.",-1,DEN

2022-05-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,,,,,Total chaos and incompetence,True,"  I hate incompetence, always have. I try not to complain but this experience was too much. I returned from London through Denver International Airport (DIA) - one of the most modern airports in the USA. Total chaos and incompetence. This was my 4th international arrival this year but my very first ever at DIA. I pity passengers having to deal with this mess in the future. It was horrible; a mess of chaos, poor design, and execution. If this is a preview of summer travel, God help the travelers. We landed on a United flight from London Heathrow. United scheduled my connecting flight for about 90 minutes, which should have been enough time to make the connection. We even landed early. The trouble started shortly after leaving the plane. There were two escalators going to the next level. At the top of the escalator everyone was funneled into a small doorway (wide enough for two people) in a very small area leading into a massive corridor. There was a logjam at the top of the escalators; people could not move forward but the escalator kept bringing people up. I had one foot of space between the escalator and the person ahead of me. I was pushed into the back of the person ahead of me, quite forcibly by the guy behind me. Pretty soon more passengers were banging into others, some ladies fell, and other passengers tried to keep new arrivals from falling. Very dangerous, unnecessary safety breach. We made it through the doorway to be in a corridor with probably well over 1,000 people milling about. (I later learned that 12 international flights landed in about a 45 minute period). The line abreast was about 20+ people and 200 yards long ahead of me, pretty much at a standstill. We moved slowly toward some unknown destination. At the end of this mess was one entry point that could handle a few (2-3) people at the same time. Passengers were jostling to get into the entry. We then noticed this entryway was for a serpentine maze of about 30 twists and turns. Looking behind me I saw the crowds getting bigger. After 20 minutes I came to the end of this queue. Get this - it led to one exit staffed by one (1) Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officer. OHer sole function was to look at your passport cover and point you right (US passport) or left (foreign passports). Seriously. How stupid. Despite numerous signs telling passengers to have their passports ready, many passengers didn't. Instead of telling them to step aside, the agent patiently waited for them to go through their luggage to find it. A second agent stopped by for a minute and then left. Why not have signs way, way back in the corridor to avoid this? I took the escalators down to another massive queue. More waiting. Finally interviewed by a CBP officer. This didn't take long. Claimed my bag, rechecked it, and then wondered into another abyss. We had to go through TSA security again. I have PreCheck - I saw signs for it but not for the entrance. People were looking everywhere for the entrance. I ended up having to backtrack 100 feet to find a not so obvious sign. Six people ahead of me. None, again, none of them had PreCheck but were just as lost. The agent was in good humor when I made it to him - his comment was something like ""Wow, an actual PreCheck passenger!"" I think poor signage had a lot to do with it. I made it to my gate just as the plane was boarding. What a mess!",-1,DEN

We departed downtown Denver using the morning RTD train from Union Station. It was fine. Discharged from the RTD train to take a huge steep escalator (if not working use the Westin elevators), to the cold open air Westin plaza and into the main terminal to catch the robo shuttle to terminals A, B or C. You better know which one you want. Got off at terminal B to be greeted by a huge network of TSA security cordons. Where is airline baggage check-in? Asked a TSA Agent nice enough to point us the directions- down the hall, up an elevator to the UAL counters. Checked baggage in, then around the counters, down an escalator, and back to the madness of the security lines. Everyone in a mad rush. Take your time and stay calm. Airport lacking signage. I have been in big domestic and intl. airports without Denver Intl.'s problems. Be prepared.",-1,DEN

Departing Denver at 5:40am -I don't know whether they didn't want to be there, maybe it was to early. She (TSA agent) walked right past us with a pallet full of bins. She wasn't moving because she was talking/laughing and the line in front of me was moving. I told my son to grab a couple bins since we were holding up the lines by not having a bin. Only then did she start moving and wouldn't let him take one. She told him to ""Come get it"" very nastily after she walked past us. I won't even start on us now having to walk all the way to the other side of the airport. It's confusing. No one was there to make sure we were even going in the right direction. No signs. There's no way this is a ""requirement by the FAA"" to have the most confusing layout I've ever seen. I've lived in 2 countries and traveled to most US states. I don't leave reviews on airports normally, but I live in Denver and I'm sad that I do. I've never had these experiences anywhere but here. I would leave 0 stars if I could.

The moment you walk in it's mass confusion, with absolutely zero signage or directions of any use. Hopefully you enjoy wandering around and didn't try to bring too much carry on to lug with you, because asking for help from some of the staff is a Russian roulette of what type of attitude you're going to get. I'd be more sympathetic, but I've also worked long hours interacting with the public, and there's no reason to be abrasive so long as people are being polite. TSA was the most pleasant part, and that's because they kept any interaction to a minimum so that the line could keep moving.",-1,DEN

Several people in line outside waiting on family to get to vehicle and told to leave. The police were having lots of fights with people in Arrivals line telling them to move and shining their flash light in their faces or into the windshield of cars making it hard to see to drive off. My children were literally walking out the door and the police officer told me to move now, I told him my kids are right there, he said no move now, go back around. I had to circle around 4 times to get my kids because they wouldn't allow you to stop more than 2 minutes. I was stopped a total of 8 minutes and told move now and was yelled at. Several people treated the same way. I use the airport 15 times a year every year and have never seen such rude behavior out of law enforcement.

Previously had two locations so that it was convenient based on which airline you used. Now they have, and they use the word consolidated, so there is only one TSA location so instead of having 50% roughly of the customers who are TSA pre approved going to each location you are forced to go to one location therefore there is literally no time advantage. Took about 30 minutes, so absurd. The only remaining advantage of course is you don't have to take your shoes off. What a complete disappointment, big government gone wrong.

Denver airport joins Paris Airport as one of the worst. Very poor and confusing signage. Long long hikes especially to retrieve luggage and no options for assistance for those with walking difficulty. (I have MS making long walks difficult).

From the ticket agents that are either screaming about electronic check in, or at the check in desk. The American Airlines agents are the worst!

Perhaps not the fanciest, but reasonable, navigable, and manageable. The last two+ years however have been pure travel hell.  This ongoing construction project that never ends is a nightmare. Still no food in the main concourse. Still a disaster area ever where you turn. This place should qualify as a blight and get disaster funding. When does this nightmare end Denver?  Outlying parking lots are still closed because they have no drivers. The crowded trains that run on the strangest schedules. Never enough, always loaded to over-capacity.  The ridiculous security lines. Enough said. Ridiculous and unacceptable. Just ridiculous. Closed bathrooms. Don't pass one if you see one. All the broken floor tiles around the baggage areas. I am sure the ground moved, but really this is our airport? Every trip through there is another experience in ""worst airport ever"". So sad.",-1,DEN
2021-09-21,0.3,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,an absolute nightmare,True," I rarely write a review, and then only if it's positive. Denver International, however, is the exception. Almost everything about this place is bad. TSA check in is an absolute nightmare. TSA precheck line had maybe 500 people. Non-precheck had 2 lines with maybe 1000 people each. Everything is dirty. Especially the bathrooms. The airport has the feel of a Soviet-era prison without all the glitz. Sure, most airports today aren't fun. Weird TSA security layouts, understaffing, closed facilities. It's just the way things are. Denver takes it to another level. For example, the rental car facilities are dirty and understaffed. I waited almost an hour and a half in a rental car pickup line before I cancelled the car, walked out, and took Uber to Colorado Springs. The on-site gas station was unbelievably filthy with trash spilled all over the ground. If you're arriving on an international flight and have bags, you have to collect the bags and transfer them. This process is standard. At Denver though, you have to collect your bags, take them upstairs and outside to a curbside pickup, then return inside and downstairs to go through security. I might be able to overlook all this if the airport weren't in Colorado and 30 miles from downtown Denver. If you get stuck at DIA, you're spending a lot of time and money finding a hotel or a new wait out of the state. It's just not worth it. Play it safe and use SLC, Vegas, or Phoenix. If you're in Colorado, enjoy the breath of fresh air that is Colorado Springs Airport. You've been warned.",-1,DEN

I had nothing to drink for several hours, not allowed to bring beverages through security, and nothing was open for purchase! Not one place. There were no drinking fountains either, so I had no choice but to drink the warm water out of the bathroom sink. The airport was very difficult to navigate as there were no signs giving any directions! Construction everywhere I looked, escalator out of service, I walked so much that my feet were swollen! When I got lost, I couldn't locate any help, except for one employee who shooed me away when I started asking him a question. Terrible customer service!

Loved Stapleton but realized we needed a larger airport to accommodate the influx of new people to the area. DIA was built not long ago but super short-sighted as it has never operated efficiently for travelers. For many years, it’s been under construction causing delays/obstructions and it seems no one can figure out what to do to fix the many problems with this newly built antiquated airport. If you’re building a billion $ hotel here - it can be erected quickly. I’m a frequent traveler and am planning to move from Denver Metro area so I never need to travel to DIA again!

Then there is always some type of construction. I typically brace myself and 'deal with it'. But yesterday the pre check on north security was closed and there was a full line waiting for regular check. I raced to the south side. TSA pre check had 3 lines and the clear queue funneled to one gentleman. Frazzled I held up my pass and he gave me the 'lady put it on the scanner look'. At least he apologized when I complained about booking a terminal length to go through his line on the south. Finally through TSA and down the stairs to very backed up and broken train the terminals. After three trains I was able to get one to the C gates. I charged to the gate with a few minutes to get some water for my asthma which was now flaring up from all the people, the humidity in the terminal and my perspiration soaked mask. I asked where the water was to fill my bottle and was told it was 30 gates away back in the center. I did not want to risk missing boarding so I went to vending and found one machine half empty with only pepsi and mt dew. No water. In desperation I got a pepsi. Then I went to the restroom - the stall floors were littered, soap dispensers empty. The germiest place on earth is a bathroom and without soap or even hand sanitizer I cannot follow covid protocol. Disgusting and contrary to the mask mandate. Understood and even flexible that Covid has taken its toll on everyone but the lack of signs, supervisors, and basic needs is unacceptable. I recommend more supervisors on weekends and make sure they are visible and available - it is season! Prioritize cleanliness of restrooms and provide clean drinking water.",-1,DEN
2021-07-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,TSA experience was terrible,False,"  The Denver TSA experience was terrible. Every person had to stand next to another person and walk about 50 ft while a dog was put on them to sniff for whatever. It was demeaning and reminded me of the scene from Shindlers list. This was a clear effort to control and abuse passengers, not for security purposes. Dogs are discretely used in airports, no problem. This was control by an abusive government. I have called my congressman about this issue. Arrival at the baggage area, no vending for water. It was over 100 degrees out. Nobody to help, no information booth. I had to ask airline employees for information. I will never fly out of Denver again and would only use it for a connection. It is a terrible airport. The giant TSA screening area is a stockyard not fit for humans. What a disaster.",-1,DEN
2021-07-05,0.4,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,This airport is very very understaffed,True," Denver had only McDonalds (gross) open during our delay. There were no food kiosks available due to short staffing that could be coin or card operated. No phone charger docks via vending either. Would have been very helpful. Plenty of chair charging docks-but if you don’t have a cord you’re screwed. Also why can’t airports have designated sleeping areas other than the scant cushions that only the lucky find? Sleeping on the floor-great. I did like the frequency of the gate train to get you to A, B, C gates. $14 for a turkey sandwich and $23 for a charger cord. Weather delays are real money makers for the airport concessioners. Thanks and happy Fourth of July. Not. The next day I had to walk up and down the B corridor twice just to spot the signage for Gate A to get to the train. My ankle still hurts from all the walking I did. There was no one at the information booth to help place a call for a hotel or car. The security guy told me to jump the 3 block line at customer service. Yeah right buddy. This airport is very very understaffed and as per usual overpriced. Gate B 3-9 area was beautifully designed with open glass walls and glass cathedral ceilings. Great great pod seating, comfortable chairs that support you when you put your head back. The music was also good throughout the terminal. Too bad the rest of the airport seemed like an older and uglier version of somewhere else. Bravo for this slice of heaven.",-1,DEN

We have just gone through a pandemic is no surprise to anyone, airport should be ashamed of their staff and lack of care for people using airport.

2021-06-15,0.1,Business,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,Departure was a nightmare,False,"  Arrival is okay although you have to look for the hidden boards indicating assigned baggage carousel. We walked the length of the baggage claim area and looked at each carousel before finding ours. Departure was a nightmare. Priority check in was slower than regular. Other customers had to help us with self-check in. We followed signs to North security only to find out that the TSA line was closed and we were redirected to South Security. There were no signs how to get to south security. We had to ask 3 separate people and ended up in baggage claim again. We finally found a police officer who gave us proper directions. After finding south security I set off the walk thru alarm, went back through and was then selected for a random search, they swabbed my hands and the test indicated positive which required a more than thorough patdown. The agent pulled open my waistband, pulled up my shirt, all in front of the crowd. The TSA agent told me hand lotion sometimes gives a false test. Seriously!? Perhaps we need a better test or this was just BS. I was humiliated during the whole process. There is no way a reasonably intelligent person can navigate this airport due to their poor signage. This was my second bad experience - my first made me miss my flight due to poor signage. Never again. I suggest you fly into Colorado Springs and drive to Denver before using this airport. Also, all food options had lines so long you would miss your flight.",-1,DEN

There are zero Amenities in the main terminal. Security is slow, airline counters are jammed, directional signs are awful. In the concourses all the amenities are clustered in the central area and are all jammed with long lines and not enough seating. Gates do not have enough seating and most electrical outlets don’t work. Every time I fly through here I have to help lost people figure out how to get on the train to the terminal to baggage claim. This is literally one of the worst airports now.",-1,DEN
2021-05-23,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,a pleasure going to Denver Airport,False,  My husband and I were treated with respect and compassion.

It was such a pleasure going to Denver Airport and leaving. We would recommend them at any time.,1,DEN

I was appalled to see how filthy the terminal seats are - disturbing at any time, much less during a pandemic. The seats (I was in terminal A) had visible sweat streaks on the backs and seats, stains of various colors (brown, gray) from unknown, organic substances (some trailing down the back of the seat), and overall just looked completely unsanitary to sit in. I did not visit the restrooms, but would imagine that if they get regular service, the toilet seats are less bacteria- and germ-ridden than the terminal seats, which appear never to be cleaned. Shame on Denver Airport for disregarding passenger safety during a global pandemic by not cleaning these. I had to break out my own disinfecting wipe to clean the seat before using it. Shameful.",-1,DEN

We are used to getting blizzards even. The snow stopped at 10 pm, 3/15/2021. It is now 11 am on 03/15/2021 and they still haven't got the snow removed. That is pathetic. You had trucks out all night.

2021-02-06,0.7,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,Denver Airport security was molasses slow,True," This airport has the most inefficient TSA security check process I have ever experienced. I've been to many other airports and their security often makes you feel rushed they are moving you through so quickly and efficiently. Denver Airport security was molasses slow. Lots of standing around waiting for your bin to enter the scan device and then waiting again on the other side of the body scan for your bin to complete its scan. So slow! After I went through the whole process I saw 2 main items that would help speed up the process at Denver Airport: 1) Automated return of security bins. Security checkpoints at other airports have automated bin returns which really speed things up. At the faster airports there is a worker feeding them into an automated bin return and they are quickly made available at the start of the line. Denver Airport had workers using very inefficient carts with bad mobility. My daughter and I couldn't help chuckling at a worker that was slowly navigating a cart with a stack of bins bumping into doors and other items as she struggled to slowly steer the cart from the end of the line back to the start. 2) Have travelers separate out items into different bins with no layers for security scan. Security checkpoints at other airports have you place your electronics in separate bins with now layer/piling of items on top of each other. For example, in Seattle they have you remove your laptop(s) from your bag. Same for your cell phone and bags of liquids. At Denver Airport they had everyone place everything in one tray each all piled on top of each other. Goo grief! No wonder the guy looking at the scanner had to stare at the screen for ages! It took forever. Extremely inefficient and slow for no good reason. Whomever is in charge of security at Denver Airport should take a trip to some other airports and pick up some efficiency improvement ideas. It would go a long way in getting travelers through their security area more quickly. The would also likely need fewer security stations, less equipment and fewer security workers. Aside from the slowness and inefficiency at security, the rest of the experience was fine. There was some construction, but it didn't disrupt our ability to get from point A to point B.",1,DEN
2021-01-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,DIA is a monstrosity,False,"  I’m a long-time traveler, having been to all 50 states, elite status on most airlines, and traveled to or through a lot of US airports. DIA is a monstrosity. Arriving, it took forever to find a way to get to baggage claim - I walked the terminal over taking the train as suggested to avoid crowds but there were no easy ways to get back down to baggage claim, eventually took an elevator. The RDA train to the city is super convenient, but the escalator to get down to it had a closed sign blocking it with no alt offered - eventually found an elevator to take me down. Departing was a nightmare. Getting off train, no easy signs for where check in is, but it dumps you at United, which had lines out the wazoo for everything. Security was snaked for miles and miles. I would hate this airport in particular if I was flying United - on what should be a light day of travel, long lines for everything, most not distanced. I actually had to stop and look up where Southwest check in was on my phone - never have I been unable to navigate an airport based on signage alone. TSA was a nightmare. The north security has shorter lines but I, like many others in front of me, had bags pulled for extra screening. I waited an additional 20 minutes for this check, bunched together with others. They had to check the pockets of my backpack, which were filled with coins and other random junk and has passed through TSA screening at least 10 times with everything in it with no extra search needed. I then darted off to the train to get to the gate and, not being familiar and with no signing, I accidentally got off at the A gates because A51 was prominently called out on my boarding pass - but actually gate was C42, that was just my boarding position. Absolutely no signage or announcement about airlines are at what terminals and every terminal looks exactly the same. I barely made the flight - I was the last passenger on. I hate this airport - it’s massive, confusing, and crowded.",-1,DEN

On November 19, 2020 my nephew and I flew from BWI-DEN to connect to DEN-EUG to visit my son on United Airlines. Upon arrival at Denver International Airport, I was shocked to see so many travelers not practicing social distancing. It looked like a regular day at the airport pre-COVID where no one was practicing social distancing. There were lines at the eatery, Smash Burger in particular, where there were no social distancing guidelines and the patrons did not take it upon themselves to do such. What was more distressing was that at the sitting area at the gates there was no signage as to be 6ft apart or the seats with the signage to be 6ft apart. Some travelers did not have their mask on or did not have their mask on properly - meaning over mouth and nose. It did not look like security was reminding people to social distance. There was even one man strolling through the airport with the mask in his hand swinging it back and forth. CDC and other health officials have warned about traveling safely during the holidays. I did not feel safe at Denver International Airport! While at this point I do not know if Colorado has mandated strong COVID prevention practices, I will say I was surprised that travelers were not taking precautions. Please note that until there is a way to slow down the infection rate of COVID-19, I will not be going to or transferring planes in Denver, CO. Stay informed. Wear a mask. Be safe.",-1,DEN

Went thru security in 3 min with global entry then waited over 1 hr for bag. I had priority service as a close connection. United 3 staff at 11.30 am were lazy, terrible, and not assisting at the baggage carousel. The one agent ripped my tag off my bag, said run to your gate and from there on a nightmare. No assistance. The bags were to be on carousel 3 from Costa Rica then 2. Japan Airlines arrived 15 min after us and bags were off loaded. Shame on United Airlines. Went thru tsa again as international security and tsa not the same in Denver. No direct connections for international passengers transiting thru. Waste of money and intelligence really. Tsa agent took my 100 ml Jam as they don’t understand its less than 3 ounces. World uses metric, come on Denver, get educated. I gave it up. Tsa agent dished me from the tsa line as one of my boarding passes said tsa approved and the other didn’t have the stamp. So, sent me to the end of the other line. She knew I had 15 min. Another volunteer staff, assisted me and brought me thru to the front of the line. Those who have nexus, global entry should already be pre tsa approved. This is an airport I will purposely avoid. I ran past 50 gates, no assistance from tsa or United and missed the flight by 5 min. Went to the United assistance and explained what happened. The very seasoned agent, said, she knows the system here is awful and gave me a ticket on the next flight. Rating 1/10. Very poor.",-1,DEN

But the system was down, and I asked some customer service help, but their response was too rude to hear. I was in line for more than one and a half hours that made me late. So, I bought another new ticket (United Airline). I want to recommend all employees should be trained well, especially their mouth and eye, as well as they should know what their job is.

Wheel chairs were available, but no directions on how to acquire one, and no visible interest in assisting older or infirm people. Denver friendliness is a real issue.

Signage horribly placed and sometimes misleading - worst I've ever seen in an airport, I think. The wonderful light rail station shouldn't be hard to find, but this airport makes it hard to find. The baggage carousels take inordinately long to deliver the luggage. Unclean restrooms. Disgusting seats from the moment you check in with your airline to the moment you leave your gate. Gruff and mannerless TSA agents, even by TSA standards (then again, it is Colorado, which is arguably one of the U.S.' least friendly states). Even TSA Pre-Check passengers wait longer than in Pre-Check lines in other airports, I can also attest to how terrible the lines at DIA are for non-Pre-Check holders. Boring and unoriginal options for snacks, dining and drinks for such a large airport. At least the inter-terminal tram is clean, efficient and dependable, and, as I said, that light rail station is such a nice asset. Friends don't let friends fly in and out of Denver, y'all.

2019-10-19,0.3,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,train the officers to be better,True,"  Unfortunately, I encountered traffic on the way to the Denver Airport to catch my departure flight home. I got there later than desired, but was still going to make my flight. However, as I was going through the Tsa screening (I had my stuff on the belt, next in line to go through security), my lane and a handful of others stopped operating. This was around 5:00pm on 10/18/2019 The TSA officers made no attempt to explain to the people in line what was going on. Instead, the officers in my lane kept laughing and cracking jokes about ""the supervisors not doing their job"". They should be more sensitive and considerate of all the anxious people waiting to get to their flights. One guest in the lane next to mine remarked that his plane was leaving soon and he might miss his flight, to which the officer sarcastically replied, ""That's unfortunate."" without even giving the guest a glance. Another guests 2 kids had passed through the security gate right before the machines stopped, so he approached the officer after about 10 min and asked if the kids could come back through to stand in line with the parents so they wouldn't be waiting alone. The same officer mentioned above replied in an aggressive manner that ""they've been randomly selected and they'll be selected again when they come back in."" What he's saying is not wrong. It's how he said it that rubbed me, and undoubtedly the father, the wrong way. You could tell the father was annoyed because he simply didn't want his kids to be alone. My negative experience was mainly due to 1 or 2 officers, but there is obviously a work culture that tolerates this kind of behavior. There were other officers around that said nothing to correct the abovementioned officer's rude behavior. I have traveled a lot in my life, and can deal with a bit of rudeness, but this was over the top. Please, train the officers to be better people, which in turn will make them better employees. The Denver Airport processes many, many people each day, and bad employee behavior should not be an impediment.",-1,DEN

It’s the worst run airport I have been through. Escalators are broken consistently (perhaps 1/5 trips I make), bulbs are out in the elevators, and to make matters worse the major construction to shift security upstairs (complete remodel) has come to a halt. The contractors were recently terminated. Currently the terminal looks like it’s been through a demolition. On a good note the train that runs from Denver works well. On a bad note even the long term parking is expensive ($18 per day) and the shuttle buses run infrequently. This airport is run by the city of Denver.",-1,DEN

First, getting thru security was a nightmare because a screener was being trained. They discussed every bag! No attempt was made or any consideration given to travelers missing their flight. Second, no gate information is available until you get to terminal a, b, or c. So that is not helpful when United flies out of more than one terminal. I had to take a second train ride. Third, I had to use terminal b. It has 95 gates! And guess which gates are at the end? Local flights. What a way to treat guests coming to spend money in this state. Why the taxpayers put up with that I will never know. I don’t understand how voters put up with that.

But what happend in Denver Airport is inacceptable. Arriving at the security checkup with a broken arm in a cast and therefore quite handicapped I was treated in an extremely impolite and despiteous manner. The security officer shouted impatiently at me to move my luggage myself on the moving floor, his female colleague barked at me in bad slang with a ferocious face and pushed roughly around without any explanation when she was controlling me. When I was through they had much fun controlling my husband in the same rude and extensive manner, impeding him purposedly to help me collect my items. We gave no comment to them to avoid things getting even worse. This was an utterly bad experience, I felt rather like a head of cattle than a like human being. The behavior of such incompetent staff is a shame for Denver and is by no way worthy of an International Airport, but gave us the impression of a deepest ignorant and uneducated province.",-1,DEN

This was the worst experience I have ever had at an airport in all my travels. There is ongoing construction going on at this airport and this construction probably has a lot to do with my horrible experience. Trying to get from the point where the light rail ended at the airport to finally arriving at my departure gate was a pretty bad experience. The signage was confusing and incomplete while navigating around all the construction. The route to my gate was circuitous and aggravating. I had to stop and ask for help more than once. One employee apologized for all the craziness - she said the original company that was contracted for the construction work was ""fired"", and the city is now back to the drawing board finding a new company to do the job. This experience has left me with a bad taste, and until that airport construction is done, I would suggest you avoid flying out of Denver airport.",-1,DEN
2019-09-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,"When possible, I'll avoid Denver",False,"  I found Denver Airport very difficult for travelers to use and I recommend anyone who has to use it to leave lots of extra time and be prepared to be frustrated and treated rudely. The signs are poorly placed, when they exist. On arrival, finding the rental car shuttles was very badly marked. When I had finally gotten my car - the rental car offices are several miles away - and returned to the airport to pick up my daughter, one of the traffic officials was very unpleasant. There were no other cars in the row I was in or the next row, which were both permitted lanes for picking up passengers. There was room for easily 20 cars. I was typing in the address we were going to into Google Maps, and he came over to insist I leave. We had been there for less than 3 minutes. On departure, we had to walk a very long distance to the gate. If you have any mobility problems, request a wheelchair. Security was very badly run. There were 3 lanes open, but only 2 staff to check boarding passes and IDs. The middle staff member made no attempt to be sure that the left two lanes alternated, and no one bothered to change the lanes to two lanes. When I mentioned the problem to him, he said it was the travelers' fault that they weren't alternating because they were stepping up too fast. The lines at the food counters and in the convenience stores were very long because it is a very busy airport. The staff at the food counters and convenience stores were very nice and helpful. But don't count on having time to get food between flights. When possible, I'll avoid Denver.",-1,DEN

Under construction. The screening process is a zoo. Only comparable to maybe Atlanta. The TSA people are rude. The amount of walking you have to do is crazy.

If you are old, disabled or young and inexperienced forget about it. They want you to get lost and miss your flight. First off it's in the middle of nowhere.

They only had 3 agents working all US and Canadian citizens and two working the rest. The the next flight arrived and the global express line went through before they would continue with the other line. It was poorly managed and really embarrassing as a citizen of Colorado. So much talk from other passengers about never flying into DIA again and how Chicago and the east coast airports are so much better.",-1,DEN
2019-07-09,0.4,Family Leisure,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,1.0,staff I encountered were not helpful,False,"  This was my second time flying with my son who is now 18 months. Our departure experience is why I'm reviewing this airport. We got to the airport with plenty of time to spare because I knew from previous experience how long and time consuming security can be there. The first thing we did was stop at the rest room right by security. The people in front of us in line informed me there wasn't any toilet paper in the stalls. I was hoping they were misinformed but they were correct. There was no toilet paper. There was a woman with a TSA vest on in the restroom. Someone in the restroom asked her if she could let someone know there wasn't any toilet paper and she blankly looked at her and walked away. I was very surprised to see the security line wasn't very long! My 18 month old son has special needs. He has a feeding pump and has Cerebral Palsy therefore he is unable to stand or sit on his own. The TSA agent wanted our stroller to go through the conveyor belt machine. I told the agent I'd rather push it through so I would have someplace to set down my son while I gathered our things after they came through the belt. (I knew I'd have to hold my son but wanted to be able to set him down afterwards) She said no. She then took off all 3 of the stroller wheels and crammed it down so it fit through the machine. My son and I walked through where we were supposed to be and waited for our things. I had a backpack, laptop, my sons diaper bag, my sons feeding pump, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and my stroller without wheels to get after it went through the conveyor belt. So I'm standing there holding my son, who I can't set down anywhere wondering how I'm going to get all of this stuff back where it needs to be. Eventually I asked one of the TSA agents if they were going to put my stroller back together. I got a blank look and he went back to what he was doing. I then loudly said ""Someone better get over here and put my stroller back together"" and an agent put my stroller back together so I could set my son down and get all of our stuff. The staff I encountered during my time at Denver airport were not helpful. I originally flew from Minneapolis to Denver a week earlier and had zero trouble going through security. The staff at MSP was all very helpful and understanding. They let me push my stroller through so I could have someplace to set my son down. They helped me gather my things. And they were also busier than Denver was at the time.",-1,DEN
2019-07-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim,False,"  The strange experience started when our inbound flight from Frankfurt had to approach from the South and was sent many miles past the airport to turn for final approach, delaying our arrival. An extremely long level flight at minimum altitude followed before we reached the glidepath. Taxiing to the terminal was delayed again due to ""traffic"" - we stood on the taxiway for aeons with engines running. Entering the arrival concourse we found a long walk to the end of a huge crowd of arriving passengers queueing for so-called immigration. Coming from an efficient home airport we were overwhelmed. Even families with small children had to stand. If you had to go to the bathroom - forget it. We arrived at a few self-check machines where we had to type in lots of info plus give fingerprints and face photo. A slip was issued and we were so naive to think that was it - like at other airports in the world, and only customs would follow. No way. There was another queue (sort of like what cattle go thru at the slaughterhouse), even slower. When we were at the front, to our surprise, we got to an unfriendly (we had know they are from many previous US visits) inspector who did not bother to speak loud and clear. He wanted all the info the machine had asked just before, plus fingerprints, this time including the thumbs. We had the impression foreign tourists are a burden in this country. The baggage had long been removed from the delivery belt and put aside. The whole procedure took 100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim. The signage that should lead us to the TSA checkpoint was poor. TSA - long lines, we got to the front a bit faster as we were business class. The whole checkpoint was a complete zoo. Due to the new full body scan you had to remove the complete contents of your pockets, handkie, notepaper everything. Then the train ride - more or less swift. The departure gate was not friendly and inviting, not enough seating and poor shops. The airline refused to let us wait in the first class lounge as we were not members. Thanks goodness here in Europe you can use the lounges if you go business.",-1,DEN

My biggest frustration is the train that runs between terminals. At night the airport decides to run the trains on a significantly reduced schedule regardless of how many passengers are waiting for it. I’ve seen 20 minutes between trains, with the waiting area so packed that only half of the people can board the 1st train, so they have to wait another 20 minutes.

There should be a sign or some sort of notice that if you accidentally take the train to baggage claim instead of the gates, then you will be forced to go through the mile-long security line again. Ask an employee where to find something and they'll send you to a wrong area where someone will yell at you and act like you're an idiot for not knowing this place inside and out on your first visit. Our flight was canceled and there was no comfortable place for my daughter or I to lay down and rest there during our 25 hours (every hotel and motel was booked solid). Horrible layout, inefficient service, and incompetent employees. Will never ever fly into or out of this airport again - Colorado Springs is worth the extra money.",-1,DEN

I am flying urgently to see my daughter who has been taken into hospital so I was already feeling anxious. The guy who checks passports was sat in his chair, morbidly obese, yelling at people in the line (it was 5.30am so not busy). Leaving people totally flustured. The lady standing by the scanners gave me a humiliating telling off for simply saying “excuse me, do I need to take my boots off for the scanner?”. Apparently I was “interrupting her”.

I don't know what happened, but Denver cut back on expenses and it shows through their hiring! The staff that works there are, I'm sorry to say, but the same customer service level as McDonald's! Maybe if they paid better, they would receive higher standards of employees. I watched a woman cleaning the floor with a dust pan bucket and broom, leisurley passing trash and picking up just some as my 8 month old b-lined it for old food, cups, etc. on a 5 hour layover. The bathrooms reminded me of truck stops, and the chairs smelled of - God only knows. They had holes and tears and rips across them as if the whole airport is falling apart and they are unable to afford maintenance. I will connect through Salt Lake City from now on.

I’m in the third trimester of my pregnancy and had the absolute worst experience. I got to the airport about an hour and a half before my flight departed and I found an extremely long line that you would have thought there was still a govt shutdown. This was on both sides of the airport. I was really worried about missing my flight after seeing the line but more importantly about waiting too long in line given my pregnancy, but the TSA person assisting on the line told me it would be no more than 20 mins. It took over an hour to go through and when I asked agents to assist me given my late pregnancy state, they kept telling me there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait in line. I missed my flight after having to run through the airport and had to deal with hyper ventilation at the closed gate where my flight was departing from. What a nightmare of an experience!

I'd highly recommend getting here at least 3 hours before your flight, even if it is at 6AM. This last time we had a 6AM flight and when we got to PreCheck we were treated as normal flyers, had to remove belts, shoes, glasses, hearing aids, empty pockets of everything.

Arrived on a packed flight from Frankfurt, Germany. Passengers were limited to the use of two computers for mandatory self processing (scan passport, take your photo, declaration questions...) at the first check point. I heard an agent say this was to slow down people getting to the next backed up line at the customs counter. An efficient agent should have announced those needing to make a connecting flight have priority, and then got them to the front of both lines. The customs backlog created bags lying around baggage claim. Self absorbed and rude staff in that area were too busy talking with coworkers to answer my desperate need for directions; a body scanner was down when I finally reached the congested security check point for my next flight. A lot of staff standing around instead of reloading needed trays. Never saw one cart and driver, so had to run to final destination. Again, an efficient manager could have projected the need to have carts and drivers available to assist those of us trying to make connecting flights. Yes, signage is lacking or poorly done; yes, too many staff are without basic customer service skills, lack creative problem solving skills, and take no initiative.

It is hard to bring me to tears but this airport did it. The frustration of signage, untrained staff, security issues. I left my coat as I was helping an elderly man with his cane. To go back to where I left it, South security, took over an hour to find anything with the signage. My arrival a week before was confusing. Baggage signs, go upstairs? Who has baggage upstairs? Which terminal, East or West? I got asked that for 2 pickups and nowhere does it say East or West. The hotel transport lady finally asked what color signs I as looking at. Nowhere does it say you will be taking a train to baggage. I went on an escalator and was by myself in a small highway. Apparently this was a train waiting area with no one there and no signs. Scary to say the least. Go to level 5 which turns into level 6 and after you take 2 elevators, an escalator and a moving walkway you might find a gate that also has 3-4 flights out of one gate and they are all leaving within the hour. I too, will never go near the Denver airport. I thought I might like living in Denver but this sent me running.",-1,DEN

We drove around for 30 minutes or more until we could find our rental server. Then we waited until the American desk opened. The person who took our luggage said to proceed to our gate in the A terminal. There was no available security area opened. The sign on the west side said it was closed and to proceed to the opposite terminal. We walked over to the east side and that wasn’t open either however there were approximately 20 TSA agents behind the glass. Another passenger walked by and said we needed to go to the South security. I understand renovations are occurring but that was extremely poor signage and service.

We had a connecting flight one and a half hours later. Despite having that time frame we missed our next flight due to no organization to help transfer either by travellers who have been delayed by no fault of their own. It took us over an hour to get through passport controls and security checking. For instance there could have been organization for a quicker line for travellers with boarding passes for next flights within the next 1-2 hours. Very frustrating experience.,-1,DEN

We could not find any comfy chairs. Those AP chairs are so uncomfortable and armless, good luck in terminal A. Admirals Club only open during the day and not at night, food court left a lot to be desired at Terminal A. They should update the seating and put rockers in like Charlotte. Even places to sleep overnight with sofas and TVs. Very large lot of walking from Main Building to flight Terminals. I felt like John McClain running down the walking sidewalks. Not laid out well and nowhere quiet to sleep. Could not wait to get out of Denver. Only 2 TSA entrances so come early, very crowded. Restrooms were nasty and unclean.

I must sadly say that arriving into Denver international airport on international flights is always very painful, literally a 3rd world experience. Coming off the plane, passengers are herded into narrow hallways and escalators. The first waiting line for the automated immigration desks often takes 30 to 40 minutes. Then, to everyone’s surprise there is a second, long queue downstairs, that also often take 20 to 30 minutes. Luggage takes forever to reach the carousels. I would suggest that the management of the DIA airport travels to Singapore or Doha, Dubai or Bangkok to see how it is done. Colorado deserves better at its first International Gateway.",-1,DEN

Coming in on a connecting international flight I unfortunately don’t have 2-4 hours. I had 1 hour to make my gate. No checked bags, traveling solo, passes pre printed it doesn’t matter. It’s as if they have mud in their shoes and are under the influence of something other than compassion and customer service. Nothing will come of this review, I just suggest trying any possible way to not go to the Denver airport aka DIA. I personally will pay double for any ticket to fly non stop from my hometown. Unfortunately that was not an option on this flight. Congratulations TSA! You are the worst customer service I can think of.",-1,DEN

I arrived at the airport in plenty of time ""I thought"" to catch my 8:05 a flight this morning but after waiting 20 minutes to only go 12 feet I knew it was going to be a frustrating experience. When I finally got to the scan machine the poor gentlemen in front of me underwent a search that a referee would surely call ""illegal use of the hands"". I did not get out unscathed either - I got held up by Deputy Dog and he proceeded to frisk my right pant leg and my neck. After that he scanned my cashews and pistachios as they must have looked threatening. Therefore, the worst airport experience for me by far goes to DIA.

The high point was once through security a brief walk down stairs to the train to take us to our departure gate (via the Admiral's lounge or is it Admirals'?).

What other airport does this? Have a question for TSA? Good luck getting it answered. They'll just glare at you and move on.

2024-04-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,never experienced a worse airport,False,"   Horrifying experience. We had a connecting flight in DFW to another US city and they forced us to go through customs, get our bags from baggage claim, recheck our bags and go through tsa security again. We requested wheelchair assistance and no one was there to help get us off the long ramp. All the disabled people had to walk to customs. We finally got someone to help us when we got to customs. Then they took over an hour to check in the wheelchair line. They closed off the general section and forced everyone able-bodied into the TSA pre check which defeats the whole purpose of pre check. When we finally got through security, we still had to wait longer with no shoes no phones waiting for the rest of our stuff. Then they didn’t let us bring in any of our duty free items because it didn’t fit in their tiny security scanner. Mind you everything was locked and wrapped properly in a duty-free security bag. Why on earth weren’t we told any restrictions before we even got to Dallas? So duty free is totally pointless when you’re forced to pay a fee to check in the items. All of that took over an hour and half and we almost missed our connecting flight. I’ve never experienced a worse airport in my life. I highly recommend avoiding any connecting flights to this airport or you will also experience a total nightmare. Edit: Forgot to mention that our connecting gate number was literally in the same terminal only 6 gates away. So we went through all this BS for a gate I could have literally walked to.",-1,DFW

Frontier delayed our flight coming home on Sunday March 3rd. We initially were supposed to take off around 930pm. We were notified that Frontier had delayed our flight due to crew regulations to take off now at 115am. We had family at the hotel in Dallas, so we stayed at the hotel rather than hang out at the airport. We arrived at DFW at 11pm. We checked our bag at the Frontier baggage counter and went to the security line. We were in line and walking toward the screening. The employees could see us. They quickly closed the door on us, even though I was talking with them. They did not respond to my greeting or my question of why they were closing the door on us! They ran away! We were not able to make our flight, even though our luggage was checked and we were in line! Is this how DFW values their passengers? This incident has created financial and incredible emotional stress. If I can ever help it, I will never fly into DFW again. It was a horrible experience. I tried to speak to another security guard and his response was to laugh at us! He treated us with scorn and open hostility and told us we were out of luck and to come back the next morning!

Parking is readily available across from whichever terminal you park in. Admittedly some garages lack elevators which can be inconvenient. Nonetheless, you can park in any terminal and take the shuttle between the terminals or the train between the terminal. On this particular trip, I flew out of terminal E. Found a parking spot directly across from one of the TSA checkpoint. As we didn't check luggage, we breezed through TSA Pre checkpoint and situated ourselves in the United Lounge. At this early departure, terminal was not crowded at all and the concourse are wide with plenty of windows giving views of the runways and airfield.",1,DFW
2024-01-29,0.2,Business,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,one of the worst airports in the US,False,"  DFW continues to be one of the worst airports in the US. Unfortunately, it is also my home airport so I spend a lot of time there. The terminal layouts are too spread out with often no possible way of walking between them. The train providing transports between terminals is adequate, but quite boring compared to other airports. Terminal services are hit or miss. Customer service mediocre at best. The parking garages are of an ancient design with no elevators or escalators except in Terminal D (the newest terminal at present) Which makes it very difficult to get luggage to the check in counters within the terminal. Other than Terminal D, the entire airport is very dated, inefficient and not up to the standards set by airports in more sophisticated parts of the world.",-1,DFW

Given the midday departure, terminal was busy with plenty of seating available at the gates. Breezed through security with a minimal time thanks to TSA Pre privileges. Had a light lunch at TGIF which served very tasty and excellent food. One of the best features of DFW is the parking garages. I was able to find a spot in the garage opposite the Delta gates and to the TSA Entry Point. WiFi in both the restaurant and the gate was blazing fast.. The terminal is brightly lit with a wide open concourse and plenty of dining options charging points at every gate. Lavatories were very clean.",1,DFW
2024-01-12,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,so ridiculously small and lacks so much,False,"  For such a busy airport it is so ridiculously small and lacks so much other international airports offer. There is minimal dining, cafes, shopping and anything that is there is mediocre. It’s a shame since they are continually under construction, at least since I’ve lived here the last 9 years, but nothing actually changes. Also, parking is terrible for such a busy airport. The design of the parking and terminals is silly and not commuter friendly, but nothing I. Texas is. You have to walk miles if you have to park in another terminal’s parking lot while your plane departs or returns to a different terminal. This happens a lot since AA is constantly moving gates right up until 15 mins before they land. This is not pleasant late at night in the dark and much of the airport is closed. You have to go outside and locate the bus which is difficult to find. I feel bad for visitors who get into this predicament. It’s better not to park there and get a ride. It’s actually easier to avoid AA and go with another airline.",-1,DFW

I can't rate any dining options as they were closed given my early departure 5:30 a.m. Inbound flight arrival was at Terminal E my favorite terminal. Both Terminal C and E have wide open concourses and plenty of dining options. The terminal is brightly lit with a wide open concourse and plenty of dining options charging points at every gate.

Today I went through TSA coming in from Mexico, and had to go through security again. The young man at the front stays to leave my laptop uncovered. My bag got pushed out the line because of this, and the older man proceeded to jump into my mother and I’s conversation and said “you weren’t supposed to do that, you just weren’t listening”. He then proceeded to walk to the another man and started talking about me under his breath as if I wasn’t standing there watching him. I fly all the time and have never had TSA behave like that. He’s lucky I didn’t get a chance to see his name. I don’t recommend flying out of here at all, they lack respect for travelers, and organization.

Difficult to get around especially when you have to take the car service but still nearly miss your connecting flight. They make sure those with disabilities and special assistance are put last on purpose. It's a disgrace. I just don't understand because I about missed my flight to Oklahoma city due to the staff that just didn't care.

But I was disheartened to see the condition of this airport. I will say first that the restrooms are very clean. However, the seating areas and the condition of some of the restaurants caused me to second guess eating here. I am currently seated in Gate A11 waiting for a flight to Tampa and as I sit here I can smell the carpet beneath me. It has not been cleaned for sometime. The seats need to be wiped off and the floors have a heavy collection of dust along the walls. I am not complaining. I'm writing in hope that a greater incentive will be given to the people that work here in order to take care and pride in the work they do. I've seen several cleaning carts roll by stopping only to conduct a few sweeps and then continuing on.

We were late due to American Airlines not  scheduling a Pilot to fly that flight at 6:50 am departure from Buffalo, New York to Dallas, Texas. Joshua  was amazing to make sure I made my connection flight to Albuquerque from Buffalo on March 6, 2023, scheduled to leave Buffalo at 6:50am, but didn't leave for over an hour late. He went above and beyond to accommodate me and my circumstance. If it weren't for Joshua I would never had made my connection and the extra travel time would have been detrimental on my physically disabled body and injuries. We ran into roadblocks, that included an elevator with cones around it. We finally made it up to get the train to the other terminal, where he was amazing to get me to the correct terminal and gate. Everyone was already boarding and the last was boarding. We made it in time.

Airports are basically places where certain things happen at an exact time, so I don't know who got the idea to make this airport the slowest in the entire US. It is to me amazing that for connecting flights, you need to go to customs and then literally go outside the airport, and enter again, like if you have arrived at that precise moment.  The line of Customs is absurdly large, with some officers hitting on tourists. The airport has hired some red-jackets to ""redirect the traffic"". They basically don't really help. I was probably 1 h 30 min there. Then, when entering the airport and passing through security control again, after staying in the immense line and thinking of when the next flight was happening, a guy told me that if I pay 30 dollars I can skip the que, amazing as it sounds, I payed and I skip the whole que. Only to reach the door 15 minutes before where a rude American airlines woman told me that the boarding is closed, and that I cannot enter.  Please avoid it.",-1,DFW
2023-02-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,The terminals are very far apart,False,"  The Dallas/Fort Worth Airport apparently is quite huge. I did not anticipate how far the electric tram had to travel between terminals. The terminals are very far apart. I landed at a gate in terminal D. The connecting flight was to depart in 41 minutes, so boarding time left little room for error. A bathroom stop, a moment to get a paper, then purchase a snack for the plane, all at my arrival terminal (D) I did not realize shaved precious minutes off time to catch my connecting flight. The tram came quickly, but then seemed to go on forever. No recorded voice telling me what stop coincided with what gates contributed to my overshooting my stop by one stop (my gate was C-37, I could swear that never showed up on the screen above the tram doors). I caught another tram car headed in the other direction, which at the next stop did have my gate posted on the electronic sign above the door, went down the long, steep escalator, and ran to my gate. The staff had just closed the door to the gate. I showed them my boarding pass and asked if I could get in. I started feeling as though this couldn't be happening, I should have had plenty of time to reach my flight, but here I was. Fortunately, they let me in. I ran down the gangway thinking they might close the plane door in my face, got on the plane and did make it to my destination.",-1,DFW

We lucked out with TGIF as it was directly across from our gate. Lavatories were clean but could be cleaner. I can't rate WiFi as I did not connect to it. Arrival from Cancun was at Terminal D.

The lighting is very good as is the signage. The terminal is very clean and there is plenty of seating at the gates. There are several TSA Entry Points with signs indicating which entry points have less waiting time. United Airlines has a few gates here as does JetBlue and Delta.

By this time, the gate attendants were gone. I rushed along the route and was finally able to snag a transit cart but did not make my connection. The cart dropped me at customer service where there was a line, including a man in a wheelchair and his relative who were in the same sinking boat as me. Since my arrival flight arrived a couple of minutes early, I was not given a hotel room. I was booked on the next flight to my destination which would not take off for 24-hrs. My destination was Connecticut, not some tiny, out-of-the-way airport. I asked and was told my checked bag would be waiting at BDL. 24 hours later, I finally made it home and my bag was apparently back in Dallas. Never will I travel that airline or use DFW!",-1,DFW

On the day of our departure, the lounges had waits for 35-45 minutes whether you were a business class passenger or had a membership. There was plenty of seating available at the gates. The concourses are wide and have plenty of concessions. There is a long walk to passport control. The HVAC seemed to be working well as the arrivals hall and baggage claim were very comfortable. Using Mobile Passport Control, I was able to avoid the long lines and get through in less than 5 minutes. Unlike our last trip, baggage came out very quickly.

Upgrades are coming and they couldn't come any sooner. The concourse was very crowded and there was a lack of seating at the gate area. I was unable to connect to the free DFW Airport WiFi. The jetways to the aircraft seem to lack AC unlike some of the newer terminals at DFW. On arrival at gate C4, we couldn't exit the terminal building and had to go all the way to gate C17 which has 24 hour entry/exit.",1,DFW

A major international airport that is reliant on a slow, late, overcrowded shuttle bus system to get from one terminal to another? It took an hour and a half to go from the C4 bag claim to A10 where you can catch a bus. 90 minutes to go half a mile.

Its a disaster every single time, tons of people miss flights every day just because Delta won't bring counter employees in soon enough to actually get passengers checked in. About ready to never fly out of DFW again on Delta. Wonder if all of the airlines suck this bad early in the morning. This puts the employees in a horrible situation every single day and you think the airline would not want this kind stress and chaos every single day.",-1,DFW

The concourse are wide and have plenty of concessions. The bathrooms have a lighting system which indicates whether a stall is occupied or unoccupied much like that in the parking garages. Arrived at Terminal D from Istanbul. There's a long walk to passport control. Passport Control took no more than 15 minutes. Baggage Claim was disappointing. The AC appeared to be not working as it was very warm. Baggage took almost an hour to be brought up and the luggage came out on two different adjacent carousels.,1,DFW

From the review, this is a more common problem, which we also experienced today. We had a layover and had to continue after Cancun where we had 1 hour and 50 minutes. Due to the occupation at customs, it took too long after reporting to the staff several times, no action is taken to help. Immediately after flying we walked on to stand in line. After missing the flight, went after the service desk, no empathy was shown by the staff. Where they could still salvage something from the bad experience. If no solution was found, and the people from the service desk blame it on the government. The reputation has now been damaged where there were solutions to soften the notion, something of a comfortable place to sleep.

And to find the pre TSA ask 4 people that works their basically just rude and didn’t answer and just point saying that way. Pointed at a direction all of them pointed different way. The staff there don’t really care and some people saw me and said oh that was helpful. Basically saying what kind of answer was that, how rude didn’t stop just kept on walking.

2022-03-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,I would stay away from DFW at this time,False,"  I am writing this review as a warning to others: transiting through DFW as a foreigner is absolute hell. It is chaos, stressful and inefficient and on top of that now also sort of useless as our passports were not even checked upon reaching the front of the line, we were simply waved through. We transited from international to international twice and the waiting time was close to 3 hours both ways. With just 1 or 2 officers serving the line (and for certain intervals none at all as the officers led passengers to secondary) of up to 500 arriving foreigners it was pure agony to see the time tick away realizing soon our connections would be lost. The foreigners section is shared with the wheelchair passengers and I have never seen so many wheelchair passengers in my life, only when those lines clear an additional officer will serve the waiting foreigners. The previously installed machines where you would do your passport reading, photo and fingerprints are gone, so that option of - sort of - fast tracking is no longer available. And mind you, we are still far away from pre-covid travel volumes. I can only imagine what the situation will be like further in the season. Oh and one more thing, customs is also gone, so that saves you some time. My advice: do not plan any connections under 5 hours. Apart from this, I find DFW a pleasant airport, once you are airside things are spacious, calm and organized. Retail wasn't quite fully operational but the offer seems solid. I especially like entering through the B-terminal that is small scale, with quick and easy security. Once you are in you can reach every terminal quick and easy using the train. Entering the USA as a foreigner has always been hit or miss depending on travel volumes but I would stay away from DFW at this time.",-1,DFW

I'm not fussed on all the opportunities for shopping personally, I just want to be able to get through the airport quickly and efficiently. This airport seems designed to keep you trapped inside. Not only is it badly designed from an architectural and passenger processing standpoint, TSA and US Customs checkpoints will take over an hour to pass through without fail. I highly recommend if you arrive at this airport to expect a 2 hour wait to clear customs. If you are departing, expect 1 hour delay for the TSA.",-1,DFW

Worst airport ever. If you want WiFi, you need to pass security first before access it. Immigration is even very long and not so many immigration counters were open. Baggage delivery was also very poor. Airport was also less cleaned. I believe American standards has been in decline for a long time. JAL service was also bad much as this airport too. The next time when I travel, I will try my best to never fly through this airport again and I will also avoid flying JAL and next time, I will fly another airlines like Emirates, Qatar etc when flying from Indonesia.",-1,DFW

I flew in to Memphis, TN from Dallas, and they lost my baggage and wasn’t aware I made it to Memphis last night. There is literally a computer system tracking where the passenger is going and it wasn’t applied. I had to get a BSO attendant in Memphis to call the BSO in Dallas just so the attendant can put my bag on the plane herself. I have military clothing and items in my bag that are irreplaceable. I have my moms wedding where I walk her down the aisle and I haven't prepped my uniform. The early flight was going to Memphis and arrive at 10am its 11am now and got put on the second flight. Do your job! Somebody please brief sternly to the workers because they are subpar in their only job to put a bag on an airplane. Its not rocket science. Anybody viewing this review make sure you keep your bags with you. You cannot trust the simplistic worker. I even confirm with my AA representative that my bag was put in the plane and she said yes.

I landed in terminal C. I took an A & B bus trying to get to B6 where my car was parked. The bus went to A first and everyone got off except me. I said that I needed to go to B and he said to get on the bus behind him and that it was going to B. I got on the 2nd B & D bus and it went B first. It stopped at the first B stop for the higher numbered gates. He told me that my stop was next. After a few minutes of winding roads, I asked him if he skipped my B6 stop. He said, oh, yes I did. I had to travel on to D and then get on a 3rd bus that took me back to B. It took me 1 hour to get from terminal C to my car that was parked in terminal B! What a cluster.

It's a cesspool of disease and rude people without masks. My 11 month old can't wear a mask. He relies on others to follow and enforce the rules and they failed him.

2021-08-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,never coming back to this airport,True,"  I'm never coming back to this airport if I can help it.  Even a 4-5 hour layover might be cutting it close. The TSA here are the worst people I've ever encountered in air travel.  First time through TSA they not only rescanned my bag 3 times, but over 20+ people were waiting for their bags to be checked/rescanned. TSA agents kept saying that the picture was cut off and they were only allowed to rescan the tray. Hand checking not allowed. I suggested after the 3rd re-scan attempt, if they could please separate the tray as it seemed it being overloaded was causing issues with the scanner or if they could use another x ray machine. The TSA agent looked at me and said that was not possible and that the only way was to rescan it...again. I repeated myself because I just couldn't believe they didn't understand what I was saying, that the tray was too full and it might be better to split it into two trays. He took that as aggression and in turn chose to escalate the situation by saying ""you keep repeating yourself"" in a certain tone. Unfortunately, people need to repeat themselves when the other person doesn't understand a simple question. Not my fault you don't have basic comprehension skills. I noticed that there was a lady that seemed to be the head and I politely asked her if it was possible to split my tray up next time it comes up to be scanned. She reluctantly agreed. And it went through. Something that could have been resolved immediately with what you would assume be experience and knowledge doing the job. 45 mins of waiting around for that. Anyway, the skytram sucks. It takes about 30 mins or more to get to another terminal. The airport is so large, yet disorganized you really have to know where you're going if you want to make your connecting flight. On the way back from my trip, we got delayed (again because of how disorganized DFW operations is) and only had 40 mins to make it to our connecting flight in another terminal. TSA was NOT helpful in getting us expedited through security although it we were not at fault for the rush. I've seen other airports rush connecting flights through TSA if they were pressed for time, but they did not care at all. I asked the TSA agent at TSA precheck if he could please let us through so we can make our connecting flight, he said no. I then said what do you expect me to do to make this flight, and he said I needed to get in line or ask the 300+ people waiting in the security line to cut in front. So I did exactly that. I turned around to the line of 300+ people and yelled ""I apologize, but this TSA agent won't let me pass through without asking all of you if it's ok to cut in line, again I apologize but my connecting flight leaves in 30mins and I wont make it if I can't cut right now"" No one objected and I went through. No thanks to TSA.",-1,DFW

I checked in no line the lady at the checkin for flight was rude had a attitude ask her question she almost screamed. Security was worse like you were wasting their time.

2021-07-12,0.3,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,3.0,There is no meaningful signage,False,"  I will never use this airport for arrivals or departures again. It took over an hour after we landed to get my luggage. And then it took about 30 minutes to get to the car rental terminal. In order to go back to the airport to pick up my family flying in on a different flight, I found I needed to know exactly which gate they were arriving into. That meant I had to wait for them to land and get off the plane. My plan was to park and go inside to help them with their luggage and the babies. But since I had no idea where to go before they landed, I barely was able to even get to the correct terminal and gate before they were trying to collect baggage by themselves - 2 babies and a mom. There is no meaningful signage to direct a person to car rental return location. And I asked 3 different employees how to get there - 2 Terminal Link drivers and a TSA agent who just happened to be on his lunch break, thank goodness. The 2 Terminal Link drivers had no idea. The TSA agent said he was pretty sure I would have to exit the airport then turn around. He thought the car rental return location was only outside the airport. Considering I had been driving around for what seemed like a lifetime, I did as he recommended. But the signs only said “rentals,” not “car rental return.” I followed this sign and ended up in front of the car rental terminal, not the right place. At first the Hertz agents tried to direct me to get back in their vehicle and drive somewhere else. I lost it. The agents then whispered to themselves - probably deciding if they needed the men to bring the white suits - but then one of them agreed to look at the vehicle and drive it to the correct location herself. I can’t say how much I appreciated that, I was so supremely frustrated at that point. But, seriously, never again will I put myself through this frustration.",-1,DFW

We went back to get our Boarding passes (with missed flight time) went BACK to TSA and in their words they didn’t wanna deal with that situation and we could not even go back inside with the only boarding passes we had at the moment.

When we got into the airport from the plane I had to get out of my chair and onto some kind of cart with 3 bench seats on each side. It was difficult stepping up onto the step to the bench seat. The seat was very narrow and did not have adequate hand holds. The driver was very curt and drove too fast for the amount of walking people, weaving around and making it hard to stay on the bench without sliding around. We arrived at an elevator and he told us to get off and go down and another cart would be waiting. We had to get off the cart and on to another cart. Then that driver did the same thing to us. Made us wait for another cart. Then a third cart arrived. At that point we chose not to get on that cart. I walked very slowly to our gate which thankfully wasn't very far. When someone needs a wheelchair it's because they can't walk far or not at all or their mobility is compromised. After we boarded our flight to Kona we had to exit the plane due to an electrical problem. When I exited the plane I told a flight attendant I needed a wheelchair. I waited outside the door for awhile and another attendant told me I needed to go back to the gate. I told her I needed a wheelchair. I ended up walking again back up the ramp where we waited 2 hours while the plane was being repaired. One of the gate attendants came and apologized and said they haven't been able to hire enough people. This was the worst experience I've had at any airport since I have had to use a wheelchair when flying.",-1,DFW

Additionally, the layout of the taxiway caused another delay as the aircraft in front of ours was unable to move and we could not manoeuvre around. Inside the airport, however, was a different story. The SkyTrain was very quick and easy to access. We were in our departure terminal within minutes. The food options were quite diverse. Terminal C featured a TGI Friday, Chick-fil-a, Auntie Annie's, Pizza Hut, and McDonald's. I had never seen this many chain brands at an airport and was satisfied with the choices. Power outlets were available at certain spots, and some seats had footrests, which I have never seen before. The airport has good wifi and all other necessities needed even for a long layover, if you had to have a connection, I would definitely recommend this airport.",1,DFW

I observed another lady quite upset, after handling my issue, which was resolved quite adequately. I went over to the station where the lady was in distress. I asked the agent, what was the issue, and if the lady needed help. The lady could only speak Spanish, and crying so it was hard for the agent to get at the crux of her problem. After sorting it out, she didn't have the funds to get a new COVID test for entrance into Guatemala, (Guatemala has changed their requirements). Anyway, the agent was very compassionate and spent as much time as needed to explain and help her to understand what she needed. I had inquired if I could help, some things, of course, could not be corrected by me, but this situation. I could help. She just needed money for the test. The American Agent, explained in Spanish to the lady and that I was going to help her with the funds.

Our carry on was flagged, the only thing that was in it was an Aero bed (an electric inflatable air mattress). Funny how we had no problem with it going through security for our previous flight a few hours earlier. 4 of your TSA workers thought it was a big joke that we were going to miss our flight because no one was there to check bags that had been set aside and were having a great time laughing and joking instead of actually working. Loved how our suitcase was manhandled when finally checked, and when we arrived at our destination after two flights, driving, being up all day and helping family pack up their belongings in preparing to move in the morning, our bed which we planned to sleep on tonight won’t hold air.

Now the flight from Sydney gets in at 1pm so the customs and immigration formalities are completely painless (usually). That means straight to the machines, swipe the passport and check finger prints and to the usually very pleasant (he was) officer who asks purpose of visit. Being a regular visitor and departing on time always, this is a cursory look and smile. From departing the aircraft to pulling up at a local airport hotel took all of 45 minutes. Now compare to LAX. Terminal D is my departure point also. Now being dropped off at the curb to entering the terminal proper via a check in and TSA process took all of 10 minutes. A big thank you to the Qantas desk for the upgrade. The TSA checks were painless. You just have to know what to take off (shoes, belt, bulky clothing) or out (personal toiletries, laptop) or leave behind (water). Folks it is not that hard. Just know the system and its absolutely fine. The TSA have a job to to so work with them. Terminal D is a fine place. Very large and lot of places to eat and sit. One thing I think a terminal of this size needs is a decent bookstore. There used to be one but now has become very small and added to a coffee shop. I dont eat in the terminal as I have lounge access but plenty of choice. A trip to 7/11 to load up on snacks. The WiFi in terminal is fine also. Superb experience all round at DFW.",1,DFW

Statistically, there's a certain number of bags that need to be reviewed manually. This airport took every other back out and hand searched it. There were probably 30 people waiting for their bags to be manually searched after already waiting in the security like for 1hr + (some with flights about to leave). When they took out my liquids (which were correctly packaged and had previously gone through Logan's airport security no problem) they slammed the ziploc on the counter, broke a couple of products inside of the bag and as I'm trying to put the products into the bag they provided, they are yelling at me telling me I need to move quicker going as far as taking products out of my hand and forcibly grabbing the bag out of my had and shoving the open bag in my carry on where the broken product then spilled all over the contents of said carry on. I have never been treated this way going through security. Definitely the worst airport experience I have ever had.",-1,DFW
2020-01-08,0.6,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,a great and frustrating airport,True," I don't know how many times I've flown into and out, and transited through, DFW in the last several years. I semi-joke that one has to transit through DFW to get to either Heaven or Hell, as one can easily see all walks of life represented in the customers in this airport. Heck, I even saw Trace Adkins (American country music star) standing around one time. But honestly, DFW is a great and frustrating airport simultaneously, I like it, but I neither love nor hate it. Despite its size, the terminals are all very well connected by a very modern tram, and are very modern and clean, yet each terminal feels like it's the size of the City of Fort Worth and often requires much walking once in the terminal. For another catch, the personnel in this airport lean toward the friendly side overall, but you never know if you're going to catch that one airline staff member who just enjoys barking at their customers (I'm looking at you, American Airlines!), or that one TSA officer who can't get over their breakup with their significant other last month. Personnel are either very helpful, or have the worst attitudes, and there isn't a lot of in-between. Aesthetically, this airport provides a beautiful, spacious, ""Texas-sized"" introduction to visitors to Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas, and the USA altogether. However, while signage anywhere you need to go within the terminals and around the airport property is ample, it can still be a chore to finally reach the always-slow baggage claim, then the car rental facility, or light rail (again, because of those long tram rides and long walks to anywhere). Lastly, as this airport is in the Dallas area, there's usually either a pushy nouveau-riche soccer mom or a testosterone-fueled redneck who doesn't travel much, who is impatiently trying to push ahead of other people in the airport, whether to order a burger, check a bag, or get on the plane. Something about Dallas, I tell you. This airport does much to make you go, ""Wow!"", before rendering you with such a mixed reaction.",1,DFW
2020-01-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,,,1.0,you either get barked at or mumbled at,True," I am so sick of TSA agents acting like they’re not employees. No one is on the same page, you either get barked at or mumbled at, and I find it annoying when they won’t even address you. A woman tried to move me through security with her eyes and then got upset when I wasn’t following her non verbal cues. However, I noticed she had no trouble speaking clearly to the gentleman after me or in assisting him with luggage retrieval. Please stop acting like your agents priorities are safety (it would be one thing if they actually took care of that), they are, instead, simply rude and this bunch would rather be surly, roll their eyes, and not speak or direct traffic. Even another agent was having trouble getting an answer from agents who were clearly new and didn’t know what they were doing during screening. Dallas Love is miles better.",-1,DFW
2019-12-22,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,airport is very unclean,False,  This airport is very unclean. I understand it’s hard to clean an airport that has flights going in and out 24/7 but Mccarran Airport in Vegas probably has close to the same volume of people and manages to keep the place spotless. These people with the cleaning carts just aimlessly walk around and don’t make an effort. Cleanliness should be a top priority.,-1,DFW

I’ve been all over the place and seen a lot of rude TSA individuals, however this bunch really have it down to a science. They were absolutely the most unfriendly group of agents that I’ve ever seen. This must be where TSA sends the most crotchety agents to retire. “Get your tickets out, we’re not standing here making you sandwiches!”, exclaimed the TSA jerk in the middle of the line. The only individual not barking orders was the drug sniffing dog. Truly a horrible representation of the airport and the US. I will never go through Dallas-Fort Worth again. They need to fix that bunch.",-1,DFW
2019-11-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,signs are horribly inaccurate,False," The signs are horribly inaccurate and don’t represent actual roads. I went to parking for Terminal E for gate 13 and it shows 4 roads, with the left lane-splitting into parking with a big P for gates 1-10 and 11-38. There are 3 roads. So I took the left lane that splits off into two roads and stayed on the right. Nope, apparently you take the middle lane and just stay there. Makes zero sense. Whoever mapped out these signs has a horrible sense of understanding what a person who is driving for the first time will choose when the sign shows essentially 4 paths but there are only 3, and the left lane states parking but you have to go in the middle lane.",-1,DFW

The baggage handling process at DFW is by far, the worst I’ve experienced, slow, priority bags processed like all others, inaccurate scanning, etc. Here’s the problem, there is nothing you can do about it!

2019-10-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,it utterly failed,True," This was my first experience with this airport. For a first impression, it utterly failed. It needs better signage. That would have completely altered this entire experience for the better. I tried parking in remote parking. I got turned around, twice, and was lucky it was not more. Remote parking is remote. Not quite Timbuktu, but by the time you figure out the signs, it feels similar. I ended up parking in the south remote parking. When I took the exit, there was a T in the road, and there was a sign that said this road this way, that road that way, and absolutely nothing about where I might find remote parking. Seriously. Nothing. I turned the wrong way, because I am an idiot sometimes, and Murphy has a law. Then the shuttle dropped me off at an elevator for E33 instead of E12. There was no signage for E12 anywhere. He said to go up the elevator and down the hall because he doesn’t stop down there. So I ran half a mile after the kiosk didn’t work (add on to all this I was later than planned, so couldn’t check-in at the kiosk to print my pass), and kept having to ask where it was I was going, as there were still no signs. I got my boarding pass and tried to find the right security. Those also are not signed. They make their employees answer the same questions all day every day from clueless people like me. I felt horrible. Angry (at myself and them). Frustrated. So frustrated. Stupid. Because DFW failed to properly communicate. They made it so difficult to have a smooth, calming experience. As a result, it shall take me a considerable amount of time to get this taste out of my mouth. Perhaps it will leave when they improve the usability of their signage. It would be such a simple fix! Until then, I shall try to find some redeeming quality. My fellow passengers seem nice. The sun is rising now, which looks quite beautiful. The temperature in here also seems decent. And there’s a pretty piece of bubble-like artwork at my gate that does a nice job of catching the eye.",-1,DFW
2019-10-08,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,,3.0,4.0,,1.0,3.0,take lessons from functional airports,True, It’s my 3rd airport today and I wish Texas could take lessons from functional airports. Having to go completely out of the secure area to go back through sub-par security to catch a connection is bad. It’s the only airport that doesn’t allow water - most airports do a water check. Also where it eventually brings you up to enter they closed that station so we had to walk even further. After 3 flights in 12 hours it was aggravating. After using free WiFi today out of the country - I tried here to answer the survey. No go. Couldn’t connect obviously strings attached for free. It should be simple so foreigners can connect without needing to read in English.,-1,DFW
2019-08-14,1.0,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,a great place to arrive and depart from,True," There are so many negative reviews abut DFW that I wonder whether I'm at the same airport as some of those reviewers. It may be the other terminals are more perfunctory than Terminal D, international. In many trips through DFW I have not encountered a problem save the occasional wait at TSA security. Arrivals are a walk in the park. Like all security the world around, it becomes easy if you simply take your time, remove everything and just do what you are expected to do. No shouting or anger on either side. The food outlets in D are great although I have lounge access and so generally eat there. One thing missing is a good bookshop but that is being renovated and should be around soon. Compared to LAX and JFK, DFW is a paradise and in my view comparable to places like Changi and Hong Kong but without the crowds. What could be improved: DFW operator, please please put in a decent coffee shop so we don't have to put up with the brown stuff that masquerades as coffee. Otherwise a great place to arrive and depart from.",1,DFW
2019-07-31,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,a courteous manner costs nothing,True, I recently experienced one of the most aggressive and rude security experiences in all of my visits to the USA. I beeped coming through security and she yelled step out I didn’t understand so she got very loud and then yelled at my 14yr old who she had told to come through! I spoke to a supervisor but he also looked terrified of her. Such a shame when I had such a great impression of Dallas and Texans to have left under such a cloud. I fully understand that you are trying to keep people safe but a courteous manner costs nothing - not good to encourage visitors to Dallas area! So disappointing.,-1,DFW
2019-07-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,an extremely rude and overtly condescending manner,True," My flight was delayed due to an emergency on the runway, that’s fine, I know stuff happens and there is no one at fault. I was flying into Dallas to transit for out of country travel. Anyways, due to the emergency, I missed my connecting flight out of country. American Airlines gave me a hotel for the night and rescheduled my flight for the following day. I lost my scheduled car rental day, hotel and a tour on my first day of vacation. After I returned to customer service post-trip, I tried to talk with one of the reps and was given some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Any question I had without hesitation was met with a head shake under the dismissal of “we don’t take care of that, headquarters does”. This was done in an extremely rude and overtly condescending manner. It’s fine if there’s nothing to do, but at least offer some alternatives and don’t make the customers pull teeth to find out information. I will not likely be recommending American to any of my friends or family.",1,DFW

I was waiting for 30 minutes for an oversized item to be delivered through the baggage claim, while the baggage handler walked around aimlessly. When I went to the desk to ask where my baggage was because I was going to my miss my connecting flight, the gentleman at the desk went and checked and turned out the conveyor was not turned off, and asked the moping rock head why it was turned off he just shrugged his shoulders like the neanderthal he is.

The American Airlines terminal there was disgusting. It was a Tuesday morning and the restrooms in the A10 terminal waiting area were filthy with hair and faeces on the floor. The boarding/waiting area carpet was loaded with trash, spilled drinks and pieces of food on chair seats and carpet. We did not see any person in the act of cleaning anywhere nearby.

The AA desk was empty. Then the TSA lady at check-in was rude and unfriendly complaining to her colleague next to her how she disliked her job as she checked my pass. The TSA staff at the scanners gave little guidance and talked over me. I rarely travel by plane and this experience was terrible.,-1,DFW

I had to run across the whole airport myself to find it! The airport staff instructed me to exit through a set of doors and ensured that I’d be allowed back inside, which I was not. So I had to wait for my parents to arrive for 3 hours outside the airport. The American Airlines staff and baggage claim staff were as rude as could be as I kept my cool and was polite through the whole situation. Avoid if you can!",-1,DFW

We were told the only security gate that was open was the one that opened at 4:30 am. We then all missed our flight due to not getting through security in time. We are now all on standby for the next flight. Spending $1000 on a cruise out of Miami might not even happen now and will all go down the drain. Worst experience of my life. Really upsetting.,-1,DFW
2019-05-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,the worst experience I have had at DFW airport,False,"  Upon arrival at airport the instructions on the plane say to sign into mobile passport for faster customs checks. So we did this and have used these services before with no problems. We went to the line mobile passport just to be put in line with everyone else. Then moved to another line with even slower service. When the staff was asked why the mobile passport people had to go through the line. Nobody would answer the question and just say to stay right here. After getting through the line, I found another staff member and asked him the same question and he said ""just keep walking good bye"". So with no answer how am I suppose to know what to do next time. As an American citizen we are being led around by people that cant understand nor hold a conversation in English. We fly have flown American Airlines for a long time but things need to be corrected. I will be doing some comparisons with Southwest from now on. I dont normally leave reviews but this evening 5/16/19 coming in on AA1385 was the worst experience I have had at DFW airport.",-1,DFW

The automated system is marshalled by staff, many of whom can't speak English and those that do don't have a clue what is going on. When you finally clear the automated stuff you then queue for ages and then do the same stuff over with a over officious ""guard""who is basically a little man in an important uniform. Very rude. Whilst this long protracted chaos is unfolding they are playing on a loop a glossy video saying how welcome you are. Well it doesn't feel like it. Then comes the chaos of the bag reclaim you have been in security so long there are numerous flights per carousel and no indication of which one your bags may be on. The staff are generally lazy, non English speakers, unclear of what is going on and/or downright rude. Avoid this place if you can.",-1,DFW

The dog sniffer ran into me twice. I waited 10 minutes to have my bag checked. The lady who was supposed to be waving me through the metal detector treated the foreigners in front of me like animals. She was waving at them so indignantly I was horrified. I bet she would have reacted violently if someone had done that to her. Then, on our way to the gate, my friend was almost run over by the vehicle transporting people. To top it all off, they were broadcasting CNN. Give me a break!",-1,DFW

There were approximately 400 people in the immigration area trying to get through three lines. TSA was a joke, very disorganized, slow, and TSA people standing around doing nothing. We were able to get through a TSA check at ORD quicker with three times the number of people in line on our way to Mexico. My husband waited 10+ minutes for someone to go through his bag, as it needed extra checking. We arrived at our gate to find to doors already closed. We were put on standby for the next/last flight to Chicago. There were 34 people on standby for that flight. My family did get to fly home that night but shame on American for overbooking all three of my flights on this trip.",-1,DFW

We entered through A15. As we walked up to the door, we were met by an overwhelming sewage stench. Once through the door, we saw people asleep on the chairs (one man with his pants down to his knees, thankfully, he was wearing underwear) and on the floor, they had been there for awhile. I don't think they were passengers, as they were far removed from baggage claim and ticketing. As far as I know, there was no weather - or airline-related reason for people to be sleeping in the terminal. My daughter reports that the sewage stench is prevalent at her gate (A15), so this isn't just an isolated situation. What's the deal, DFW? The airport suffers from lax housekeeping in general, but this is a whole different level of ick. Are the homeless allowed to sleep in the terminals? Is someone on the sewage thing?

I fly weekly and have never experienced the attitude like they have at DFW. I walked through security 1/28 – 7.44pm – Term A Gate 22 and asked about the new luggage bin system because I’ve never seen it. Security smarts off that it’s been here for a year and I need to fly more to be aware, unreal, then he continued to laugh and repeat to other flyers that I need to become more aware.

Driving to and from this airport is like getting castration without pain killer, every time. Just when you thought you're learned this atrocity they throw you a new curve. One time all roads and lanes to the airport were blocked, and no detour signs anywhere. Apparently we were supposed to leave our cars there at the barricades and walk to the airport, in the dark at 4:30 am. Yesterday I was picking passenger at terminal A. To get there I needed to go through parking garage?! Next, due to so much traffic at the curb side, and being night time, I didn't see my party after driving the entire length of the terminal A. I figured I'll just take the ""exit"" sign and loop around. Wrong, this took me clear out of the airport. As I was paying my toll and bitching to the attendant he told me I could take the immediate first left turn and go back in. OK, fine - except - I was at the stop sign and needed to cross 20 lanes of onrushing cars to get to the rightmost lanes on the entry side - the ones for people paying cash. I was never this scared - absolutely the worst, most retarded, demented architecture and infrastructure on this planet. Third world airports are better and easier to navigate.

We arrived from Jamaica and went through the customs process where we told a customs agent that we were going to miss our connection. There were six of us so she said there’s too many of you to let you in front of others and because there are so many of you they will hold the plane. Needless to say they did not and of course the airline did nothing to help us blaming a customs issue. Sadly this is not the first time I have missed a connecting international flight due to customs.

Both my husband and I have travelled and flown quite a bit, but this was personally my first time flying through DFW and never, I repeat, never again! I usually fly Southwest because I love them as an airline and have always had great experiences with them, well to save on flights this time I chose American which meant flying out of DFW instead of Dallas Love. I’ll try to make this review as short as I can, but no guarantees considering the entire trip was horrible. First: Our flight left at 05.15 which meant boarding around 04.45. We got to the airport around 03.30. We had two children (2 years and 7 months) with us. Pretty sure there was only one counter area open that was checking bags. Thankfully though, we made it through there relatively quickly. Next is security/TSA. They didn’t even open their lines until almost 04.00. Okay, not a big deal, we were TSA precheck so still would have plenty of time. Nope. No TSA precheck open. So we had to go into the normal lane which was very long. Again, no big deal, we all have flights and we should be able to get through pretty quick, right? Nope. They had one, I repeat, one person checking IDs for both general and priority lines. One flipping person that was also taking her merry little time and then they had one line open to go through the security and have bags scanned for 2 long lines of people. Holy hell did we all barely move. Around 04.30-04.40 they finally started opening up TSA precheck line. We asked if we could jump to that line since we were TSA precheck. We were literally ignored and they walked by and let another long line of people come up and start through their line. We even had people in front of us asking if they would make their flights on time because they were needing to get to their gates for boarding. And they were ignored. Okay, now let’s jump to when we finally got up to go through security (around 04.40 when we needed to be boarding at 04.45): again, it’s me my husband and our two kids. Took forever to even get us through the scanners. We get through the metal detectors and now we have to wait for our bags and car seat. TSA pulls every one of our bags for a check. It’s probably because of the formula and kids snacks. Nope. They wiped everything down and then told us they had to open every single one of our ready to feed formulas to make sure they were actually formula. The formula was still sealed! And if you are at all familiar with RTF formula, once opened it goes to a short expiration date. So all of our formula for the trip now was being moved to a 24-48 hour expiration date assuming our cold packs kept the cooler cold enough, if it didn’t, they put all of our formula expiration to 1 hour. It’s not like we could find formula around the airport for him if he gets hungry since our formula is no longer good because you had to break all the seals! So here we are getting progressively more and more angry as we are also supposed to be boarding our flight at the other end of the airport. So I take the kids and start heading/running down to our gate while my husband waits for them to finish opening all of our formula up. We literally get to the gate as the last people to board. Never again!",-1,DFW

When we reached the podium my husband began to follow me and the TSA agent yelled at him saying ""sir! Nuh uh one at a time!"" I told her he was my husband and I had both our boarding passes on my phone. She asked a second time. ""So you're together?"" When I nodded she said, ""Fine then scan it."" I scanned mine then went to show her his she again scolded again and said ""give me your thing"" in a hurried tone. I made a guess that she wanted my ID and I gave my ID slowly and at this point very irritatedly. She was rude and irritated at us. I've been flying frequently for work for a year now and getting through security does not require this level of power-tripping rudeness.",-1,DFW

",True," Finding the DART station for a train to downtown Dallas is confusing. I followed signs to “ground transportation” and was directed to a jitney and told to go to terminal A. The jitney driver was extremely unprofessional, did not announce information about stops, and yelled at me when I got off at the wrong terminal A stop. I was the only passenger boarding the train, which comes as no surprise given the difficulty in finding the train. Returning to the airport, I learned from another passenger that I could enter the airport at the train station and take the skylink to my terminal. Why isn’t skylink connection to DART listed clearly in airport signage? It is no wonder few people seem to take DART to downtown!",-1,DFW

2018-10-19,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,,difficult to find two seats,True," Long lines at both standard and Pre-check lines in terminal C. This apparently was due to construction. It seems as if it could have been planned better. The pre-check line spilled out of the queuing area halfway down the hall. Signage to get to the proper line was poor and required asking directions of personnel rather than simply following the signs. Despite arriving at the gate over an hour and a half early, it was difficult to find two seats together for my wife and I. I would not say that the airport was filthy but it certainly does not look as if it has been cleaned up, particularly in the gate areas.",-1,DFW

They were super efficient in retrieving it. Thank you too to the airline staff at a nearby counter who suggested airport police. By then I had tried the cleaning team, the lost property at several terminals, my own airline (who was boarding), and security. The staff suggested not to call the regular police but gave me the airport police number instead. The bag held my passport, airport police had recorded it but not paged me or liased with other departments, despite jet-lag memory fail I made my flight thanks to regular staff and am very grateful! PS Security trainee here gives overzealous pat downs as if ensuring all crevices are airtight and flightworthy. Avoid at all costs.",1,DFW
2018-09-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Worst airport I've been to,False,  Worst airport I've ever been to. Myself and a few others missed our flight because the airport concierge told us the directions to the wrong gate when I showed him our itineraries. We then proceeded to ask for help and no one that worked there would help us and talked to us like they had no clue as to what needed to be done to get another flight out. Have to purchase another plane ticket out for three days from now. Also extremely hard to navigate this airport. Even the parking lot attendant gave me wrong directions on how to get out of the airport! Extremely dissatisfied. Won't refund my money and was charged for my bags that I had to wind up carrying the entire time!,-1,DFW
2018-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,confusing to navigate,False,"  This is absolutely the worst airport I’ve ever had to use. It’s very difficult and confusing to navigate, directional signs inside and out are extremely vague. Decided to use valet parking because I was traveling with children and I had a broken arm. Valet is a joke! Made a valet reservation on the app and selected “yes” for the baggage assistance option. Pulled up to valet, was just stared at for a few seconds so I parked my own car! Then when I mentioned help with my luggage, the guy acted like he’d never heard of such a thing and asked what I wanted him to do because I’m just going “right there” as he pointed across the way to the airport! So not only did I have park my own car, but I had to trek the exact same distance as I would have if I just opted for self parking, and I’m trying to hold onto kids and drag a 50 lb suitcase to the terminal with a broken arm!! All while being charged $31/day! Upon return, my car had never even been moved. This lack of service cost me a total of $205! Someone please explain to me how this is valet? Contacted customer service, the guy said he couldn’t help me but would pass this on to his manager and she would call me back that day, that was four days ago. Regardless of the valet issue, DFW is awful, majority of employees I’ve encountered are rude, and everything about the airport makes travel very stressful. Dalas Love Field airport is my preference. Everything is easy and flows so smoothly there and all areas of customer service are wonderful!",-1,DFW
2018-07-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,2.0,Process improvement needed desperately,False,"  Entering from Europe with Mobile Pass. Supposed to be quicker than other options. Not here. Process was painful with those that were in charge of the lines and no throughput ideas. The Mobile Pass line was the slowest, when we finally got to the immigration officer he asked us for our passports. I thought the idea was ""mobile"" passport. I did not see why he needed to check these with as other cities do not. He also was very nice but painfully slow with chit chat. We were trying to make a connecting flight and wanted to just get they immigration. Those in charge need dedicated Mobile Pass lanes. There were families leaving Mobile Pass and going into the kiosk lanes as those moved quicker. Process improvement needed desperately.",-1,DFW
2018-06-10,0.5,Business,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,very difficult to navigate,False,"  This airport is very difficult to navigate. The bathrooms smell and appear to never be cleaned beyond wiping the countertop and the toilets. The rental car return is beyond confusing. On the way to return my car I passed two areas for my rental agency that we’re not for the return. It is disorganized chaos, but it does have a great app that helps you to navigate the airport and track flights. Also there is only one area with tsa pre check in each terminal so regardless of where you think your gate is, you will likely have to trek to a different area to use pre check.",-1,DFW
2018-05-12,0.2,Business,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,the most poorly organized airport,True," Perhaps the most poorly organized airport I have ever been to, and that includes airports from countries in the third world. Everyone knows TSA is slow, but at DFW they take that already high standard and push it even higher. The lines are abysmal. Worry not - staff seems well aware, and they try to speed up the lines by frequently redirecting passengers to other lines. This is where my negative experience begins. A lady in Orange redirected about the last 30 if us to ""TSA Pre-Check"", verbatim. ""Go down the hall to TSA Pre-Check"", she said. A a result we all moseyed our way down to the pre-check line and the line was not short, but it was moving unlike the previous one (when a line doesn't move for 15 min, something is wrong). Those in the group told to move all waited at pre-check until we were at the very front, and only then did a man start yelling at folks that the line was for ""TSA Pre-Check only"", when the lady in Orange clearly told us to wait in that line. Nevertheless we were all relocated to yet another endlessly long line. No signs to mark the line, no staff to usher people to the proper line, and no announcements were made at the appropriate time. As you can guess, many of us missed our flights as a result. This is my second negative experience at DFW, and the reason I felt compelled to leave a review. Everyone understands that security takes time, however DFW abuses that understanding greatly. Sadly one doesn't have much of a choice when choosing an airport , but I'd avoid DFW if given the option. It's not the amount of people that's the issue, it's the rate that they process those people and apparent lack of organization/communication. So congrats DFW, to being one of the largest, and most poorly operated airports in the world.",-1,DFW
2018-05-09,0.2,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,no soap in the bathrooms,False," What’s going on with the Gate 26 area? No food, no drinks and no soap in the bathrooms! Are you closing this area? How about a sign near the other gates that once you come over here you will have nothing. Thanks Dallas - one of the largest airports in the world. Unbelievable!",1,DFW
2018-05-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,,,,1.0,this one is by far the worst,True,"  Of all the airports I've been in, this one is by far the worst! 5 terminals spread out over an unbelievable amount of land, signs that lead you in one direction only to stop giving you directions, and, above all extremely rude staff. Rental car return area is a 2-3 mile bus ride, understaffed, and again, extremely rude. People driving the busses both to and from the terminals didn't speak very good English, and though I tried to explain that I was leaving out of terminal B, was assured that the terminal E bus would get me there as he took my bag and loaded it - it didn't go to B. No one at terminals to help. Ended up paying a shuttle driver $40 to take me to B. One TSA check point for 30 or 40 gates, combined with bad information, almost caused me to miss my flight even though I pulled in to car return 2 hours before my flight was scheduled. The sign that led to nowhere led me to a door that said ""no re-entry"" once you pass through. I opened the door and stuck my head out to see where I was only to yelled at by a security lady. She threatened me stating I had to come on out even though my entire body (minus my head) was still inside the door. When I tried to ask where I needed to be the yelling got worse. To the point she threatened to have me arrested if I didn't come on through. I've never been treated as rudely at an airport as I was at this one. Never again will I use this airport.",-1,DFW

2018-04-16,0.4,Business,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,,dirty and poorly maintained,False,"  Terminal is dirty and poorly maintained. Escalator was broken and some lethargically applied signage confused the passengers about how to navigate. Overall signage approaching the airport is terrible, especially the rental car return route. Signs have you exiting one stop prior to when you should for rental car return. Rental car shuttles are too long between busses. No excuse for the place being dirty though.",-1,DFW
2018-04-15,0.5,Business,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,saw them being rude to several passengers,True," I passed thru Dallas Forth Worth in transit to Mexico City for an international legal conference and must say that I agree with others regarding the confusion that initially greets international travelers when one arrives here! The support staff do not appear to have any clue of what they are doing and I saw them being rude to several passengers. On the plus side, the immigration and customs guys were great and professional though the lines were long as they had only three counters open to cope with many passengers who were arriving through several flights. I am not sure why they could not open more counters. It was worse on return. Coming back from Mexico, all of us missed the connecting flight to Doha as the lines were even longer, thanks to the American Airlines officer at the airlines desk counter, she managed to get us on the next day direct flight to Doha. My question is as to why transit passengers who do not wish to enter the US are not processed quicker and without needing to go out of the airport, like in most other international airports? I had an entry visa but was not intending to enter the US at all. This would simplify matters really.",-1,DFW

Then you are treated like criminals by very nasty employees who do not know what they are doing and should not be employed in those positions as they kept sending people to the wrong lines causing more delay and problems to the arriving passengers, with a lot of them missing their connecting flights. Then your are forced to exit the security area and go again through security to get to your connecting flight. I hope the management of the international arrival at terminal D look at this and try to improve the service which on March 12 was a real disaster and nightmare. I have been in business more than 40 years with many employees, if I see any employee of mine treating the customers the way the arriving passenger were treate , I would fire them on the spot together with the manager.",-1,DFW

Im not happy paying almost $800 for a round trip ticket and I'm sitting here in the airport for another 4 hours before I can leave. This is the third time this has happened to me in this airport. Delayed for 4 more hours. How much money do you people think we have to spend at the airport to arrive at are destination on time? I feel like they do it to make more money when they have plenty of it. I'm not happy at all with the service.,-1,DFW
2018-01-12,0.9,Business,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,one of the easiest airports for connections,True," I fly weekly for business, and for the past year I've been flying on American from Michigan to California. I connect semi-regularly through DFW - makes sense, as it's American's headquarters and largest hub. I'll say right here that I love connecting through DFW. It is one of the easiest airports for connections that I've ever experienced. The concourses are wide and open, seldom choked by clusters of boarding passengers. The physical layout of the concourses minimizes the need for airplanes to wait on the tarmac ""for traffic to clear the alley,"" as happens at other airports like O'Hare. Best of all, the SkyTrain at DFW absolutely flies, and can connect you from one corner of the airport to the farthest other corner in about 9 minutes. I'll accept a tighter connect at DFW than I will almost anywhere else, because of that SkyTrain. Dining at DFW is varied and generally good. B Terminal is a little skimpy, but otherwise I have no complaints. Restrooms are generally large enough for the number of travelers, and generally clean. I've had loo-oong layovers, and have walked the entirety of all terminals at DFW...and can report that they are basically all consistently good and competent. The biggest detractor I can find is that there's no airport WiFi. At least, I haven't ever found one to sign into. I agree with a previous reviewer that a lot of the hateful reviews must come from passengers who are generally unaware of the requirements of modern air travel (which is okay; not everyone flies weekly like I do) but don't want to admit when they've made a mistake.

2017-11-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,Dallas Fort-Worth Airport customer review,False,"  Myself and my friends were flying through Dallas for a trip to Las Vegas, our flight was around 15 minutes late, but we still had time to get through and transfer onto our next flight, well thats what we thought. We arrived at the automated desks to put our esta details through and received a receipt, if you have an x on this there is additional security which is fair enough but when 5 out of 6 of the same party are put in that queue, bear in mind there was over 100 people in this queue and only 3 desks open out of a possible 20 desks that isnt good enough. I asked a member of staff as to why there are no staff on to deal with the amount of people in the queue I got a shrug of the shoulders and told to move, they were not interested in the fact we were going to miss our connection because of this and we were not the only ones this happened to. Once through, which had taken well over an hour to get through, we had missed our connection. Went to the American Airlines desk as we had missed our connection to be told there are no more flights tonight and would have to fly at 07.04am the next day, I told the lady that we would require a hotel for the night for the 6 of us, was told as we flew in on a BA flight we would have to see them in regards to that. I kindly told the lady that American Airlines is part of the same alliance as British Airways and would she call them to do so, eventually we were given a hotel and were told to go upstairs to the BA desk where they were waiting for us. Surprise they knew nothing about it, so took our passports went into an office and we waited over 20 minutes for them to give us voucher for this. I will unless necessary for the customer avoid going through Dallas again.",-1,DFW

",True," Appallingly organized airport. An hour waiting in line for the so-called 'automatic passport system', which then did not work, so a further 40 minutes for a human being to rescue the system. Very bad-tempered staff who were surly and rude. The Customs and Passport officers themselves were great. No complaints there.

As a frequent flyer I can attest that the negative reviews come from nervous, irritated or clueless travelers that can’t follow basic instructions. No you can’t bring the water, yes you must remove your shoes, no a knife is a knife no matter what size it is, priority means priority not general boarding, etc. I have to say I haven’t really been to too many airports where the fault is with the airport it is always the rude travelers. Why everyone flying feels like the only reason they are there is because their private jet is being worked on is beyond me. Travelers, just smile, relax ask the TSA agent how his day has been going and you will get through security quickly and stress free.

For an airport of this scale, you’d think they knew how to organize things better but they don’t. Lines are beyond ridiculously long, and security check personnel (those who look at your passport and ask about your bags and those who inspect your bag after the X-ray) are completely hateful and treat you like they are above you and you are just cattle.

FInally many of us were sent to the wrong line, the green line, for those who do not have checked baggage,.

My experience with DFW was by far the worst airport experience of my life. The TSA personnel at the security check in treated us no less than like basic trainees first entering the armed forces! We were constantly yelled and treated like kindergarteners. At one point an officer told the woman in from of me in a very rude tone to remove her jacket and put it on the conveyor. When I followed suit and removed mine, he yelled at me telling me that he didn't tell me to remove my jacket. Do as you are told, he yelled. Very, very rude people and a very disturbing experience. I've only touched the surface of all that happened during the check in. The rudeness was so widespread among the staff that I feel that it is definitely a reflection of a serious leadership problem with the TSA at the airport, or at least that portion of the terminal.",-1,DFW

We sat on the ground for 30 minutes waiting on a gate and almost missed our connection. We came in on B and had a departing flight on C concourse. We followed the signs and found some C gates but only 1 through 5 or something. Reached a dead-end. We had to backtrack 15 or 20 gates and go up one level to the people mover to get to the balance of the C gates.,-1,DFW

For years now, I have tried to avoid parking here at all costs. Shuttle bus service is erratic, and drivers routinely ignore passengers waiting. Lot attendants are typically rude and standoffish. Unfortunately on my last trip, there was no Uber available at 4am, and I had to drive and park at DFW. When I returned to DFW a week later, the Remote South bus pulled up near the stop, the driver looked at me as I waved, and just continued on. This has happened to me multiple times over the past two years, either in the lot or at the terminal pickup stop. Drivers stare at you, ignore, and roll on by. This time I had to wait another 15 minutes in 100 degree heat with my wife and two young children. DFW may be well run in some areas, but their parking/transportation departments are dreadful. No sense of customer service whatsoever.",1,DFW

A regular entry point from Sydney. Usual arrival is mid afternoon and it is a breeze to get through immigration control, pick up bags and recheck for the onward. Qantas arrive at Terminal D and usually out of Terminal A to pick up an American Airlines flight. Quick trip on the light rail and you are there. On the last trip it was in reverse. Arrive at Terminal A, out of D. There was 90 minutes between flights but enough time to get to the Admirals Lounge at TD, quick freshen up and out. Although the Qantas flight left at 10 pm, it was very quiet in Terminal D and many of the shops were winding down for the night but still found a couple of places to pick up some snacks. When a review only complains about how quiet it is and not much happened then that's a pretty good review.",1,DFW
2017-05-22,0.4,Couple Leisure,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,the employees are not friendly,False,"  What a ridiculous experience. Generally, DFW is ok as far as airports go. The construction can make things difficult, but I appreciate their attempts to stay up to date. It's sheer size can make navigating difficult, but it's one of the largest airports in the US, so that is to be expected. Here's my biggest consistent problem with DFW: the employees are not friendly. Many of them are downright rude. Sure, there are a few random friendly faces, but vast majority of people you interact with act like you're stupid and like they have about 50 other things they could be doing instead of helping you. This is such a huge disappointment to me as a Texan because we are known for our friendly, welcoming demeanor. I hate to think that those mannerless jerks are the first impression people traveling in from other states or countries experience. I have never been spoken to by a stranger they way those people speak to you, it's disgraceful. Every single one of them ought to be ashamed of themselves and ought to have their hides tanned by their parents, since that clearly wasn't done enough in their childhood. Manners matter people! Today, however, was a nightmare. We flew back to DFW after a vacation in Mexico. We were told our baggage would come out at carousel 5. We waited for nearly 45 minutes before a fellow passenger - not employee - noticed bags coming out 3 terminals away. No announcement was made over the loudspeakers that are everywhere, no information was shown on the screens in the baggage claim area, they just let us sit there and watch an empty carousel. There were also 2 other flights that came in behind us and got their luggage first. That was the first thing that frustrated me to death. Then, just before a handful more flights got in, they decided to close half of the immigration stands. It took us an hour and a half to get our bags and get through immigration. We are American citizens traveling back to our home country, there is no reason it should have taken that long. Shame on you, DFW. You have disappointed me too many times for me to finally not say something for others to see.",-1,DFW

2017-04-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,experience absolutely terrible,False," My daughter and I traveled from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth for a connecting flight to Phoenix Sky Harbor. The experience at this airport was absolutely terrible. Our flight from London to start arrived 26 min late. We were informed by the crew that passengers with connecting flights leaving within 2 hours to grab a ""orange tag"" upon leaving plane so that we could be expedited through customs and baggage recheck. Also we were told to quickly get to customs since another large flight was landing as well. There were no orange tags for us to grab. When we arrived to customs section, it was complete chaos. I asked 2 employees where we were to go and that we were supposed to be supplied these orange tags to expedite us to our connecting flight which was leaving in less than an hour and 15 min. We had to wait in a long and spiraling line. In the middle of this, a border control agent announces that we could get through customs if we signed in through our mobile phones. By the time my daughter got to the ""questions"" portion, we were already at automated customs check. Then we had to wait at baggage carousel for a lengthy amount of time. Once retrieved, we had to go into another extremely long and spiraling line for connecting flights and bag recheck. Again I told an employee that our flight was leaving in less than an hour and about the ""orange expedite tag."" And again told to wait in long line. When we got further in, I spoke to another employee, told her ""our story"" again, she immediately sent us to another line which, I believe Global Entry. She specifically sent us to the shorter of these 2 lines. Once up to that desk, the person proceeded to argue with us that we should have been in the other line next to it. We told him we were sent to it by the other employee. He was so rude, nasty, and did not listen to anything that we said. And on top of that, he marked our tickets with an A, for agriculture. We didn't have any kind of food in our luggage and told him that, so because of that ""mark"" we had to go to another line to get our luggage scanned. By the time we got through that line, with again telling employees ""our story"" and that our tickets shouldn't have been marked for agriculture since we had no food, we had less than 20 min to make our flight and our luggage was still not collected. After finally dropping our luggage off , we had to take a skyline to the other end of the airport. We finally made it to our gate at exactly our departure time, in which the employee told us that we had just made it and to hurry onto flight. We will never choose to fly into this airport again. Obviously a lot more employees and well-trained at that, are needed at each of the sections and a better system needs to be in place.",-1,DFW

Will avoid DFW at all costs for future travel. This was a shocking experience for transit between international and domestic AA flights. With 1.5hrs between arrival and departure, we arrived on time and felt comfortable. We'd been informed new immigration procedures were in place but the on board arrivals video was not that clear and it only got worse on disembarking. Eventually we figured we could go through the automated passport channel which required us to scan our passport and green card and then collect print out. I was referred for 2nd inspection which didn't take much time although on entering the baggage claim area, it was sheer chaos. After collecting our bags the queue to get through a 2nd immigration channel snaked through the whole of half of the baggage reclaim area, moving at snails pace, causing many travellers, including ourselves much stress, and no options for fast track even with tight connection times. Lines were not clearly signed and caused uncertainty for travellers. Abrasive and officious CBP Officer did little for the ""welcome to the USA"" experience. Next challenge - rechecking bag for domestic leg. Bags everywhere, with 3 people trying their best to put bags on the conveyor. Pushed ours to the front in order to ensure they had some chance of making the now very tight connection. And then of course the next security check which again was plagued by queues and confusion over a new policy that means there are no bins to put things in to and no requirements to take out PC etc. and take off belt and shoes. This wasn't explained at the approach. A quick sprint for our family of 5 meant we made the gate with 5 mins to spare before doors closed. The DFW transit took a ridiculous and extremely stressful 1hr 15mins.",-1,DFW

As an American who has lived and worked abroad for the past 13 years and has traveled through major hubs all over the world, I had one of my worst experiences to date at DFW when flying from Puerto Vallarta to Charlotte, arriving January 11, 2017 around 5.00 pm. I was stuck along with thousands of other passengers in immigration and customs for 2 hours and would have missed my connecting flight had it not been delayed by 40 minutes. American Airlines claims their reservation system safely factors clearance times into their scheduling. This is not true as I and many others found out. There were many passengers around me who were told that they had already missed their connecting flights when they rechecked their bags following customs clearance. There were no airport employees visible in the baggage claim area to direct the multitudes and there were many immigration stations and TSA security lanes that were closed at what appears to have been the busiest period of the day. I ran into one AA flight attendant in the crowd who was just as bewildered as the wandering masses! The capacity is available, but employees need to be hired and scheduled for peak times. From my experience, management at DFW is doing a very poor job. I have already cancelled future flights I had booked through the international terminal at DFW.",-1,DFW

Shopping and dining opportunities abound, but travelers aren't typically there for the high-end options. Airports exist to connect travelers to their flights, with an offering of convenient quick-stop amenities for a bite to eat and a beverage of your choice. DTW appears to have been laid out with good intentions, with features like the quick elevated tram and plentiful people movers. Nonetheless, the airport lacks adequate quick-stop amenities that the hurried traveler depends upon. Furthermore, those amenities shut their doors/kiosks well before the final flights have delivered the last weary travelers, leaving them with no option for a snack or drink (other than vending machine). The hiring practices at the airport, particularly the TSA agents and ticket counter personnel, are also marginal. These folks seem to think that being surly is part of their job description. There are exceptions to this blanket statement, of course, and those gems are truly valued. Also, the curbside baggage handlers and Skycaps are typically quite friendly and courteous. (Of course, those gentlemen are often tipped for handling bags.) The security lines are often long, but the floors and facility itself are clean. It looks good. Once through security, it is easy to get to your terminal. Overall, a middling airport.",1,DTW

I was told to sit close to the check-in counter and they will come. I waited for half an hour and decided to slowly and with difficulty walk towards the wheelchair assistance counter. When I got there with my daughter, we saw several customers screaming at the lady at the counter. They have been waiting for so long and nobody came to push them. Many were frustrated. Some decided to limp the whole way to the gate as they did not want to miss their flights. When I got to the counter the lady at the counter had my name already and there were so many passengers ahead of me, all waiting in frustration and anxiety. My flight was 6.15 pm and by the time we got a person to push me through, it was 5.30 pm. I barely made it to the plane after the security check. With this delay, I did not have time to stop for restroom or buy some food before the flight. I would say collectively in 2 locations my wait time was 1 hour just for the wheelchair service. And it was 1 hour only because 3 passengers ahead of me decided to limp to their gates and remembering my trip to Texas in July it was the same problem. There was not enough wheelchair assistance to push people who have difficulty walking or unable to walk. Worried that I may miss my flight with my daughter who was flying with me to Texas in July, pushed me as we had our own wheelchair. But this trip, I am on my own and I am depended on assistance. Why is there an acute shortage of wheelchair assistants? Looks like it was not an issue yesterday only.

I knew going in that DTW would be even busier with it being Christmas. When I got inside, the check-in kiosk for Delta did not recognize any of my information. This occurred in Greenville when I flew to Detroit on 12/21/18. I stood in a very long line for 30 minutes before reaching the check-in agent. The check-in agent could not help me at all and said I needed to go stand in ""a special line."" So, I go and I stand in another line, this time for maybe 15 minutes. Remember, I have a toddler, a car seat, and a carry on bag I am trying to handle by myself. This special check-in employee was able to check me in. Apparently because I had a minor flying with me, that is why the kiosk would not allow me to check-in. Then I was told that while they could check the car seat for free under Delta policy, I would need to walk to the other side of the Delta check-in terminal and place it with the oversized luggage. Now I had to walk across the terminal to drop the car seat off and then walk all the way back to the other side I started at in order to go through security. Again, remember that I am one adult trying to manage a car seat, a toddler, and a carry-on bag. I finally get back to the other side of the check-in terminal and to domestic security check. Thankfully we were able to get through security rather quickly. Then you have one TSA agent who was literally having almost every bag in his line be checked. I had a back pack and a carry-on that needed to be checked, which means additional wait time because only one person was there going through items. I know TSA has to do their jobs, but this agent was flagging almost every bag going through (I watched him with the bags before and after ours). Yes, I had toys from Christmas morning we were trying to get home to SC. I have flown in and out of Detroit numerous times to visit my family in MI. I have never experienced such frustration and utter anger with Detroit as I did yesterday. Dtw is not made for parents who are flying solo with a child, plain and simple. There are no courtesy strollers or luggage carriers with a child seat attached. When I expressed my frustration to a Delta agent about being a solo parent trying to fly with a minor and being told to wait and then walk all over the airport, all I got was backlash about how everyone has to do it. It is not hard to be parent/child friendly.",-1,DTW

She mumbled something and I was next in line. So I asked if I should come to her. She rolled her eyes and repeated “next in line” with a sarcastic tone. Why so nasty? I did nothing offense. The next worker was another woman telling people to take shoes off and stay with your belongings until they go on the conveyor to be x-rayed. She apparently was tired of saying take your shoes off, so she mumbled (loud enough for everyone to hear) “I am apparently just talking to myself”. While these incidents may not seem like a big deal, they do reflect on the airport and set the tone for people’s trips. If you don’t like your job find another.",1,DTW

There is also free WiFi that works well.",1,DTW
2018-06-24,0.1,Business,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,overpriced shopping mall,False," Airport or overpriced shopping mall? I travel quite frequently for work and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) is one of the most ridiculous places I transit. This airport seems to consider itself some sort of luxury shopping experience instead of a place to board or change airplanes. Walking through the airport you will notice large selection of expensive name brand stores and high priced restaurants. You will also notice a sever lack of quick and useful concessions. I can't speak for all travelers, but I myself rarely have time during my 1 hour connection time to have a nice sit down dinner at PF Changs and then do some browsing at Swarovski Crystal. What I do have time for is to stop at a food concession that will have my order ready in a reasonable amount of time and maybe for a nice cup of coffee. Neither of these is a possibility at DTW. The severe lack of of basic food/beverage concessions is appalling. Any concession that would be considered ""quick"" is never quick in DTW. The biggest reason is because of the lack of options the lines at the ""quick"" places is often out the door and these places are generally understaffed. On example is the Starbucks located in the A terminal. There are 2 Starbucks for 76 gates, each staffed with 2 under motivated individuals. I have seen lines with over 20 people in them while not surprisingly the Hugo Boss store next door is completely empty. Detroit Airport needs to figure out its true purpose. The purpose of an airport is to provide paying passengers the opportunity to get a bite to eat and a coffee while attempting to make a connection that has most likely been reduced because of weather or some other reason. It is not to sell MAC cosmetics and running gear.",-1,DTW
2018-05-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,No help for the handicapped,False,"  No help for the handicapped at this airport. The disaster started with a 40 minute wait for my arriving plane to get a gate for us to debark. In 60 years of flying, in airports all over the country, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my plane to get a gate. Then finding that my connecting flight was in another building and I would ""just have to go downstairs, through the tunnel and upstairs to the other gates,"" the gate clerk scoffed at me when I said that would take 40 minutes with my arthritic knees. He didn't offer transportation, I had to ask for it. Apparently there are no golf carts or trolleys for the mobility disabled at the airport, as there are in every other airport I've visited. He ordered a wheelchair, which took 20 minutes to arrive. In spite of everyone's assurances that I would make it, the plane left without me when I was only a gate and a half away. No one ever attempted to contact the departing gate to let them know that a crippled passenger was trying desperately to get there on time. Other than the wheelchairs, which are slow and take an inexcusable amount of time to arrive, this airport makes no attempt to accommodate mobility handicapped persons. There were no electric carts traveling the length of the interminably long tunnel between C and A terminals, and none that I could see at gate level either. Again, something I've seen in all but the smallest airports. This is not a place a mobility disabled person would want to travel through.",-1,DTW
2018-04-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,most dysfunctional airport,True,"  This is the most dysfunctional airport I have ever seen. I was just there to change planes. It is extremely time-consuming and difficult to navigate the 3 huge far-flung terminals with poor signage and no explanation of how to get from one to the other. I had to ask staff along the way or I would have wandered endlessly. I actually had to go through security a 2nd time that was located *inside a hotel* at the airport because the regular security was not operating. They also seem to have a rule against scanning luggage. My suitcase was *lost for 5 days* with no record of it ever being scanned by either airline I flew, so I thought it was lost at the point of origin. It was finally located at the *wrong airline* in Detroit (why they sat on it for 5 days, I'll never understand). It took a dozen phone calls and literally hours on hold to get the bag located and sent to a 4th airport (because I was no longer in the city where it was supposed to go.) There was one helpful woman at Detroit who tried and did help me, finally. If it weren't for her my bag would still be a mystery. Delta denied all responsibility but was required to reimburse my out-of-pocket expenses (my daughters having to buy changes of clothing.)",-1,DTW

El Paso airport is the best airport to be stranded in! It has an easily-accessed smoking area in a lovely courtyard. It's small enough to get around quickly, but big enough to have decent food. My delays would have been much worse in a larger airport, but El Paso airport made my delays manageable. Staff were also great.

However the worst part is the staff: Rude! and unnecessarily so, immigration officers have a terrible attitude, I was treated like a liar. My identity had to be investigated beyond what is done at the passport control booth, and the way I was told to proceed was humiliating, everything was completed in less than two minutes and I was allowed to got home, the rudeness was a totally unnecessary extra that only eroded the expected professionalism of those officers.

Getting in or out of here is a challenge at every turn. I flew in and out of EWR recently and nothing went right. The AirTrain is dreadfully unreliable. On the way in it wasn’t working properly so I had to transfer trains and it took almost a half hour to get to the rail station. If the train into NYC hadn’t been delayed I would have missed it and had to wait even longer. On the way out the airtrain just stopped without explanation for 10-15 minutes leaving everyone trapped inside wondering how long we would be stuck. For $8 each way anyone would expect better for a train that only takes you 2-3 miles. The rest of the airport isn’t any better. On the way in baggage took 45 minutes and was delivered to 2 different carousels despite the boards saying it was only delivered to one. On the way out the security line was an hour. Pre check wasn’t an option, crazy in such a major airport. In short EWR is a model of inefficiency and a masterclass on how to antagonize customers at every turn.",-1,EWR

When I asked for a supervisor or airport police to attend, they ignored me again saying they didn’t think they would. Eventually they picked my shoes up from under the chair of the person who checks the monitor at the scan and placed them on the belt.

I've been to airports all over the US, Canada, and South-East Asia and I have never experienced customer service this poor. This is my first time passing through New Jersey and I was worried that this is just how people are in New Jersey. However, after reading some of these reviews and learning that this Newark airport ranks among the worst in the country, I look forward to meeting some real New Jersians. I first observed the staff being unneccesarily confrontational with a man who didn't check a large bag. They waited until he got all the way through the line in security before reprimanding him for not checking his bag as if this large, grown man was an unruly child. Then a security lady procceded to aggressively rush the next woman in line who was travelling with 3 small children. This exchange was unapathetic and useless considering they were already going as fast as any reasonable people would. Then I got to the bag scan security area where the woman gave vague instructions in a dry tone. After i loaded my bag, emptied my pockets, and put everything in the bin she allowed it to pass into the scanner before telling me I also need to take off my shoes. When I loaded these into the bin and put it on the turnstile she pushed it back at me and told me to take my stuff out and let the next passenger load their things, because I ""wasn't listening"". The multiple employees I've encountered in this airport seem to all be angry at something, and its unfortunate that they are taking this out on the customers.",-1,EWR

Border control was one of the worst experiences of my life! Only 4 desks open for a turnstile line of roughly 500 people for non USA citizens and 2 open for USA only queue of roughly 100! After queuing for 2 and half hours and very near boarding closure staff then proceeded to open the check-in point we were close to for the small USA only queue only! Answer when we tried to point out we were about to miss our flight was `see your travel rep on the other side.' Finally got through and duty free clear bag also containing my husbands personal belongings got pulled for checking behind 4 other trays, panic stricken I asked if there was anything staff could do for us as boarding closed in 3 minutes and got the response to get in line, staff then chatted away to each other giggling whilst nonchalantly re-checking the pulled trays!

There was a large line for TSA at Terminal B for the 40-47 gates. Coming down the escalator I could hear this loud yelling coming from downstairs. When I made it to the second level, an airport employee wearing a red shirt was nearly chasing people down and berating them for not keeping up with the line, the issue was, they were trying to but when they’d ask her for clarification she would get in their face and tell them to get to the back of the line if they couldn’t keep up. Then, she let 6 people cut in line in front of a patient gentleman and he asked her to please let him get back in his place and she came within inches of his face and began yelling at him saying “Do you want to do the job for me!? You wanna do the job!? Then stay in your place.” And he just simply gave up and sat down. Another employee in a blue shirt walked up to her and couldn’t even calm her down, couldn’t even get a word in. I approached and asked how to get to the TSA Pre Check line and she looked me in the eyes and laughed and then said demeaningly, “You go to the front.” I’ve never traveled through this terminal so I was confused and said “How do I get to the front?” She groaned VERY loudly and then yelled in my face “How do you think!? You walk?!” And continued to yell at me as I began walking and removing myself from the situation, I responded as I turned around already quite distanced from her but she was still yelling at me and said “Ma’am please I did nothing to you.” And she motioned to shoo me away. Multiple people were shaken up and asked if I was okay as well. It was disgusting treatment and behavior.

We landed in terminal A and they forced us to leave the airport and go through security again to get to terminal C for our connecting flight. I guess I'm just glad our layover wasn't too short because you need a couple of hours or you'll miss you'll flight. We couldn't get to much food and felt so rushed due to having to go through security again. It would have been better to spend an extra $500 per person to have a layover in another airport. Lesson learned, we won't ever fly through here again. Oh and the so-called kid play areas are dirty, sticky, with broken pieces making it dangerous and the staff do not care at all.

It is in the middle of a spaghetti of roads with appalling signage. We drove 25 miles to get across the road to the hotel and on return, much the same to get in to the hotel on the airport. The Marriot hotel signs come and go and are inconsistently located. It has a dinky monorail between the parts of the airport, but no signs that tell you which way the train is going. Check in fine. No clear signage to security. Security is a mess. No thought given to a flow of space to prepare for passing through, as in room to put the trays and remove clothes, signs say to take things out of bags, then staff say to leave them in, then take off shoes and walk on a cold floor. Then no space for the trays to come through and pick up your tray, then no space to take the tray to put your stuff back on. Even most provincial airports are better laid out. Then the most pathetic duty free shopping. I sincerely hope I never need to pass this airport again. I thought Gatwick was bad but this one is the worst.",-1,EWR
2023-05-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a terrible service all round,False,"  Newark has to be a contender for the worst airport in the world. We arrived at about 10 pm in the evening, planning to fly out to Belize the next day, and then returned three weeks later with an overnight stay in NYC and a flight home out of JFK. The arrival was a disaster. Customs and Immigration was overburdened with about four agents serving multiple flights. The queue lasted more than an hour and, when we finally got out, the SkyTrain service to other terminals had essentially closed down, running backwards and forwards from stops, with no apparent rhyme or rhythm. There were confused passengers everywhere and the staff on the ground could merely shrug and say this was par for the course. Efforts to get to the bus terminal to catch a coach to our hotel were also stymied by the fact that the SkyTrain was no longer going to that stop and nobody knew how to walk there. In the end, we hiked down a busy road, jumped over a concrete siding and jackrabbited through oncoming cars. Other people found a safer way, but that was purely fortuitous. Our departure to Belize the next day was no better. Horrible queues at check-in, a general lack of understanding and knowledge among ground staff and, when we finally made it to the terminal, nowhere to eat that accepted cash or cards. If you don't have a payment app on your phone, you are not getting fed in Newark. Just a terrible service all round.",-1,EWR
2023-05-08,0.6,Business,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,expect more flexibility and service,False," The airport itself is much improved. It's no longer an empty wasteland. The lines are better than they used to be. TSA is its own thing, so I won't hold that against the airport. That said, the prices at the various restaurants are out of this world. A glass of terrible Sauvignon Blanc is $20. Some bad pizza was another $22. Candidly, I felt mocked for having paid that much for what I got. Having to do everything via QR codes is also annoying. What happened to service? As it happens, the poor staff seemed run off their feet trying to fix people's payment problems. The nice Dutch family next to me had tons of cash - but, no, Newark doesn't take cash. I mean, it's an airport - you expect a little more flexibility and service.",-1,EWR

Had to go through customs after receiving our baggage, they check our baggage. Then gave our bags back again to give to United Airlines. Went through the airport security AGAIN! Walked through the airport only to find out we were outside the back end of the airport, had to wait for a shuttle bus to take us to United Airlines departure area. Once we arrived, we had to go through security again, only to miss our flight by 6 minutes! They need to post times on how long it takes getting from one location of the airport to the other area!

Forced to check a bag all the way to baggage claim at final destination instead of checking to pick up at arrival gate. When flyers have chosen to just fly with a carry-on, they need to get in and out of an airport fast. Not only that but finding the rental car area is very confusing and while headed there, we received conflicting directions from airport staff. Will avoid Newark from here on out and will tell everyone I can about how messed up their checking bags at the gate is. Horrible!",-1,EWR

Transportation from one terminal to the next is easy to follow. There are plenty of places to sit down and have something to eat or drink. Yes, it is expensive but so are other airports. Yes, they use the iPads, which I think it awesome as it is so easy to order your food/drinks. Restrooms are clean and there are plenty of them. I found the staff to be very helpful and courteous. The new terminal A is beautiful with lots of natural light and great rest areas to hang out between flights. I have no complaints and have used Newark and United connecting to and from Amsterdam a few times now and will continue to do so without a problem.",1,EWR

2023-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,will never fly through Newark again,True," We flew into Newark airport as a layover from LAX to Paris. Originally we had a 3 hour layover. The plane was 3 hours late. We had to run through Newark airport from one gate to another in the same terminal. However, when we got to the next set of gates, there was another security checkpoint with a huge line. We have never had to go through security again when switching from one flight to another in the same airport and we have traveled all over the world. There were hundreds of people in line and they were already boarding our flight. Our daughter had flown in from another airport earlier and was on the other side texting us. I asked the airport staff member near me about the line and told her that my plane was boarding. She said all of these people's planes are boarding. The airline would come get me. (Really? When do airlines come get someone out of a security line?) She said I could ask the people in line to go ahead of them. There were hundreds. We went further down in line asking everyone if we could please go ahead. At one point we followed a desperate French girl who was begging her way through. We finally got through and they held our luggage. They ran my husband's carry-on back through the machine. My carry-on just sat there on a table. I asked the staff behind the glass to please help me. Could they please check my bag because my plane was boarding. They ignored me. They ignored my husband. Complete, absolute deafness. We were not being rude. I was really begging in desperation at this point - almost in tears at the stress and frustration of the situation. Nothing. My husband got angry when another staff member came through and the girls hugged and laughed and chatted as they continued to ignore us and our luggage! He yelled saying, ""I know you can hear me! You need to check the luggage and give it to us!"" My husband has traveled all over the world in all sorts of conditions his entire life. He has never gotten like this in an airport, no matter how frustrating things can be. I told him to go on to the gate. One of the staff members finally grabbed my bag and would not speak to me or have eye contact. She was muttering about rude people telling her how to do her job. She swabbed the hand warmers that I had that were still in the original packaging and wanted to know why I had them. ""To keep my hands warm in Europe."" These went through LAX, Paris, Barcelona, Mallorca, and Venice on this trip without one person questioning them! My luggage was never stopped anywhere else. Every person at this airport was rude. I am not exaggerating. We flew back in from Paris 2 weeks later and the signage is not very good. We couldn't tell where to go for ground transportation - hotel shuttles. My husband stopped to ask someone and the staff member just kept yelling at everyone ""Just go through the doors!"" He was very rude to everyone. Once we went through the unlabled doors, there was signage. It would have been helpful before! When we got to the transport trains to go to another terminal to catch the shuttle, the female staff member was yelling at everyone about train directions. This was not just projecting her voice to be heard. She was rude and sarcastic and yelling. The instructions were so complicated and she was so rude that we just left the train area and went to get a taxi. It was worth the money to get out of that airport! We will never fly through Newark again.",-1,EWR

Who design or is in charge of the shuttles systems (to Terminals A and B)? A disastrous way to move people to one place to another. No organization, no help, a rudiments system with employees screaming to people…you name it. Where is the government accountability?  Worst of all: if you tried to submit a complaint it fails.

I always go to gate I fly out of to eat because it’s closer. C had lots of options to eat and restaurants. We come to A via the map to see what was there and we had to wait in security all over in a long line! Ridiculous. I have 2 children. I’ve been to a tons of airports this is insane.

All I will say is even with the renovations they never fixed the staff problem. Nobody seems to value their job or have a clue what customer service is. I usually don't review but this is more of a warning than complaint. Every-time I am in terminal C and try to use the food court to order something I almost never get my food because it took too long, they forgot, can't even find anyone to ask, or this time completely ignored. I stood there for 30 min when I got a text that my meal was ready and no one even acknowledged me. I finally just gave up and boarded my flight.",-1,EWR

2022-09-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,Do better Newark,False,"  I will avoid having to do anything through Newark Intl in future. I live in Brooklyn, but rented a car for travel in New Jersey, picking up from Newark International airport (EWR). It is already a painful experience to get to EWR on public transport where there is only one train an hour from Penn Station in Manhattan on Sundays. The last leg to the rental place is the Air Train which literally takes almost 30 minutes to go from one end of the airport to the other and stops for 5 minutes at each terminal and makes multiple delay stops on the tracks. Why? I missed my return train to NYC as a consequence. I saw many other frustrated travelers as well. When raising this with the customer service attendant at the station she basically smirked at me and told me to leave a review on Google. Her complete indifference was infuriating and amplified a general attitude of complacency which makes having anything to do with this airport undesirable. Do better Newark.",-1,EWR

I'm guessing she treats many people this way but nobody confronts her because they just want to get going. I would probably do the same thing but she and two male employees had just finished boarding a flight to Toronto so when I asked her a question about my gate # she totally snapped at me and I told her ""don't speak to me like that"", she became even ruder and when I asked to speak to a manager nobody would do anything, the two men stood there while she told them not to help me and I asked them are you seriously going to do nothing? They looked at me and I told them how shameful they were. I'm so disgusted by how I was treated. I took her picture, it was gate B-52. Newark airport should be embarrassed and mortified by some of the reviews I'm now reading.",-1,EWR

Yes having to click on a qr code for a menu has become pretty mainstream during the covid years. However the system is unable to read a credit card. So patrons have to enter their name on the card, the card number, expiration and security code each and every time the patron wishes to order an additional item. Really? the system can not read a credit card, venmo or other? Time to look to replace the system as soon as possible, this is costing you sales as people are walking away.",1,EWR

After nearly an hour of waiting (and nearly missing my plane), and repeated requests, and several people now waiting for chairs, two women appear on the horizon pushing empty wheelchairs and walking so slowly they might have been standing still. Finally she pushes me towards the screening area where there are three lines of people waiting to go through. One line has only one person waiting for the agent to approve their ticket/ID to go through screening. She gets on that line but just as the person in front of us goes through (we would be next), she switches lines that has more people in front of us. As that line goes down and we're about to go through, she switches again to a longer line. And now my boarding time is only a few minutes away. I turn to her and ask why are we switching lines? ""Stop yelling at me,"" is her reply (and no, I wasn't yelling). Clearly this woman's goal is to do as little work as possible. Pretty sure that's the goal at Newark Airport as a whole.",-1,EWR

The system is an abomination and unjust both to workers and customers. I will not be flying through Newark as long as this atrocity persists. You have $600 ipads placed everywhere which only give a QR code. It is the only way to way to order food and drinks, but internet cannot keep up with the demand. The internet is spotty at best requiring a crazy amount of time to just place an order. And for those customers who can use it, the system lures them into a false sense of security that their food and drink will be delivered in normal fashion. Yet, I witnessed numerous customers wait more than 30 minutes for drinks, more than 45 minutes for food, and then, without orders ever being delivered, have to fight for reimbursement or lose money due to their flight schedule. We cannot tip for good service and in general customers receive lousy service because workers are forced to contend with a system that fosters anger with both customers and workers. Don't even get me started with plastic being used everywhere, creating more harm for the environment. All of this is a cost-cutting measure to serve the wealthy elite who care nothing local workers. I am appalled at such an horrific system that removes convenience, friendliness and expedience. Those at the top approving this should be fired.",-1,EWR

My husband and I had a beer each at one of only two palaces to sit and eat available and it cost us $26? This is an extortionate amount to pay for a beer in a plastic glass.  Shocking to think that an international airport has nothing to buy apart from souvenirs. You can’t even try the perfumes on as there are no testers available.

Then at bag drop off, the staff were as unfriendly as rude, very disappointed, at security the staff just dont know how to control the influx of passengers, directed from one place to another, everything taken out of bag and put into the boxes, when you ask about passport and docs, get told that you keep them with you only until you have to pass through the scanner then you get told go and put it back in a box.

We were all treated so badly. I have travelled the world, and I honestly don’t remember this type of treatment anywhere else. In addition, my husband and I were unable to access to the lounge (despite having a priority pass membership), as we were told that this was only allowed in Terminal B (we were in Terminal C).

I was flying out for vacation with my family. I arrived at the airport before 5:00am for an 8am flight with united airlines. Due to a lack of staff because of Covid, they took over 1hr to check us in because of a system issue. I had to wait in a long line at customs and when I got to my gate, the gate was closed! They told me that there was a 10am flight that I could possibly get to if I would go to customer service. When I got to customer service, they gave me standby tickets and told me the flight would be delayed until 2pm. I waited all day for them to tell me that the flight was full! I am highly upset, I did not even go on my vacation. They told me to try for another flight for the next day which would be a red eye, but that was completely pointless since my vacation was only 5 days long.",-1,EWR

Security was chaotic, understaffed & judging by the equipment, lacked investment. The departure lounge has insufficient seating, no defined queuing areas, is massively overcrowded, has no facilities, is far too hot, & the PA system can't be heard over the noise. In short it is a complete shambles. New York/New Jersey authorities should be utterly ashamed & embarrassed by such a poor, dysfunctional airport.

2022-02-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,Avoid this place,True,"  Avoid this place. We had a reasonable 38 minute layover at Terminal 3, with both flights on the same big airline. Newark Facilities couldn't figure out how to connect the terminal ramp to the normal plane, so our deplaning was delayed about 10 minutes. We hustled to the gate of our connecting flight and arrived 8 minutes early. Only to find no one there and the plane gone, while the sign said ""Now Boarding Zone 3"". No announcements about boarding were heard on the fast trot there. Customer Service tells us Newark Facilities (the same clowns that delayed our deplaning) ordered our connecting flight to leave early. Thus between 4.30 to 9.20pm, we were stuck at this place. Good size terminal with many shops, but nowhere to sit down and order a nice dinner from a human and relax. The few shops that sold food, sold the same 12 items or so, at every place. Nothing healthy and nothing gluten free, which we need, just the exact 12 things everywhere. If we wanted to buy chips (potato, Fretos, Doritos, etc.), they had 1000's of options to choose from, but the opposite for every other type of food - it was ridiculous. As a captive market we expect to be gouged at an airport, but this place was by far and away the biggest gouger - triple most airports. $24 for a simple mixed drink, $17 for a small re-made salad or sandwich. No humans to order from, just the same kiosks everywhere, half of which didn't work.",-1,EWR
2022-02-02,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,a nice airport with lots of amenities,False,"  Newark Airport is underrated - if you know what you're doing. To most travelers, EWR is a very confusing airport with lots of (not so great connections) around the airport. However, once you get the hang of things, EWR is a nice airport with lots of amenities. Getting there, parking is very open most of the time, and most of the time you have to either book 24hrs in advance or go to Short Term parking. They accept multiple forms of payment such as EZ-Pass and credit cards (Terminal C accepts Cash). Getting there on train is also convenient from the city as NJTransit operates to Newark every 15-30 minutes from NY Penn Station. The AirTrain could be down occasionally, so make sure you have time to get to the terminal before your flight. About terminals, Terminal C and B have adequate facilities and places to shop. Terminal A however, is being torn down to make way for Terminal 1 in the future. Terminal A is one of the most dated terminals there is, and I would only recommend flying out of it unless you HAVE to (i.e JetBlue, United Express, Air Canada etc.). Security can be very slow at times at Terminal A (especially during busy hours). Terminal B is the international terminal. This terminal is somewhat dated, however, is way better than Terminal A. Customs are relatively quick here, never had an issue getting through. The last terminal (and where most of EWR's travelers go through) is Terminal C. Terminal C is the best terminal at current hands down. United has modernized this terminal to fit the needs of the modern traveler. The TSA process can be from what I experienced to be anywhere from 5-20 minutes, which isn't that bad. Be warned though, prices do get steep here in terms of retail options and dining options. There is very little cheap food options (besides the Wendy's and Dunkin Donuts, or the Starbucks pre-security), so if you want a good meal, be prepared to shell out some extra cash. Getting to any gate at Terminal C is relatively easy, as if you don't need to walk, there's buggies driving around taxing people through crowds to get to gates. (don't forget to tip them!). So in short from this review, if you're going in Newark, if the trip is a couple bucks extra going out of Newark on United in Terminal C, do it. Terminal C will be your greatest for connections, as well as overall amenities.",1,EWR
2022-01-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,set up to horribly disappoint,True," It appears that Newark Airport vendors are set up to horribly disappoint, if not anger, all travelers with reasonable expectations surrounding price, customer service, transparency, consistency and quality. Let's start with prices. One expects prices to be higher than normal in an airport but Newark has determined to outdo all other airports and even NFL stadiums in this category. $25 for a gin and tonic, $15 for a breakfast burrito (a marginal one at that) are examples of prices experienced. Convenience store items like snacks are priced similarly, knowing that no one would purchase if the price was visible, you never know the price until you check out. I had the pleasure of ordering breakfast at the Grand Bazaar (fancy name for food court). Order food on the tablet, then you are told to go pay elsewhere. Go to another tablet in a different area and pay (with a horribly convoluted process if you are given food vouchers which obviously won't cover the full price of your meal). You are given the option of ""no receipt"" which most opt for (luckily not I) as when you return to where you ordered your food you are required to present proof of payment. I saw that happen a half dozen times in less than 15 minutes. After waiting a very long time, I asked about my order (having already provided proof of payment when called earlier) and was told she could see my order. Interestingly, a container with my order number was sitting right next to her which I pointed out and they then assembled my order. I have to say, McDonalds breakfast burritos are far superior in taste to the one I got. For starters, it mainly consisted of about 6 eggs worth of unseasoned scrambled eggs with part of a sausage link cut up with a couple of small pieces of bell pepper and onion. It came with a side of cut up potatoes with no options for condiments to add flavor. With a career in retail, I've never seen a misalignment of personnel, product and process as bad as this.",-1,EWR

Unhelpful staff watched idly by as myself and other travelers struggled to figure out directions, signage, procedures and hours on our own. Extremely poor seating, especially pre-check in. Not disability or elderly friendly. TSA entrance was not properly labeled and I waited for 3 hours sitting on the floor in the wrong area, along with 5 other travelers before anyone told us TSA was open in another area. Disabled people, the elderly and families with children were treated terribly and not given proper attention or treatment. There is a horrible disconnect between all airport staff and no one knows anything or are withholding info and making fun of travelers. Bathrooms were not maintained with broken doors and bodily fluids everywhere. No proper security or safety measures. No enforcement of Covid-19 protocols with many, many travelers not wearing masks.

TSA staff in the passport check room were absolutely vile, not to me personally but I had to see how denigrating they were to other passengers, screaming at them, making fun of them to their faces, laughing out loud every time they would deny someone entry to the US as if they got a thrill from it. Never in my life had I experienced such vile behavior, the abuse of power is very clear.

What is in the water there? Dirty, escalators out of service, rude employees, crowded and the ""restaurant"" prices are outrageous. I have seen 3rd world airports where I have been better treated and surrounded by a better atmosphere. What a way to be greeted in the NY area. Someone needs to teach their employees manners and a way to interact with the world that isn't so abrasive and ""I don't care attitude. I was totally disgusted with this experience and will try my hardest to avoid this airport at all costs in the future. Now to be fair, the airline staff do not fall into this category but the local folks that have contact with the public need some real work.

The drive in was bad, the TSA employees are rude, and the Security lines are disorganized. Never mind about being TSA approved, it means nothing in this airport. Then there is the walk into the terminal. Federal mandate says you have to wear a mask. They should take a look at the condition of the Filthy common areas. The floors are disgusting, the bathrooms are makeshift bathrooms you would see for the homeless. Nothing is open no lounge no bars.

The terminal has a large number of food offerings and was very clean. After I dined, however, I began having issues. My next flight was out of terminal B, which meant I had to use the AirTrain. Unbeknownst to me, I had to clear security again, which had me rushing to my gate. I later found out that I could have taken the shuttle, however, the employees at terminal C never mentioned it. After making my way into terminal B, I had to walk around security multiple times, as it looked as if the checkpoint was closed, even though it was opened. I had just managed to make my flight on time, even after the gate agent told me that I needed to buy a KN95 mask, which Newark sells for 20 dollars. Beware of the mask policies - US airlines allow any cloth mask, but EU airlines demand a medical one. EWR is a great airport for a long connection, especially terminal C.

People are crammed into this place like an ant hill everywhere. Checkin lines are out if control. It took us 10 minutes fighting through crowds to get upstairs to the business check-in. Security lines especially after you retrieve your carry on bags from the belt are just plain in your face unsafe. Again, anthill.

I tried to talk to her that I would miss my flight if I had to wait for all those bags. Her answer I will get to it when I get to it. So after waiting impatiently she finally gets to my bag to only grab my thin tube of lysol wipes and wipe it with something and give me my bag. I had to sprint run to my gate. I mean where do you guys hire such insensitive people? Why do other businesses care about customer service and you don't? Do you offer any training to your employees or do you just take them off the street and put them to work? If you want to be checking bags for unreasonable reason then hire more people and educate them.",-1,EWR

We arrived around noon for a 3:00 pm flight on United Airlines. The disorganization and chaos was something out of a movie. Nobody at United knew where to go, the lines were out the door, and the employees seemed lost. Nobody was able to answer questions. One guy (not with us) was yelling out loud for someone from United Airlines to please assist with the chaos. We had my grandsons who are 7 and 5 years old. Thank goodness they were patient because it took us over 100 minutes to check in and check our bags. I have never in all my years experienced anything like it. I had TSA recheck on my boarding pass and the lady acted like she didn’t know where it was. I went through the regular line to avoid more problems. (on another note, I flew home on October 12 from here and the TSA precheck was CLOSED. People were livid! Why do we close that on a busy Sunday?) United Airlines should take most of the blame for this but Newark gets a little also. It was awful! We grabbed a quick bite before the flight and paid $36 for a salad and a small soda.

I had to walk beside the barking dog and was asked to come back to the starting place to walk again with the dog. My son was taken by a cop to another scanning area when we the three of the family were standing in another area for checking. Why couldn't they take all of us together when we were travelling together. He was terrified so were the rest of the family. We couldn't see him. After we were checked in the cop brought him to us.

Most of the staff were absolutely awful. This was only my second time flying and my mother’s first. Staff did not acknowledge us or attempt to help us, when we asked they acted like we were a bother to them. The customs person checking passports and boarding passes snatched my phone from me to scan my boarding pass. The woman in TSA had a major attitude and got mad when we told her that the bins under the table that she said were empty actually had stuff in them. I was in a great mood after my vacation but the staff at this airport ruined it completely. The staff at London Heathrow, Richmond International, Dulles, and Dubai International airports were never rude and disrespectful like this.

2020-02-17,0.7,Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,I'd still rather fly here than to LaGuardia,True,"  I flew into Terminal A and out of Terminal C the next day, both on United Express. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to leave the airport on public transit on the weekend because NJ Transit schedules 3 trains within 15 minutes of each other, then makes you wait 45 minutes for the next one. For that reason, I reluctantly shelled out for a Lyft into New York. I really appreciated that Newark lets you get into Lyft vehicles directly at the curbside - too many airports these days make you walk long distances to a distant parking garage to get your ride, but Newark's customer-friendly decision to let me get picked up at the curb meant that I could be on my way within 10 minutes of arriving, for which I give them high marks. Departing out of Terminal C was a little more hectic, the signage for how to get to security from the check-in desks was inadequate, and the employees who were supposed to be directing traffic were rude when asked for assistance. The food in Terminal C was overpriced, but I thought the quality was actually decent, and I liked the ability to order food on a tablet at the gate and get it delivered. Newark isn't great, and I wish the public transit powers that be would spread the trains out a little more so that there aren't 45 minutes wait for trains. But I'd still rather fly here than to LaGuardia.",1,EWR

Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6am, so we arrived a little after 4am. We breezed through check-in at the Delta counter with zero issues. Everyone was kind, professional, working efficiently, and quickly checked our bags in, printed our boarding passes, and directed us to security. A quick trip up the escalator and we were “greeted” with an enormously, annoyingly excessive long security line. Though the electronic signboard stated the minute-long wait for TSA pre-check, priority boarding, and regular, they informed us all lanes were closed but “regular.” This was was the first major slow down. Next, there was a large number of TSA agents per customers, the majority were dry, cold, and lacked professional courtesy/basic customer service (and some were just straight up rude) as they pushed people through this single lane and barked repetitive reminders about the speed in which to walk past the dog, etc. We are frequent flyers and have seen many other airports use the police dogs much more effectively than Newark. Why can’t they take a page out of JFK’s or DCA’s policy and just keep the line moving at a normal pace and have a lane for the dog to pass everyone? This was the second major slow down. We finally get to our security scan belt around 535am, knowing our flight is already boarding. They switch out TSA people to watch the screen, which stops our line. They yell over and over that nothing may be in a bin except large electronics and edibles. Again, the cold, curt way in which we were spoken to was unacceptable. We finally make it to the scanner and I’m randomly selected for additional screening. That didn’t take as long as I thought it might, but again, I’m now fearful I’m going to miss my flight that takes off in 15 min. No one cares. That was the third slowdown. We get through security to then be yelled at to take our shoes to a bench to put them back on... why can’t anyone show a bit of kindness???? Meanwhile, nearly everyone was passing, in front of or behind, us complaining about how horrible security was today. Why would they not open until 430am knowing people are scheduled to board 6am departing flights at 530? We made our flight but did get to the gate after boarding had already begun. I will be doing everything in my power to avoid the Newark airport for future travel and will tell my friends and family to do the same.",-1,EWR

Services such as restaurants while waiting are extremely limited. But the worst part was upon return getting through border control and customs. Landed early after a 10-hour flight and got in the line for US citizens. There were only 2 agents working. This for a place where planes carrying hundreds of passengers land. After nearly an hour we went past the agents to the machines to scan our passports and answer customs questions, when we had already filled out a form on the plane. We then had to get in another line to see another officer and this line also only had 2 officers working. We were part of a group trip and noticed nobody that had been in line ahead of us or behind us was in this new line. We noticed that no one else in the new line we were in held US Passports. We asked if we were in the right place and were told to stay in line with no explanation as to why. When we finally got to the officer he told us it was bad luck and scanned our passports. Nobody actually ever looked at the customs form. It took us two hours to get through customs and to our baggage. Terrible service. Will never fly through Newark again.",-1,EWR

Having travelled into JFK many times before I was comparing my experience in Newark to JFK. On arrival signage was clear and there were no queues for immigration. Only the queue that formed from our plane. Staff were pleasant and helpful in contrast to the rude staff at JFK. Baggage collection was fine and we were out of the airport within 40 minutes from arrival. This was at 12.00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Returning we found the check in quite confusing but we had plenty of help. There was a reasonably long but fast moving security queue and staff were serious but polite. Really liked the food ordering iPads and the free use of iPads in the departure lounge. Really nice feature. The food and drink outlets were very expensive. All in all a good experience and much better than JFK and I’d use United again next time I go back to New York.,1,EWR

Will need to be modernized in the near future. But overall, the biggest problem with this airport (and other in USA) is the people who work there. Many give more attention to consulting their phone during work time rather than offering a quality service to the passengers!

TSA lines are ridiculous, and attitude of TSA staff is horrible. TSA exit provides for only three seats to allow travlers space to re-pack and put on shoes. There is plenty of room for additional seating, just none provided. Restrooms - thought I was in a third world country. Semi permanent outhouse? Complete with queue like TSA? Totally ridiculous. If/when you actually get into one, it is filthy. Terminal - gate area, wide open, good seating, but not one flight monitor. I'm sorry, but if the e-ticket does not provide gate number, and the gate area provides no monitors, you are forced to stand in line to ask at a random gate station about other gate info. Once again - large amount of attitude.",-1,EWR

At least it is generally clean. I arrived from an international destination a few years back and never again. Try finding a Lufthansa code share and connect in Frankfurt or Munich instead. This is a United hub so I connect here occasionally but try to avoid it. Overcrowded and tired United Clubs. I think I will start using LaGuardia once the construction there is complete.

It took me two hours to clear immigration, had a departing flight with United from terminal C so planned to use United shuttle bus at gate 67 which means you don't have to go through security. When i went to recheck my bag in the belt had broken so they were using buses to terminals where you had to carry your baggage onto and as i was now out of the terminal had to clear security again at terminal C causing further delay, i ran to the gate and my flight was just boarding. Staff here are rude and don't answer any questions, signage is very poor and on returning gate signage was wrong sending me the wrong direction for my flight, will avoid this airport again.",-1,EWR

It wasn't too crowded for a Saturday afternoon, and the lines were alright as well",1,EWR
2019-10-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,asked multiple employees to help and nobody did,True," I had a flight today from Newark Airport into Detroit. I got to the airport at 8.45 for a flight that was scheduled to depart at 10.05. I had 3 bags, so I knew I needed to check one of the bags. Most airports let me check a bag at the gate. I have done so at Newark before. The TSA Worker stopped me and asked me to show her my boarding pass before I entered the security line as expected. Than she told me that I had 3 bags and therefore had to go downstairs to check one. I than said that I planned on just checking my bag at the gate. She said ""downstairs"". And I said ""wait can't I check it at the gate"". She said I wasn't allowed through until I went downstairs. So I went downstairs. The staff were very unhelpful and the lines were ridiculous. When I finally checked my bag. I went back up to the security line. The same worker as before was trying to tell me I couldn't have 2 bags and had to check the other (which clearly isn't true, your allowed a personal bag and a carry-on bag). They were both small backpacks so its not like they were big. I think she may have been trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm a freshman in college and look like I don't know what I'm doing. I'll give her the benefit of doubt and say maybe it was miscommunication though as she wasn't clear and kept just saying ""check bags downstairs"" and wouldn't really answer my questions. I then was in the security line. The signs said 15-20 minutes. This was at 9.05, so an hour before my departure time. The line was moving pretty slow, so along the way I asked a couple of workers if they could help me since my flight was pretty soon. They said no, which was understandable considering I still had 30 mins until boarding started, and the lines were only ""15-20 minutes"". At about 9.25 (boarding starts at 9.40, ends at 9.50), I was still pretty far back in the line and it was clear the line wasn't moving. I then again asked the original TSA worker to help me as she was right next to me at this point. She said ""I can't do anything about it. If boarding starts in 10 minutes the gate is already closed."" First off that doesn't even make sense. The gate closes after the boarding ends. Anyway I kept on going through the line, and I was pretty close when it was 9.40 (boarding start). However, the line was going very slowly. I got to the point where you put your bags onto the belt at 9.45, 5 minutes before the gate closes. Since there were so many people putting their bags on their, my bags weren't being moved into the moving line. I asked the worker if she could put my bags in quickly since I had a flight to catch. She just stared at me with a blank stare. A kind man and a woman behind me asked me when my flight boards. I explained that the boarding started 5 minutes ago. They both said that it was ridiculous that they had seen me ask multiple employees to help and nobody did. The 2 people in front of me heard the conversation and let me move in front of them to try to make my flight. I got out of security at 9.48 and sprinted to the gate. When I got there at 9.51, there were 0 employees at the gate, and none at the surrounding gates either. I eventually found an employee at a gate 6 away from mine. He was the most helpful employee of the day. He told me to go to customer service and helped me get a new free ticket for a flight 4 hours later. It turns out that the flight left 10 minutes early and they closed boarding early as well. Terrible service. I'd rate them a 0/10 if possible.",-1,EWR

I tried to watch a movie with noise cancelling headphones on and could not hear it over the music. It also makes it difficult to hear the announcements. Not everyone likes the same music so I don't know why we have to be subjected to music we do not want to hear. I hate to fly out of here but sometimes I am forced to use this airport and I always dread it. Why does the anyone think it's a good idea to create a more chaotic environment.

2019-10-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,"lazy, entitled, abusive, rough and mean",True,"  I have never reviewed TSA or any other airport for that matter, but these people are so abusive in their perceived 'power' over the public that it is inconceivable to not give a review. The majority of the TSA staff at Newark are not just rude ... they shouldn't be assisting people in any capacity whatsoever. The initial 'greeter' was a woman that glared and yelled at every one filling up their baskets in the most hostile fashion that people seemed to be cowering. As you moved thru the line she intermittently yelled at older travelers if they moved to slow, or used the wrong kind of basket (although she didn't do anything to replenish the 'correct' ones to her bays) and generally terrorized the guests. It was actually so absurdly over the top that it was humorous at first until you passed thru the scanner and made it to the other side where the remaining 7-10 TSA employees (definitively more TSA employees than in any other airport that I've seen at any one time), loitered and talked amongst themselves and pointedly refused to assist anyone. They would not make eye contact or converse with guests who were trying to catch a flight. If you can avoid Newark airport in general (all Union restaurant and bartenders) ... and of course I had to wait to review because the wifi is so useless...you'll be happier, but that is just the icing on the cake. If you can avoid Newark TSA 'agents' .. lazy, entitled, abusive, rough and mean. I'd say you've dodged a bullet. I feel like someone should report them to their superiors .. but to have hired those people in mass makes me think whomever is in charge wouldn't care to improve.",-1,EWR

Lack of proper signage to tell you where you should go. Worst of all is the rude TSA staff that feel the need to hurl snarky insults to the taxpaying passengers who pay for their salaries.

Even many of the washrooms are only portable chemical sheds. The screening lines are long and the supervisors rude. I waited 45 minutes in one line only to be told to move to another due to my hip implant where a full body scan was required. It would have been helpful to have some signs or instruction.

Tried to get a quesadilla at Philley Cheesesteak. No signs or indications where to place your order, pay for your order, or where to sit with your food. When asked food service staff they were rude with directing me as if it should be obvious that you pay for your food across the aisle at a separate counter. I placed my order and it took 45 minute to get a quesadilla only after I called the lengthy wait to the staff’s attention. I received a text that my food was ready 1 hour after placing the order. Whoever thought of this concept for food service should be fired. I’ve never written a review for anything before. This experience was so bad.

They wouldn't let go of my mothers insulin at security, almost breaking and ruining her cooler insulin bag and damaging her insulin and making a mess of her two carry ons. They made her stay there for 30 minutes because the staff had never seen a cooler insulin bag like that. Because of TSA ignorance she almost lost her insulin and her flight. Secondly, a United bag drop personnel was making such a big deal about me getting their paper tags that were on top of the counter for passengers to use, saying that I should have asked, so why the heck is it on top of the counter without a sign to ask for it? If we paid for the tickets including luggage we have the right for tags so tags are included and what we paid for.

I understand there were weather problems, but even Americans were required to speak to a border agent. Had US passengers been granted entry with the machines, then waiting wouldn't have been so bad. In the end, filling the card was useless and the machines served essentially to take your picture and to tell you to report to passport control. It took one hour just to leave the airport. Signage was confusing, border agents weren't very friendly and the layout is illogical. I asked the supervisor, apparently everyone speaks to a border agent. Then why are there machines? Leaving, security was a bit slow. I will do my best to avoid this airport in the future.",-1,EWR

Coming into immigration was a disaster. First we had to wait in a line to scan our passports and fingerprints, and customs form, we had already filled out a hard copy on the plane, and a picture. Then we had to wait in line over an hour, it wasn't particular full, just not enough windows open. Then we got to the immigration officer, a nice guy, he scanned our passports, which we had already done, he took our finger prints which we had already done, he took our picture which we had already done, and looked over our customs declaration hard copy, which we already had filled out on the first machine. No reason at all to have to wait twice in line for the same thing. After collecting our luggage we had to wait in line again for about 20 minutes just to pass thru the customs officer, only 2 officers were there, before we could exit. It took over two hours from leaving the plane till exiting the airport. That is after a 8 hour flight.",-1,EWR

The queues were ridiculous, on departure things were no better, 4 hours to spare so decided to gave a meal and a drink, the prices for both are ludicrous, a steak with no accompanying fries or anything was $47 (before we start with the tipping con) a single beer comes in at over $10 and every bar or food outlet has identical pricing !

2019-08-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,airport does not have enough wheelchairs,False,"  Senior Citizens - Expect the worst at Liberty Newark.. I am a 79 year old man. I was traveling with my wife who is 73 years old. Both of us have mobility issues and therefore we had tickets that allowed us to avail wheelchair facility at the airport. (I was traveling from Mumbai in July.) To my utter disappointment, the airport does not have enough wheelchairs. We were made to wait for a significantly long time to get one, when we needed two. I made it known to the airport official that we will not leave unless my wife also gets one. To this, the official was absolutely rude, rude to the point that he made me stand up from the wheelchair that I had and asked me, in a ruder tone, to wait further. Without an ounce of respect for our age, and consideration of our disabilities or the fact that we have been traveling for more than 16+ hours, he left us to our fate. A young attendant after some time finally came to our rescue with another wheelchair which I was given, while my wife walked slowly behind. If the airport cannot take care of senior citizens, particularly from far off places, then the airport is in no position to boast of service quality. Expect the worst when you travel to or from this airport. Having less facilities is understandable, but a rude behavior from officials should simply not be tolerated. The staff need a lot, a lot of training with customer interaction. This is not my first time traveling to a foreign destination. We have travelled to 12 nations of the world.

Hundreds of people came in from various flights but initially only 3 operatives were working. Eventually ( and I mean eventually!!)another 3 desks opened. While I understand the need for security , it was very frustrating to take 2 hours to go through immigration after an 8 hour flight when all it would have taken would have been more operatives being employed who could deal with passengers more efficiently and effectively. On the other hand, on return to the airport to Heathrow, security staff were laughing and joking with children and passengers and shouting out which computer games were the best which seemed to me inappropriate for such an important role.

Not to mention unbelievably rigid. Nowhere outside of Newark airport does the TSA so unapologetically take your belongings. For instance, they threw my Nalgene water bottle in the garbage because it had the tiniest amount of water. Face wash that I was allowed to bring on the plane on the last flight was thrown in the garbage. It’s slow, chaotic and unfriendly. What is management doing to these people that they operate at such a low performance level? From the moment you step in the airport your accosted with terrible customer service.

Have had far more pleasant and efficient experiences at airports in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in supposed 'third world countries' than at this abomination. I am a native born American fluent in English, yet there was virtually no signage, unjustified delays, no information, my gate and departure time was changed three times, exceptionally inefficient management of space (inadequate space for TSA and always between gates), filthy and overcrowded bathrooms, an obnoxious and distasteful obligatory system for making an order at a restaurant, pathetically high prices, overworked and insufficient quantity of staff (who were also largely uninterested in being helpful), exceptionally poor connections between terminals. Over an hour for the luggage to make it from the plane to the baggage rotisserie. Then a chaotic and poorly designed means to re-deliver baggage for a connecting flight. There were a good number of plugs and outlets to recharge a laptop of phone. That is literally the only redeeming thing I can say about my four hour misery in this airport. Avoid at all costs.

The security line was a mess with rude agents and the process took way too long, most of the restaurants in the terminal were closed and the ones that were open were way overpriced, and the terminal had no air conditioning in the middle of July. It was like an oven in the terminal and there was one dingy old fan for ten gates. Also the carpet was dirty and there weren't enough seats.

Got in at 11.00pm after a 9 hour flight and had to get another 5 hour flight 5 hours later, so we needed a place to sit and relax. The seating is very limited. Most airports provide rows of seats, however this airport has replaced the normal seating with large tables with limited seating that is somehow meant for ipad surfing at the tables and there seems to be a charge for this. The few row of seats that still exist are divided by metal arm rests which prevent the overnight waiting folks from stretching out, and definitely prevents mothers from holding babies and children, a very family unfriendly airport. It simply does not accomodate families at all. The alarm at the gate door keeps going off. It has been going for over an hour. What good is an alarm if the staff does not come and investigate. Customs requires a checkin at a kiosk. We tried four kiosks, and none if them actually worked. One man was helping people, and he was nice enough, but he couldn't get them to work either. He said the internet connection was slow and they have problems with this all the time. Really? Fix this! We finally managed to get the 5th kiosk to work, but it took us about 20 minutes. Then there was the line for the agent. Then there was the line for the luggage. Then it spit us back out into the unsecured area and we had to go back through TSA. The food look awful and was horribly overpriced. We waited to purchase something on the plane. We weren't about to buy poor quality overpriced food at this airport. Bathrooms were filthy. The tables with the ipads are filthy underneath. The chairs are bolted to the floor so apparently they can't get in there to clean. The way the seating was arranged is not family friendly.

I cleared customs, rechecked my baggage on the green route and tried to take a shuttle to Terminal C. it didn't work. I was told to walk by a customer service agent. So I did, and found that I had to go through an entire security line again! By doing so they took three hot sauces from Trinidad I brought back for family and friends. I did not think at any point I'd be going through security again so I had put it in my carry on after buying it at a shop at the gate in POS.

That was the last good thing that happened at this airport. All the bad things that happened: 1) Passport Control/Customs: Huge line, took nearly an hour to get through, because half the kiosks were closed or broken and half of the agents booths were unmanned. The staff providing directions were unintelligible most of the time. 2) Baggage check: Signs directing me to transfer my bag after customs were confusing. I ended up in a line for United Air when I needed to be in another terminal. 3) Inter-terminal transportation. Train between terminals was down, and nobody could determine if it would be up any time soon. Worker yelled at people that they could walk, with no other info. 4) Signage - sucks. 5. Walk between terminals was long, over broken sidewalk. Because of that (and #3) I nearly missed my checkin. All in all, a great airport to avoid.",-1,EWR

Any words to describe it are not for publishing was they are so awful and profane. The personnel are not a happy and helpful bunch. They're doing you a favor to be there. You feel that you are imposing on them. The airport is dirty and poorly kept up. The USA is the only country that I know of where luggage trollies are rented. Welcome to the USA. This is not what we are all about. Customs is a joke. They're understaffed, unfriendly and belligerent. The redcoats (non customs officials) herd and yell at you like cattle and remind me of what my grandparents told me when speaking of concentration camps. This is Newark International for better or worse. Mostly for worse.",-1,EWR

While they have updated the terminals over the years customer service is poor to non-existent. Recently flew back from Barcelona on Sat. 5/25/19 (holiday weekend) and trying to get through US Customs was not only a nightmare but a national disgrace. At 3pm only two (2) yes that's right 2 were on duty to check through hundreds if not thousand of flyers entering the USA. A near riot nearly broke out due to the people having to wait over 2 hours for no other reason than poor staffing. The agents on duty were slow as sap in January (apparently they deal with this low staffing all the time) and have no sense of urgency in getting folks through customs. I was told this was normal staffing levels. As an American I gotten use to poor service in public transit but it does leave a sour taste with foreigners entering the US for the first.,-1,EWR

That's unfair only to the extent that other airports probably don't deserve to be denigrated by even being included in the same category as Newark Liberty. It's dirty, inconvenient, dated and inefficient, staffed by a lot of incompetent and unfriendly people, and the area around it is bleak even for a generally bleak spot like northern New Jersey. They should just flatten this place and route traffic through other places that care about doing a decent job and know how to do it.",-1,EWR
2019-05-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,single worst airport,False," The single worst airport I have ever experienced. Nearly 1000 passengers entered customs at about the same time, and there were only two agents to process them. After an hour of waiting, I traipsed all over Terminal B trying to follow instructions for Baggage Control, another security check, getting to Terminal C, etc. Whoever designed the signage for Newark Liberty should be fired. Roughly three hours later I arrived at my gate to discover that they were already boarding a bus, where 50 people were stuffed shoulder to shoulder for about 20 minutes before boarding the plane. In my hours at the airport, only one employee was either kind or helpful. The others I dealt with were unbelievably rude and unhelpful. I am an older woman, and I hope I have never treated a fellow human being the way I was treated. The bottom line: if you can avoid Newark, do so at all costs. I certainly will.",-1,EWR
2019-05-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,,2.0,2.0,Security set up is not fit for purpose,True," Security set up is not fit for purpose. I waited in line for one hour for security checks. There were only three aisles in operation, one for first class/priority for all international flights from terminal 2. And once through security the gates area is horrible. Restroom facilities aren’t big enough for the number of passengers (just four stalls in the men’s, with the lack of privacy and cleanliness typical of bathroom facilities in the US). Oh, and when I arrived here the other day from London I was stood in line for 2.5 hours at immigration. Just a hopeless and depressing way to enter and leave NYC. It makes London Heathrow seem positively heavenly by comparison!",-1,EWR
2019-05-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Newark is an embarrassment,False,"  Well, I can say at the least, Newark is an embarrassment. We arrived at terminal A, and had a connecting flight to Frankfurt, Germany. We had to navigate to terminal B, specifically gate B62. I looked up for the signage, directing me to the appropriate terminal. Terminal B was down a level, and by bus, the signs said we would be arriving. We took the elevator, as we had some carry-on luggage and the stairs looked, precarious. I could quite possibly be over-exaggerating, but we waited at this old elevator for what seemed like a solid 5 minutes, before the door opened. It was like a time warp, back to the 80's inside this elevator. We exited and saw a bus. As I approached the airport worker, I asked her if this bus went to terminal B. Very rudely, she asked me which gate. I told her gate B62. She said that this was not my bus, no bus goes to B62, and that I would have to go back up to terminal A, take a right, and another right and then I could get to terminal B. Confused because of the signs I just read, directing us to this bus, we turned around. Not wanting to wait for the slow elevator, we opted for the stairwell. The stairwell leading back to the terminal, was completely atrocious. Bird wire fencing for walls, trash, dirt and cigarette stench enveloped the narrow and steep stairs. I am not sure if they are even OSHA compliant. There was room for only one direction of travel up and down the stairs. A person walking down would have to stop, mash up against the bird wire fencing and wait for them to pass by. So we take a right and then another right, and we see a sign for terminal B and an arrow, but the ""B"" has been painted over, as if to signify that terminal B was not in the direction we were directed to go! We were basically leaving the airport, by following this rude airport workers' advice. I asked one of the security workers in that hallway if we could get to terminal B this way, and he rambled off on some rude tangent about can't I read the signs? Totally rude and un-helpful. Not wanting to miss our flight by leaving the terminal, we back tracked to the area we began from, in hopes to see another poorly illustrated sign. Luckily a flight attendant was sitting close by, and saw the look of confusion on our faces. She informed us that yes, we were supposed to leave the terminal, take the sky train to terminal B, gate B62. Off we went. When we got off the train, all I could see was a long line of passengers, waiting to get through security. Regrettably, we had to join that line. The line was formed with mis-matching, dated stanchions, crooked and not even wide enough to pull a carry-on through. In the back ground, all I could hear was security officers yelling and belittling passengers for having candy in their bags, over and over again. Publicly shaming these poor foreign passengers, in my country, which I love and have served and protected. I was so embarrassed. Is this how America treats people? First impression is the most important and this was a complete nightmare. Thank goodness my flight to Frankfurt was delayed, because I would not have made it home that day. We got through security and all the passengers at gate B62 were still standing in a long line, waiting to board. The entire airport was dark, dank, out dated and just rude. It was so refreshing to arrive (late) at Frankfurt, where there is order and cleanliness and polite people. Get your crap together, Newark. You are a shameful experience. Never again. Never.",-1,EWR
2019-05-14,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,Dingy. Tired. Dated,False,"  As other reviews state, we should be embarrassed. Upon entering terminal B [International Terminal, where one might think we'd showcase our best side], there is woefully poor signage to direct you to you check-in area. Then, after asking 2 airline associates at 2 different areas, we located the SAS counter. Next Security! 1hour, 40 minutes. Nope, not exaggerating. And to add insult to injury, several other passengers in the line stated this was 'the norm'. Frankly, it took less time to drive to the airport from Pennsylvania! Not acceptable. Then into the departure terminal. Dingy. Tired. Dated. Ok, we'll feel better after a bite and a drink. Alas we had exactly 1 choice. Shameful. Could I be more aggravated? Yes I could. 2 bratwurst, 2 draft beer, tip. Go ahead, guess. Nope. OK: $52.00. Incidentally - this is my 14th flight this year, lest you think this is a random complainer. The saddest part is the view this airport gives to our foreign visitors. Yes, I am deeply embarrassed. I see a new terminal is in planning to replace Terminal A. That and B can not happen fast enough. Shame on us.",-1,EWR

There was no seating option before check in, upper and lower decks have been cleared of virtually all seating, not even anything for the elderly. Also, the only indicator for where our checkin would be, Iceland Air, was a tiny logo on a carry-on bag size check stand. At the gate, the options for dining were frighteningly limited. Outlets for charging are limited and taken up quickly as well. I remember EWR being much more gracious 15 years ago. It is rapidly approaching 3rd world standards, with which I am also acquainted.

I travelled on an ESTA from the EU with an EU passport. The waiting time was 2.5 hours. There was no apology, no sense of staffing more booths, no facilities for elderly people to take a seat, drink water, use the toilet without losing the position in the lines. We had just come off an 8 hour flight from Heathrow. How on earth does the self proclaimed ""greatest country on earth"", one of the richest nations on our planet think it can treat people like that is completely beyond me. The staff - true to form - treated the situation as a normal everyday occurrence (which is even more concerning). The eventual mini interview was conducted in the standard cold, non-apologetic way. I'm so underwhelmed and angry about how this major airport represents the wonderful American people I got to know.",-1,EWR

I waited two hours to be seen. There were 3 members of border staff and at one point 1 went on a break. I missed my connection and had to fly the next day. The red coats who had the badge “here to help”, when I said I was going to miss my connection said” not my problem honey”. Firstly having so many people queuing for so long is a health and safety issue, hardly a welcome to the US. I fly frequently worldwide and have never experienced such treatment and rudeness by staff supposedly there to help. This airport is a disgrace and management should employ more staff and certainly train them in manners. It is customer service at the end of the day.

At the arrival I found extremely long queues at the immigration desk for ETSA (I think we have been standing for about 2 hours after a 9 hours flight from Europe arrived at night). I departed from the terminal B and here I found the same story: incredibly long queues at the check-in and at the security and baggage check. (Fortunately I arrived 4 hours in advance) In addition the guys at the security were really bossy. What to say about the kiosks selling food at the terminal? Actually there were only 3 or 4 selling common junk food for an exaggerated price. There's no shopping area at all at that terminal. In other words an old, neglected, unpleasant and inefficient airport that you could never expect to find in the US. Scandalous!! I think I'll never fly again to this airport.",-1,EWR

The return trip shows how poorly this airport is run. Landing late at night, our baggage came suprisingly quickly, but then we needed to take the tram to get to our car. They only run one train at night between the terminals, and then they force you to get off and get on a different train to get to the parking lots. The first train took much longer and was very crowded. It was worse for the second train. We waited a good 10 minutes as the crowd grew, and very nearly did not get onto the hot crowded car. The pre-pay facility at the parking ramp was in poor repair. It took a long time to figure out where to touch the screen to get the buttons to work, (down about an inch from the buttons themselvs!). There were only two lanes open to exit the ramp, and one of them was blocked by another car who couldn't get the automatic ticket to open the gate.

The girl who was checking us in at the BA desk in terminal B did not want to be there and made no effort to connect with us, grabbed my bag from me as if I were an inconvenience to her, and as a nervous traveller these kind of experiences just make it worse. She was asked by an employee if she was being nice and her response with an eye roll was ‘trying to be’. I encountered very few polite people in this establishment and genuinely do not want to fly to this airport again. Toilets were absolutely disgusting, any time you ask for assistance with anything you are treated with a sigh.",-1,EWR

Pretty swift, but know you’ll be waiting in some lines. I went to check a bag that came to be one pound over the limit. The kiosk told me it would be $225. We were rushing, so I paid it. In shock that I just paid that and didn’t even ask questions, we looked around where to go next. A woman working there came up to me and asked if I wanted her to put on my bag ticket. She noticed it said heavy and asked how heavy it was. The staff member immediately took me through lines to get a refund. It was so kind of her to do that for me - it absolutely made my day and started out my vacation on such a more pleasant note. I am extremely grateful for her! Thank you!",1,EWR
2018-09-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,worst airport experience in years,False," We traveled through Newark twice in Sept. 2018. Unfortunately, I have to report that this is the worst airport experience in years, and we are world travelers. The worst part of the experience was the awful, terrible, confusing and misleading signage. I would really suggest they hire a consultant to review and drastically improve the signage. There were no maps that I could find in the airport, and I had to ask multiple people, often other travelers, to try to find our way around. The worst was trying to locate the SkyTrain. The small signs appear to have an arrow at the end of them, so we followed those, and ended up nowhere. After asking, we were directed upstairs. Then, I think on the 3rd level, there are conflicting signs, one with an arrow down and another, on the 2nd level, with an arrow up! Again we had to ask where to find it. When we finally got to the station, there was a nice official man, who helped make sure we got oriented to the right train. Even on the way back, we had to ask directions again, because we again got confused by the conflicting directions. All of this could have been avoided with clear maps and well-designed signage. On our return from an international flight, we had the misfortune of having to go through customs and security there. It was ridiculously redundant, I think we had to complete 5 lines before getting out, and it was so slow we almost missed our connection. After completing immigration, we had a very slow and inefficient security clearance before getting on our next flight. It seems more personnel are needed, or else streamlining the process.",-1,EWR

Probably 300 of them, including me, foreign passport holders who were directed to one open processing point, while our US friends sailed through their multiple open gates. After an hour in the queue another international plane arrived, probably from China. At this point someone decided to let the international queue go through the US processing gates.

It is disgusting, the bathrooms always have huge lines and are gross as is the concourse. My husband and I are TSA approved, the lines are beyond a joke. The TSA agents are rude to put it mildly. I am 51, had a hip replacement 18 months ago, not the average age for this surgery however I get spoken to and treated like I am a moron especially when I line up at the revolving body scanner. It took 20 mins to get through on Sat 8/17/18. Is this seriously the best an airport with mass footfall can do? These people are jobs worth, have no patience and are condescending. Came from Tampa this morning, the experience was so different. Airport is spotless, TSA agents are polite and for the first time ever whilst lining up to go through the body scanner I was asked in a friendly manner if I had metal in my body, it took no time at all to get through.

My husband and I arrived to Newark on Thursday July 19, 2018 all was good. On Friday July 20th my 3 kids were coming in. They called us to let us know that they arrived and would be in baggage claim. Coming into the airport we saw terminals A, B and C. They were in C. To get to them with your upper and lower roads was the most craziest thing I have experienced. We kept missing how to get to terminal C going slow and reading the signs. Then trying to get back into the airport it put us out of the way no wehre close to where we were. After 45 minutes circling the airport and almost getting stuck in the parking garage we got to them. Coming back home we flew out of Philadelphia. A piece of cake!

2018-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,extremely poor signage,False,"  One of the worst airports I have transited through. In the past, travelled through here en route to Florida. It seemed ok at the time although just before I boarded my connection I realised my wallet had been stolen. The security staff I contacted, and lost and found personnel were extremely unhelpful. It left a bad impression. I was reluctant to book a flight passing through Newark again, but it has been several years so I thought it may have improved - it is worse. This time around, the customer service aspect has not improved one bit. The airport has three terminals. If you are arriving from outside the US (even if you're not staying), you'll need to clear customs and go through security etc. all again. Also be aware that because there is no ""within airport"" transit area, you need appropriate ESTA to clear customs. There is extremely poor signage for transit passengers. To go between terminals, you hop on the AirTrain which only takes a few minutes. I had plenty of time to kill so explored each of the terminals (pre-security). I would suggest getting your food and drink (if you have time) before checking through security. At terminal A, there is very little beyond the security check point. There are few toilets too, and the terminal is very crowded. So if you can put off checking through to this terminal till you absolutely need to, I would. Terminal C is a lot bigger, and more choices for seating, food and drink but it is also a lot more expensive, even the fast food joints. The cheapest burger place charges about $8 for a burger, another 4-5 bucks for fries, and there was one poor soul making the food for everyone so long waits. I overheard a customer saying ""sorry, I know you're busy, but I've been waiting 45 minutes for a chocolate milkshake"". Both Terminal A and C security check staff were rude, and would not answer people's questions. At terminal C in particular, there are confusing TSA lines ups. Nobody knows where to go, there is no signage. None of the staff will answer a question, just point you towards another area or queue. There is really nowhere to get food/drink at terminal C until you pass security other than a dunkin donuts. If you have time to spare, go along to Terminal B or A, there are a few other choices like Manchu Wok, Subway, Wendy's etc. Given the airport is so busy, there seem to be routine flight delays. Both my flights out of Newark were delayed. If you have a tight schedule, factor in a couple hours just in case. Also pay attention to your gate. The gate for my return flight changed three times within an hour and there was no announcement in the lounge. It just happened that people were looking at their airline App which updated them. If you have a choice, I would not fly through Newark if I could transit through somewhere else. It's a shame as I like flying with the main carrier using Newark (can't name in this post) but the aggro of going through this place again puts me off entirely.",-1,EWR

I counted over 30 desks and only SIX were manned. The wait to get checked was over an hour, and finally when I did manage to get seen, the arrogant Inspector, chewing gum and looking over my shoulder, told me he couldn’t get my fingerprints. When I asked him why, he still didn’t look my way, but told me to try again and press harder on the screen. When this appeared to also fail I asked him what I was supposed to do. He asked if I was wearing hand cream, to which I replied no. When further pressed, he suggested my hands were “too dry”. What utter nonsense. All the latest fancy technology and it required wet or sweaty hands to get fingerprints taken. I told him I had no problems before, to which he just glared at me. I asked if he had any wipes, so I could clean the screen - which seemed to irritate him more. Finally, I took out my own wipes (luckily I had some, or I would have licked each finger - most unhygienic!). I dampened each finger with the wipes, placed them on the screen and bingo! He practically flung my passport at me. I’m 79 yrs of age, travelling alone, and usually am quite tolerant, but Newark airport has the most rude, arrogant, unhelpful staff and since there was no good reason for holding me up, and worrying my waiting family, I will happily never fly into there again.",-1,EWR

I traveled through this airport going to Spain. I agree with most of these reviews I have read on this site. I experienced long lines because of unprepared TSA officers, not adequately staffed and listened to their bickering between themselves. The TSA officers were rude and seemed not able to exhibit even the smallest of cordial interaction. As we went through customs some of the police officers also exhibited similar behavior. I understand the need for the security checks but there needs to be some component of decency and civility in the process. I intend on never utilizing this airport again and am embarrassed for foreigners visiting the United States and thinking this is how Americans act. It is clear that the TSA and some of the police officers have no checks on their behavior. A simple lesson of manners would serve them well.",-1,EWR

This was by far the worst experience either one of us had of an airport. Both being in our 30s, we have travelled a fair share and seen different kind of airports in different countries, but this was shocking! Our carrier (SAS) informed us to be at Newark airport approx. 1,5-2 hours before departure. But since the weather was a bit off in N.Y.C, we decided to go out to the airport almost 3 hours before departure at 11.30 pm in the evening. As luck would have it! The airport is extremely disorganized, with few signs pointing you in the right direction and not even informative calling in the loudspeakers. Instead, airport staff were going around yelling and shouting seemingly important info, such as that some passengers had to go ahead in line or were missing. Absolutely shocking. The security process itself was also a joke, and very, very time consuming. We stood in line for our security check 1 hour and 45 minutes. The procedure was very shattered and whimsical, and the staff was borderlining on being rude, screaming in peoples faces to remove their shoes. Why not put up a bunch of signs in different languages that explains the security process instead, so people can read and understand while standing in line? That would save both time and frustration. Not all security checks are the same either. All in all, being spoiled by the efficent security and customs in Copenhagen and Amsterdam, it was a nightmare going through Newark airport. There's certainly room for some massive improvements, and hopefully, improvements and effiency are on the top of the list of what to do next at Newark airport. The best advice we can give you, is to be at the airport with very wide time margins. It takes longer than you think (almost forever) and it's not an uncomplicated system.

When I came home from Japan though, it was a completely different experience. The staff were incredibly rude and obnoxious. I was a little confused where I was going and asked an employee for help, she was annoyed that I was confused and yelled directions at me. The other employees were just as rude and the overall atmosphere was unpleasant. Employees wouldn't look people in the eyes, they were on their phones, and leaning on walls/objects lazily. The staff at TSA were horrible, screaming directions at people and were just rude in general. I never experienced such rudeness from TSA/other staff at any other airport I've been to.

However, when you are at a Newark Airport restaurant early evening with 2 hours to spare and told that at 8.30pm they are no longer serving food, and that the only other restaurant in the airport serves food in plastic plates (at $15 for a burger and kettle crisps), you will be let down, no matter what your standards are. I was travelling from Newark terminal B. The queue for security was also appalling, the staff came across as disorganised and did not direct passengers properly so there was a long delay. To add to the bad experience, taxis to Newark from Manhattan do not have a fixed fee so if you are stuck in traffic for 1 hour you could end up paying easily double the usual fare, I would recommend the train to and from Penn Station to Newark airport if you are travelling light, guaranteed price and more reliable than getting stuck in the Holland tunnel during rush hour in a taxi. America, you need to sort out your airports and keep your restaurants open until the last flights of the day and start adding shops, you have a captive audience there, so it's no brainer!

I spent a long time looking for a map/directory that displayed restaurants and shops, and I never found it. I visited places to eat and found that the prices are ridiculous for what you are getting. The Wifi Connectivity was really poor, it would suddenly cut on and off at times. The ratio of passengers to staff is awful. It took me 30 minutes to get halfway through the travel assistance line. There was only 2 airline staff for so many people that needed assistance, which made the lines so slow. They need to hire more staff.",-1,EWR

I had a six hour layover and it was one of the worst airport experiences of my life. My first thought was the general filth of the place. Staff were rude and unhelpful. The queues were massive and poorly laid out so that they blocked other traffic. Amenities are very limited beyond security. I had a gate change that was not announced. While I was in the toilet two airport workers came in bantering with each other with 'threats' and foul language which I at first thought was intended for me. The chairs were terribly uncomfortable making any rest impossible. In the future I will pay extra for tickets to avoid Newark.,-1,EWR

Horrible ground service. Luggage came out 45 minutes after we landed. Then there was only 2 officers for the customs. I missed my connecting flight because of that.

However it continuously stikes me how bad Newark Airport is at handling security and basic customer service. The lines are up to an hour long and while some of the staff is trying to keep the mood up the term customer service is not something most staff has encountered.

",True," Newark and the TSA agents that work there in particular are an absolute joke and a national nightmare. Do everything in your power to avoid this airport. I just stood through an hour and thirty minute wait on a security ""training day"" (which is somehow happening every single time that I fly through this airport, I have never gotten through security in less than 30 minutes in 3 visits). Many of the passengers on our flight had finally reached the front of the line and were now having our names called out on the intercom. Clearly frustrated by now being on track to miss our flight after arriving hours before our flight, we began pleading with TSA to please hurry up the process as we were going to miss our flights despite being at the airport hours in advance. The TSA woman who was clearly in charge got into a verbal argument with another passenger (not joking), while displaying tremendous attitude, disrespect, and a fundamental lack of empathy. She then ordered a shift change to make a point or spite us or something, further delaying us 10 minutes. There is no standard of professionalism or kindness. Avoid like the plague. Worst airport in the United States.",-1,EWR

Horrendous design, tired and outdated, with dirty restrooms and an appalling restaurant at gate B54. Disappointed not to be told that the 'best' food options were landside, and I did not know that we would not be able to visit any outlets at any other B gate areas once through security. Security queue was slow. I was told iPads did not have to come out of bags (not the same in other global airports). Then I saw a bag being pulled aside from the X-Ray because there was an iPad inside it! TSA agent shouting at a passenger whose tray was being searched, because he was trying to help organise things in the tray to make them easier to inspect. The passenger was forcibly told to get back, then the TSA agent flicked his hands at the man. There's a real problem here with people having some bizarre personal space issues, like every person is out to get them (note - we normal passengers are not out to get you). Food at gate B54 was there worst I have ever seen, anywhere, ever. $14 for 5 dried out chicken nuggets and $9.99 for a beer. The Unusual Times 'restaurant' should be ashamed to even open. Apparently I was the first person today to complain. If it is, people here are far too polite and should rebel at such awful food! Last of all, toilet floors dirty, one sink blocked off, the other one not even stuck down to the shelf, when I pushed the faucet to turn on the water, the whole sink moved.

TSA agents were so rude and not helpful at all. When flying back on my return trip I was asking which baggage claim area to go to and all I was told was to go downstairs. Most TSA agents and customer service representative would not help me at all, if it wasn’t for some young man working on the escalators I would have never found my baggage.

2018-02-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,lacking professionalism and common courtesy,True,"  I arrived at this airport for the first time from international flight originating from Bangkok to Tokyo. This is approximately 20 hours of economy class comfort and Newark was my connection to RDU (Raleigh-Durham). It was also my third security gate passage in that 20 hour span and I had been mostly without sleep for the last 24 hours upon arrival at Newark. Overall, I found the security gate staff at Newark to be among the rudest and worst-behaved non-professionals in my limited flying experience as a passenger. They bark orders like you're in boot camp, and do not allow passengers ample organization time to move through the gate. I was carrying laptop computer and other carry-on bag, and did not wish to separate too far from them while moving through the gate. I was tired, slightly confused and forgot to place my smartphone in my personal items bin. They made a big deal about my forgetting to do this, and I commented back to them about their rudeness. A supervisor was immediately called by staff to investigate me further. I was then subjected to a full body pat-down, including full touching of my midsection. While being subjected to the full pat down, two more times the supervisor was called by staff to further inspect me. Only when I offered a verbal apology to TSA staff for negative comments made about their behavior and lack of common courtesy was I allowed to proceed through the gate. With the exception of the supervisor, who clearly could find no visible violations in my passage, I found all the staff completely lacking in professionalism and common courtesy, and feel they actually went out of their way to make my passage through the gate even more difficult when I responded to their negative and aggressive behavior. On whole, this was the dirtiest, most disgusting aiport I've encountered. The floors are dirty, the restrooms not particularly clean, the staff are rude. I will do my best to avoid ever connecting here again.",-1,EWR

We arrived at Newark at 6.30pm and was down at carousel 2 to pick up bags by 6.45pm. We received our bags around 8.30pm. Many people with small kids and connecting flights with no updates from either Icelandair or Airport employees. Icelandair said it was a carousel issue but no one thought of switching us to the many carousels that were open. When I asked Airport employees for assistance and a Manager, I was shrugged off and told no manager was available.

I bought a through ticket from Penn Station on New Jersey Transit and made the connection at the Newark Airport Station on to the Air Train which connects the terminals. I was using Terminal C, a hub for United. Although it was crowded, the security line moved smoothly. The terminal does not have enough ""lower end"" food services. Seating space is also insufficient. Besides the gate was a separate enclosed section for travelers to be security checked again. This was for travelers to Israel. The checks were unobtrusive and the movement of people were well controlled. On returning back to Newark, although I used the automatic machines to get my passport read, we had to wait in line to have the passport the computer print out examined by an immigration officer. It was a 15 minute wait primarily because only four agents were on duty. The officer was pleasant and wished me in that most wonderful of ways - Welcome back! With that I was in the baggage hall and followed the Exit signs out to the Air Train. At the conclusion of the Air Train ride, you buy the ticket for New Jersey Transit to go to Penn Station. Train staff are there to help you. The C Terminal is big and one has to focus on the signs to ensure avoiding getting lost It was not a hassle to use this airport.",1,EWR

It's not a security line at Newark if the TSA ""agents"" aren't sighing, rolling their eyes, and mocking and yelling at passengers (when we are unfortunate enough to attract their attention. Otherwise they just yell at each other). Recently, they seem to be on some kind of security kick. I have been randomly selected for a security check, or my bag selected for further inspection every time. Now, actual safety and security are great, but what we're getting are pat downs and suitcase inspections where they spill your belongings all over the floor. The security lines are slow and cramped, with limited space to unpack all your liquids/electronics. Another TSA agent specialty is just as you near the front of your line, they will usher you into a different line. I know it doesn't make sense. You have to see it to believe it, but I hope you don't see it. If you fly out of Terminal A in the morning, you get a lovely view of the sunrise over Manhattan. This helps me remember that there is some beauty and joy in our world when all around is darkness. (Look, I get it's not a nice job, worse than the service jobs I've worked, but if I pulled half this behavior I'd have been fired in a minute. More importantly, it's no way to treat your fellow human beings.) The gate staff are pleasant and helpful and always had good experiences there. I'm chalking that up to my airline though, which is why I'm a loyal customer. There are very limited food options. This doesn't bother me because i'm good with a sandwich, but your options are a sandwich or Ruby Tuesday. ""Shopping"" is nonexistant.

Poor technology, hostile united and TSA staff, inept, told to use my app to figure out where and if my flight would land and depart since all terminals said on time. Hours delayed flight never shown on monitors said either on time or closed, staff told me flight had left, when it hadn't even arrived from Hartford. Once it was boarded, later flight was cancelled and then they over fueled flight, and tried to get people off, lack of information, signage, air bus than shuttle to flight, stairs to plane. Tried to leave and drive to my destination but was informed by baggage claim that to get my checked bag could take up to two hours. This airport and many others in America simply should be shut down. It's government, it's the airlines, it's what we have created. I just returned from Japan and all I can say as an American, we should all be embarrassed.

2017-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,it was the worst airport experience,False,"  My family have travelled regularly for years via Newark to Ireland and have come to expect a busy and crowded security area: hence we always allow adequate time for moving through the check in and security. On our last trip we had over 3 and half hours to get though security and I have to say it was the worst airport experience any of the family have endured at any airport. The new and improved system that is now in place at Newark consists of TSA staff yelling at travelers from the moment they join the security line. We were consisting yelled at to ""keep moving"" and ""move on"" despite the line moving as fast as anyone could. It was extremely stressful and totally unnecessary as there was no where to move on to any faster than we were already moving. It was nothing short of abusive and disrespectful. Getting through security in Newark was never pleasant but now the TSA are treating passengers nothing short of cattle to be herded. After 35 minutes of being screamed at my bag was selected for a search. This was no problem except the many staff that were supervising this section of security were extremely slow and uncommunicative. I stood for 20 minutes while the staff avoided all eye contact with the passengers and spoke only to each other. A passenger beside me who was in a wheel chair was visibly upset by the loss of her documents - which the staff appeared unconcerned with. Eventually someone checked my bag, rudely and without any civil communication with me. I can only assume that TSA training is now to treat passengers with distain as that was our experience from the start to the end of getting through Newark security. Occasionally a staff member would single out a lucky passenger who would be allowed to jump ahead in the line or have his bag prioritized in the inspection area. There may have been good cause for both these things to occur but in a system which already treats the passengers with contempt it seemed a random and arbitrary abuse of power. As it stands right now it is inefficient and there is an obvious disregard for passenger experience or wellbeing. When you finally get through security you will be rewarded by extortionate pricing for food and drinks. We all know that food in airports is expensive but Newark takes it to new heights! And forget it if you have a family and try to use the bazaar - it will takes forever and you will need a minimum of 2 adults and even this is still expensive. My advise is avoid Newark if at all possible - I am going to drive an extra hour next time right past Newark - just to avoid the horror! If I could give zero stars I would!",-1,EWR

There is one fast food option, Wendys, and it's in gate B, not A, or C, and if you want to get to any other gate, you have to walk out of security, take a bus to gate B and then go back through security just to get a Wendys burger?

When I said ""please don't throw my bag"" she looked at me, rolled her eyes and then yelled at the crowd ""people hurry up and move forward!""

Particularly arrival, was smooth and with friendly but professional treatment by customs etc. Departing was also quick (very nice that SAS has self-service at the terminal) and security went quick and efficient as well. The airport was pretty calm and not chaotic at all. The only two things I would like, was quicker boarding. The staff was so slow and it seemed very unorganized. And also, why does this airport not have free unlimited wifi? It is something almost everyone uses and something I really value when traveling. I don't understand why such a huge and international hub, do not offer this as a service. Upon arrival, we used the airtrain, which worked really well. My first time at Newark was fine, but this was a pleasent experience.",1,EWR

Immigration and customs were surprisingly quick and even friendly but the EWR staff directing arriving passengers to the appropriate queues were rude and even bordering on offensive. Perhaps someone should remind them that the passengers they were shouting at just endured a 16 hour flight from literally halfway around the world. Nevertheless, baggage claim, even for non priority passengers went pretty quick, so this was a 5-star arrival for me. Departing was another story. I could not imagine how US airports catering to internationally departing passengers have the gall to charge $6 for a cart when Asian airports (even the ""worst"" ones like MNL) offer it as a free service. Check in and TSA security was quick and even courteous, but beyond security for a midnight trans-pacific flight, there were no (not even little) dining, shopping nor lounging options outside of the gate seating. The bars and restaurants were closed and even the snack shop which offered dodgy cold selections closed 2 hours before the flight boarded. No wifi available meant a lot of bored passengers.",-1,EWR

I have been to many airports in Asia and Western-Europe, but Newark is definitely not on the same level with those airports. On arrival, we were confronted with a long line of queues for the paspoort check. We queued for about 1.5 hours. The TSA agents did a good job guiding the queue and kept everyone ""on the leash"" during queuing. But the Homeland Security agents do not have a good work ethic. One of the agents just left his station to chit chat with another agent a few feet away from his post while there was a queue for his counter and ""our agent"" was just casually talking about hockey with another agent while handling our documents. The bagage claim area was overloaded with luggage from different flights. One luggage carousel handled more than two flights at the same time resulting in the luggage from the earlier fights being unloaded and put on the floor, all mixed up. On departure day, I found out that I had to pay $6 to use the luggage trolley! Never ever occurred to me that I had to pay for an airport trolley everywhere in the world. So I decided not to use them. Ground crew was not friendly at all, no smile and didn't even look me in the eye during check in. Beverages and foods were overpriced. A total of $13 for a glass of beer! No wifi available and very limited choice of restaurants. To sum it all up, Newark Liberty airport is just a horrible place to be. Bad service, overpriced foods and beverages (even for American standards), old buildings and probably way beyond its capacity.",-1,EWR

I could not believe that I couldn't buy an alcoholic drink at any of the bar/food outlets with cash. You are required to use credit cards which I won't do when abroad. The staff were totally unhelpful. Our flight was announced as delayed from 7.35pm you 8.00 pm but we didn't start boarding until 8.40pm. No explanation whatsoever, the toilets were also a disgrace. I have always been under the impression that American service and hospitality is second to none. Don't believe a word of it. Do not use UA or Newark airport.",-1,EWR

Terminal C, Self check-in was easy, there was the usual queue for passport control, but nothing too bad. My gate was C80, so I made my way down to the gate, and feeling hungry and I fancied a beer, so called in at one 'eatery' where I was welcomed and sat at a table with an iPad in front of me. A quick glance around told me that every table had a tablet - so I listened while I was told to scan my boarding card barcode and shown how my my name instantly popped up with flight details for all to see - especially as the waiter read my name out quite loudly (which I wasn't terrifically thrilled about in these days of identity theft). I quickly scanned through the menu, the food was astronomically highly priced for even the simplest dish, and beers likewise for ales I'd never heard of. So I fled the place, thinking I'd find a cheaper bar where I could pay by dollar notes, and discuss a choice of food and beers with a friendly barman. But alas, no. Some mastermind of planning had persuaded the airport chiefs of Newark to adopt a full tablet ordering system for every eat and drink outlet. Thirsty, I decided to call in at the Vesper Tavern. At least I recognised the beers on tap, and after my stomach had flipped a somersault at the prices, I decided that I needed a drink, fast. I scanned my barcode again, selected my beer from the menu (note, that the picture of each draft beer shows a full pint - or at least large looking glass of frothing beer), pressed the pay button, and as already mentioned by someone else, spotted the service charge was set at 18%. For what? I'd had no service so far! So I wound it down to 0%, and begrudgingly, I swiped my card (although I'd preferred to have paid in dollars), and waited for my beer to come. Along strolled the waiter with a wimpy looking glass of beer. It certainly wasnt the pint I'd seen pictured on the menu! I sat and observed others coming, and of their dismay at ordering expensive food and drink by tablet. My issue with this is that there's no dialogue between the customer and the staff. Little chance to discuss the food, how you would like the food cooked? Which option would they recommend from experience? Could I sample a beer that I'd never heard of? And if the service was good, then at the end, I'll leave a tip to reflect it - not to have an 18% surcharge lumped onto my bill for something that could have been delivered by a little train on a track, sushi style. I'd love to think that in a year or two I'll re-visit terminal C and all the tablets will have been strpped out and replaced once again by the happy chatter of conversion between customer and bar staff. But somehow, the investment made in this new technology will be made to work. Somehow.",1,EWR

Arrived last evening on United Airlines flight 1051 from Cancun, Mexico. Arrived at 7.35 pm. The information on monitors had incorrect information about what carousel your flight's luggage would be on. In fact all the flights coming in were put on one carousel (# 11) and the other carousels were empty. Even the announcement overhead was giving out incorrect information. There were virtually no personnel around to direct people coming in from all over the world and the signage was very poor. After passport check the chaos really began. The line for customs stretched around the entire baggage area with more and more people arriving it was impossible to know where to go. Again, there was no one supervising or directing people. There was no visible sign for global entry. People started to get desperate and cutting into lines, people were threatening each other and fistfights were imminent. There was no one to even ask what lines to get on. I had to use my cell phone to call Homeland Security to alert them to the increasingly dangerous situation. I will avoid this airport at all costs in the future. Worst airport experience I have ever had.",-1,EWR
2016-11-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,,4.0,0.0,,,1.0,most humiliating experience,False,"  Arriving in Newark airport after a 6 hour flight on November 3rd, 2016 was the most humiliating experience of my life. I arrived on Icelandair flight FI623 at around 7:30. Hundreds of people lined up in long queues for passport check. Only One agent was available for the hordes of passengers. The wait was excruciating. Another agent showed up in his booth, 2nd to last from the right, but took about 30 minutes to get settled in, arranging his fan, walking around, looking up at us and smirking without any sense of urgency. It is obvious the people hired to do this job do not have great work ethics. Another agent came into his booth and left promptly to talk on his phone. By the way, many of the employees were sitting around texting on their phones so maybe you ought to make it a rule that texting or talking on the phone is not permitted during work hours. When departing from Iceland, we encountered a long line upon arrival to airport but we were processed so quickly and efficiently in under 10 minutes.  I will discourage people from using Newark airport from now on. It's an embarrassment the way they treat customers. This airport gives our country a very bad first impression to our first time visitors.",-1,EWR

There was very long queue in immigration but the staff were trying their best to ease out things. Unfortunately at such a busy time there were only two counters open for the non USA passport passengers. Overall it took around 45 minutes to clear immigration. Staff were polite and not overly friendly. Luggage came out by the time I reached the carousel. However its really unfair for passengers arriving from international flights to pay 6$ for a luggage trolley which should actually be free. We exited without any issues and took a yellow cab for the trek into busy Manhattan. Overall much better than JFK.,1,EWR
2016-10-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,,,,best avoided if at all possible,False,"  Newark Airport is best avoided if at all possible. The only reason I use it is that United Airlines flies to the destinations that I need. Security lines are long and the security people can get stressed and be can be abrupt. Recently all of the restaurants appear to have transitioned to a system where you order your food through an iPad situated on your table. Throughout your meal you are bombarded with screens trying to entice you to buy something or other. Service and food quality is mediocre and food prices are extremely high. The best advice I could give to travellers would be:- 1) For international travellers arriving at Newark allow plenty of time if you have a connecting flight as you have to reclaim and recheck your baggage and the time it takes to get through immigration, customs and security can be very long. I usually allow three hours. Try to fly direct and avoid connection at Newark if possible. 2) Join the United Airlines club so you will have somewhere to get out of the noisy and busy terminal and you can get a snack so you can avoid using the expensive restaurants.",-1,EWR

My wife and I flew out of Newark Terminal C Friday and back Sunday. We had no problems. Plenty of seats at the gate with lots of places to plug your phone or laptop in to charge. One thing I noticed, the cheap eat options at EWR are gone and replaced with expensive options. So if your trying to be savvy about spending eat before you go into security. Security was pleasant too and the staff were friendly. One thing terminal C is in bad need of is moving walkways. As when we landed back we arrived at gate C98 which a very long walk with no moving walkways. EWR is still the best airport in the NYC/NJ area.",1,EWR

This morning, the line for the security stretched from one end of the terminal to the other. There were numerous kiosks to check in but the lines were not organized and completely jumbled. And now they have you putting your own bag tag onto your bag - like that is going to save any time whatsoever. If they say be here 3 hours ahead, even for a quick flight to say, Atlanta, be here 3 hours ahead or else you will miss your flight. Guaranteed. Terminal C is absolutely the worst terminal I have ever been in. And I won't even begin to tell you about trying to drive up to the terminal just to be dropped off. I'm sure you can imagine the nightmare. Atlanta may be the busiest in the US but Newark terminal C needs a complete overhaul.",-1,EWR

General view of this airport is that it is old, worn and cramped. Also it was not as clean, as I am used to. It was also poor air conditioning and it was warm. It took quite a lot of time to get from the international terminal via the immigration control and get to the United Airlines domestic terminal. The immigration control was correct, polite and efficient, and can be regarded as a better part of this airport. The seats were simple and not so comfortable. They offer some dining but it was not at standards as I am used to. It was expensive there too. The restrooms was not clean and non-functional.

For Christmas Day travel, there was enough seating for all with power ports and USB ports at each gate. The bathrooms are very clean and maintained at regular intervals.

We had sit again and wait in the plane. Then, they told us that they had no resources to unload the baggages from the plane and we had to wait another hour. Finally, there are way more travelers than what the customs could manage and we had to wait in the side and then we were moved to the line. Because of that we lost our connecting flight. We had 3 hours between arrival and departure which is normally more than enough for a so small airport. The airport is accepting much more flight than they can manage and the customers are who suffer only. The airport attendants did not care at all. In consequence we had to stay the night at the airport outside the security area with nothing to eat and no where comfortable where to seat. They were not willing to lay anything because they said it was a “uncontrollable” situation. We booked the flight a month ago so they knew how many flights were arriving, it was not an uncontrollable surprise. If I can control it I’ll never fly through Fort Lauderdale airport again.",-1,FLL

I had a flight out of Ft Lauderdale today to Cancun to celebrate my 50th birthday with a large group of close friends in Tulum. It’s been raining in all of south Florida for past three days, and due to this, Ft. Lauderdale Airport has closed for the past two days including today. I can understand weather being a major issue resulting in airport closures, but somehow Ft Lauderdale airport is the only airport that has closed. They are currently close and ironically it’s been sunny all day. All of my friends were able to fly out of Miami International Airport which is a 30 minute drive to the south and somehow Miami International did not close at all. And Miami is extremely prone to flooding as it’s lower than Ft. Lauderdale. West Palm Beach airport which is just to the north did not close either. So needless to say, all of my friends are celebrating my 50th in Tulum without me because the airport will not open till tomorrow with the airline not being able to book me another flight for next three days. Worst part is as we are all sitting in the airport waiting for some news, airport staff had no idea what was going on or when they would reopen. I will never fly out of there, heaven forbid it rains a little again and the airport is shut down for a week. What did Miami and West Palm Beach airports figure out what to do that Ft.

Well when we finally got off the flight, we were held in a hallway for 40 minutes until we were allowed to go claim our luggage to take through customs. (Which took 90 min) After that, you have to check your luggage back in. I asked if we should put the liquor we just got from DR in the luggage and was told no, not if it’s sealed. Then we get to security and we’re told we can’t keep the liquor. I tell them to call down to the people we checked luggage in because we asked. First man says let it through. Second guy scans it and tells us either we surrender it, or let him re test it in a machine, but if it fails, my husband and all our belongings will be taken to another room for a recheck and a full body pat down.

Finally, we were led to a place where we could get out bags, which took forever to show up on the carousel, even though the plane had landed over an hour ago. At this point we stood in another line, with our bags, waiting to go through immigration. This line wrapped all around the entire airport, and took another full hour to get through. After that, you have to recheck your bag, then wait in ANOTHER line for someone to check your passport. Then there is yet another line, this one you go through security allá over again. They did not get in any hurry about anything - in fact, it really did appear as if they were trying to take as long as possible on purpose. All of this took more than 2 hours, and I barely made my connecting flight. The plane was about to pull away from the gate, when a super nice airlines employee called them and stopped it so that I could get on.

It took us over 2 and half hours to make it through immigration. It makes the traveling experience horrible. You come back to your country and it's the worst entry system. I believe the only reason this is horrible is most of the international flights are coming from the Caribbean and South America.

When you are done with customs, they make you go through the process of re-entering the airport as if you were doing it for the first time. You have to go through the x-ray machine, get padded down, have them go through your carry on and then hope that items that are safe to carry with you are not seen as unsafe by these bunch of idiots and get confiscated. For the individuals running this place common sense is not in their skills set. Apparently they have never heard of six-sigma.

The extremely rude security women told him that he could go back in line for checking in our baggage to put the necklace in there, though with only 20 minutes to spare and the extreme wait on the lines from the incompetent employees, he would of missed his flight and would of had to wait and PAY for an entire other flight. How can you go home after work knowing that you’ve thrown away someone’s remains because the necklace “resembled a bullet”. Regardless of the fact that we were able to unlatch the necklace, show the remains and it had a religious prayer on it. Avoid airport at all cost.",-1,FLL

When we arrived at the airport early, we were told that we could not check in any earlier than 2 hours before our flight. We spent 4 hours sitting on the floor of the airport, along with over 100+ other travelers, before the Southwest Airlines representative would allow us to even check our luggage. The sign in the airport clearly stated that ‘Baggage May be checked up to 4 hours prior to departure’, yet we were shunned away and told we had to wait until 2 hours prior to departure. So you had a room filled with people sitting on the floor with their luggage because we were being told we could not check luggage until 2 hrs prior to departure when signs posted clearly stated the rule was 4 hrs before departure. I can provide a copy of the sign if needed.",-1,FLL

The floor where you sit has garbage on the floors and you see no one cleaning the area at all. The people at the counters are rude when you ask them a question.

We asked for medical and security assistance on the plane, but none was provided. After de-boarding the plane, we were given a wheelchair. Family members were then instructed to proceed with the wheelchair through custom, through luggage pickup and then through luggage re-check, with little to no assistance. After luggage re-check, we were told we could  not take the wheelchair through TSA to our next gate without airport personnel's assistants. After waiting for over 30 minutes with 9 other wheelchair bound individuals and no one coming to assist, we finally found someone and begged them to help us make the next flight. We made it to the gate just before takeoff. With the exception of the lady that helped us make the gate, other employees were either rude or of no help at all. Even after asking airport security to help us file a report again, we were told to talk to the airline personnel. Not a good experience.",-1,FLL

TSA was extremely rude. When my mother, who is 80 years old, came up to go through the x-ray machine, they asked her how old she was? When she said she is 80, they virtually shoved her toward another lane and said: “you go here without any explanation.” We were then separated. And she stood there and waited for several minutes, feeling humiliated and shaken up until an attendant just came and let her through another gate. It is unacceptable.",-1,FLL

After waiting 10 minutes and in fear of not making boarding due to lines at check point security and staff were rude talking back. I took it upon myself to get her in one. Now we have 2 personal bags and 2 paid checked carry on. I myself have had two back surgeries so I am struggling I passed 2  employees setting on a wall by Auntie Ann Pretzel on a wall just chilling.

The service at terminal 1 was awful. I had to ask for a wheelchair because nobody came to help us. I also needed a baggage cart and none of the more than three baggage handlers moved to help. I had to walk to another entrance to get a cart and the guy there in a very disrespectful way requested $10 just to give me the cart and carry my luggage 20 feet.

I have travelled throughout many airports in the world and this ranks as one of the lowest. There was absolutely no thought or planning put into this thing. Getting to the airport is a hassle as the signs are terrible - especially if you are trying to return a rental car. The guys driving the shuttle buses to and from the rental car location are absolutely idiotic and do nothing but pander for tips. Hint - you can walk faster to your terminal than taking one these buses. The terminals are small, crowded with virtually no shopping and horrible restaurants. The security is a total joke - they make up the rules as I go along and act like Nazi's. I had one idiot tell me that I was wearing the wrong type of underwear for Florida. I am not so sure he just didn't want to pat down my crotch. My wife's purse went missing and security ended up doing an ""inspection"" of it. Our travel cash was in it and we aren't so sure that the guard wasn't trying to take some of it. The restaurants inside the gate are horrible with terrible service and food. This whole place is the lowest of the low. If you need to travel to the area do yourself a favour and go to the Miami Airport it is 100 times better than this monstrosity.",-1,FLL

I was abruptly stopped and was aggressively asked “Where is your ID?” I proceeded to look for it in my bag. I usually get my ID out while I wait in the TSA line. He got more aggressive and said “Does this look like a game to you?” He then told me to check in my baggage. The same bag I was able to carry on with AA from DFW to Fort Lauderdale. When asked for his name, he claimed that his name is “Brian”. However when asked to see his badge, he would not comply. He continued to state “If you don’t like the way you’re being treated, go to a different airport”. I am filing a complaint, because I do not appreciate the way that I was treated. I also could’ve been late for my flight. This type of behavior is not suited to represent your airport.

Never in all that time have I been treated with such contempt and rudeness as I encountered at the pre security Cross Grain Brewhouse in terminal 4. We entered to find very few spare seats and one table for four occupied by one man. My husband who suffers from vestibular neuronitis (a problem with balance) took a seat at the table as he was feeling dizzy. My husband is a Royal Airforce Veteran. He then suffered a tirade from one of the servers who told him he couldn’t sit there until the person at the table had finished his meal. Told him it was rude to sit there and asked ‘who would do that’. She continued with her abuse to myself and my daughter and added that we could not just have drinks, this after making us wait some time for her attention. We are from the U.K., were unaware that it is not allowed to take a vacant seat. This is an international airport where people from around the world with different rules and regulations visit. This woman is a very poor example of customer service, a disgusting ambassador for the airport and America. She left our family extremely upset with her atrocious behaviour. We had just spent two weeks in Florida where until this incident we were treated with respect and great courtesy by everyone we met. They were friendly, and helpful.

I dropped off a friend at terminal 3 a few days ago and at departures they have designed so there's no cover from the rain - this is a place that gets 6 months of thunderstorms a year. What genius came up with this design. The result - everyone sitting in their cars waiting for the torrential rain to stop before getting out to get their luggage out. Talk about adding to what is an airport already at capacity and backed up with check in and security - I blame Spirit Airlines for that. Another thing - there is no decent lounges - this is an area where wealthy people travel through all the time for cruises and yacht trips. I hate Miami airport but at least they have nice lounges there, FLL needs to catch up and sharpen their game. On top of that last time I was there I had no mobile signal (T-mobile) and their WIFI is awful.

We had a layover in Fort Lauderdale and had to exit the airport to go to a different terminal to then re-enter and go through security again, and to top it off TSA wouldn’t let me go through precheck. Meanwhile my initial boarding pass is TSA precheck cleared and I showed the gate agent my TSA number, to which he rudely replied ‘this happens everyday’. If this is a daily occurrence how has this not been fixed yet!? Meanwhile we have to throw out all brand new drinks we bought at our first airport. Then my husband is stopped by security and has to throw out items that were already cleared through our first airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the world. Now sitting at the gate, the seats are covered in filth, trash is everywhere and there isn’t a single worker to be found cleaning the mess. I will never fly through this airport again.",-1,FLL

Terminal 3 was truly disgusting with food and trash littered all over the floors and seats. We didn't want to sit in the chairs and sat on our bags instead because there was food grime everywhere. TSA pre check was closed and half of security was closed leaving us to navigate hours of waiting time. The kiosks at Jet Blue didnt work and again, over an hour wait. When we finally got through and were starving at 9:30pm because of a long day of travel, all of the restaurants were closed or closing and the only thing left was the fast food shake and burger place which was absolutely disgusting - food all over the floor of the kitchen area and trash everywhere.

We are currently flying out of terminal 3 and the carpets are covered in food crumbs, trash, and things are just generally very dirty. It’s so filthy in here it actually stinks. Waiting for flights in airports is normally very annoying but this is so bad I’d actually rather be sitting and waiting on a plane. It’s also in need of some serious updating and tech updates. Oh, and the TSA agent was extremely rude. I got a full pat down and her hand went up my skirt which made me very uncomfortable. She also neglected to direct me to do what she needed me to do, she just stood there until asked her how she wanted me to hold my hands for whatever she needed so I could be done and move along.

All of this showed obvious signs that I had nothing hazardous or trafficking of any products. I have never been more insulted in my life!

We arrived to airport early Sunday morning the 13th at 7:45am. (our flight was boarding at 10:25am). We proceeded to the line for Security since we just had carry on items and was surprised how fast the line was moving. My family went through without a problem but I was detained due to no Identity (no license). The Lead Traffic Controller was notified and arrived within a 1-2 minutes to question me. He was professional and very kind. Because I did not have any identity, He had to get an Identity questionnaire which took only another 1-2 minutes. I could tell he was extremely busy as his Communication radio was going off, but he took it in stride and actually lowered the volume so he could give me his full attention. He called Washington and after answering a few questions I was able to sign the form and go through security. He guided me through the security process, searched my bags. His biggest challenge was finding a female officer to pat me down. He had to rotate some Male officers around in order to free up the female officer. I was amazed how smooth he worked and how respectful the other officers were to him. Finally, I was cleared and was able to reunite with my family. I was most thankful to him and all the staff. They are all working so hard with minimal staff during this difficult time with the Federal Shutdown. On another note, the Airport and bathroom facilities were clean - in one bathroom there was a very attentive worker facilitating the line and keeping the room clean.

This airport is clearly run like a ""government agency"" versus local economic engine or ""pride of our community"". Bathrooms are cleaner and fresher at a municipal sports stadium. As a professional whose job is large campus plant operations it is clear to me airport executive leadership (OPS executive) is not rounding each and every day like they are supposed to be. If they were, they'd see how much is wrong. Just today, flying out of SWA Terminal, the bathrooms adjacent to the B gates had no soap in any dispenser for 8 (yes, eight) sinks.

We landed in terminal 1 at gate C and realized we needed to go to gate E. We didn’t see that on any of the signs so we asked people at the help desk. They told us they had no idea what or where that was! After googling it ourselves, we realized we had to go outside to terminal 3 and leave the airport, this meant that to make our connecting flight we had to go outside and re-enter the airport and again go through security! This was for a domestic flight! I have never heard of such a thing and I have traveled in the US fairly often. This led to a huge line and we almost missed our next flight. There was also no outside bus that we saw that would take us between terminals (we waited where it said to). We had to drag and carry our luggage in the heat. Everyone we encountered seemed rude or had no idea how to answer our questions! I will never fly though here again and that is saying something because a lot of airports are busier and less convenient. Terrible!",-1,FLL

All other countries have a line for local citizens. Where is the loyalty? First, we had to wait to be deplaned because the customs area was full. We then had to wait after passing the jet-way on the hallway. We were then allowed to go downstairs where the ""fun"" began. Have you visited Walt Disney World? Well the lines were just like that. One ""maze"" to get to the automated machines. Then another ""maze"" that eventually will take you behind the machines, around the room and surprised, another room full of mazes. TWO HOURS later we were able to get our luggage. The whole process shouldn't take more than 15 minutes, but like most government jobs, nobody seemed to care. I really feel sorry for the folks that will be traveling during the holidays. I will not fly through FLL ever again.",-1,FLL

For an airport serving such often visited cities and known for hospitality and services, this airport is extremely disappointing in terms of ambience, facilities and services. It needs upgrading and perhaps even overhauling. I travel through frequently and frankly I dread having to use this airport. I do not believe that the authorities are taking feedback seriously. I am a priority club holder, sometimes with long wait time and there is no lounge in terminal 3 where many flights originate and arrive. What kind of airport is this? Please open a hospitality lounge in Terminal three. It is badly, sorely needed.",-1,FLL

TSA had to tell people if they were precheck or not (even though most competent people should know). Then the TSA agent proceeded to open a new line for precheck where the back of the line got moved to the front. The guard who was looking at my ticket needed to make sure I stayed behind the line even though I was with the man in front of me. The Cucina & Co hostess was very rude. When I asked for a cup of coffee she made me get up and walk down to the register to pay, cream, sugar, etc instead of providing customer service by bringing those to me.

The employees are so rude. Yesterday I was supposed to fly out and my mobile ticket wasn't scanning. The employee had me behind the desk using the other scanner by myself. I don't know how to use it and she just kept screaming at me to leave the long security line I just waited in to go stand in an even longer line to get a printed ticket. She never once even tried to help me to make sure I was doing it right. Needless to say I missed my birthday trip to see my family. I was so upset and after talking to several people outside this airport has an awful reputation. I will pay the extra money to fly out of West Palm. The people at FLL do not care about your experience. Everyone I tried to talk to (and I was being very polite) either ignored me or told me ""I don't know"".",-1,FLL

This is the worst airport I have ever been through! I have travelled in many developing countries and been to over 30 countries. This is by far the worst airport experience I have had. It took 3 hours to get through arrivals, the staff were pretty unfriendly and they stressed a lot of people out, especially people that had transits. If you have any other option I would arrive at a different airport. Departure was fine but lack of food after 9.00pm is pretty unusual for an airport in a developed country.

2018-04-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,never use this airport again,False," I flew on a Thursday, believing it would be easier than dealing with the airport on a weekend. I'm sure it was but that didn't mean this was a pleasant experience. It just meant there were less employees on duty. Getting off the plane, we were led to believe we were going to baggage, then customs. Surprise! We had to wait behind 150 or so people to use the kiosks, devices created by Satan himself. Why kiosks? We already filled this information out on our customs papers and our photos are on our passports! The woman in charge sent me to the wrong kiosk where I was asked where I came from. Was she kidding? No. That only took 30 minutes. No big whoop. Next: customs and another huge line. Only 2 counters were open! The customs guy was having a great time chatting it up with passengers and taking his time. Good for him, bad for someone who is about to miss a flight. Next was baggage, where I waited about 10 minutes before being told our carousel had been changed. I waited another 10 minutes when, a staff member finally told me another employee across the way had my bag. Why? I don't know. At the airline counter the representative wanted to know how I was doing. I'm surprised she isn't afraid to ask that question. Then it was on to the TSA. Again, employees asking how you are. Please. The food selections are pitiful. One floor had a Starbucks, a pretzel store and a giant bar. It my be an alcoholic's dream but, no good for anyone looking for something resembling a meal. I will never use this airport again. If it's the only choice, I will go to another island instead.",-1,FLL

2018-04-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,,1.0,worst airport we have ever used,True,"  This is the worst airport we have ever used. After a nine hour flight we were told that there were no buses available. We were left in the aircraft for thirty five minutes. When eventually we were bused to the terminal we saw at least four buses parked up at the perimeter. On entering the building we queued for twenty five minutes for the automatic passport readers, we then walked a distance and had to queue again for a further fifty minutes to go through immigration again this time a manned one. There are numerous desks here but sadly only four were operational, this is shameful to treat people this way. There was a female member of staff walking up and down acting as though she was some sort of principal teacher smirking at the line of passengers and then having a conversation with the immigration people from time to time. She seemed to find the whole thing humorous. I doubt very much that any American citizens would stand for this kind of treatment arriving in a British airport - appalling! Having now spent one hour fifty minutes we arrived at baggage reclaim to find that our luggage hadn't been offloaded! We then waited as per the instruction board for an hour at carousel Number three. Finally our luggage was found going around on carousel number two!, To summarise this airport this airport is not fit for purpose. It is totally degrading to treat fare paying passengers in this manner. Management and staff would do well to remember who keeps them employed!",-1,FLL

After traveling from 10 hours standing up for the long security wait felt like a real health hazard. I think it is a shameful way to treat passengers.",-1,FLL
2018-04-05,0.6,Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,better than led to believe,True," Reviews of Fort Lauderdale Airport have been none too complementary, particularly in relation to getting between terminals and the arrival experience. The airport is undergoing extensive refurbishment to bring it into the 21st century and more humanely manage the 32 million passengers that passed through its gates in 2017. As of March 2018, there's still some way to go. Arrival from LGW on a BA flight started off badly as we were kept waiting 30 minutes until we could disembark. This is commonplace, apparently. A touch of amusement was added to the frustration when some new glass doors just inside the terminal refused to accept a key code. Eventually, they did open and one had a chance to see what the new airport is going to look light: light and spacious, but with the usual long walkways to get to customs and baggage collection. Like other US airports, FLL has Automated Passport Control (APC) which gives passengers the good feeling that getting through customs will be much quicker, but which turns out to be just another level of bureacracy and adding yet more mug shots and fingerprints to the database that the US must have on every entrant. The overall process of getting through customs and baggage collection, plus someone to check that the APC had a stamp on it and another to relieve each passenger, added up to just over an hour. That's not that bad, as many reviews report waits of several hours. Once out of terminal 4, it's then a matter of waiting for the complementary shuttle to take one to terminal one where the car rental is also based. In the end, we gave up with the wait and paid $20 each to a man with a minibus who took us there a lot quicker. For the return trip, we used the complementary shuttle and were impressed by the helpfulness of the driver, who actually got out of his seat to help people on and off with their luggage. Check-in for BA Club World was absolutely fine, but the security check process was made over-complicated by staff putting everyone through the 3D body scanner and insisting that everything (tissues and gum included) were removed from pockets - and giving passengers plenty of attitude if those requirements weren't adhered to. Surprisingly, there's no business class lounge in the international terminal, which seems a huge oversight if FLL wishes to attract premium customers. That said, there was a spacious area prior to the gates with plenty of seats (including rocking chairs) overlooking the runway and a number of food and drink concessions. And there was free WiFi. Unfortunately, some of the staff possessed the same attitudinal problem as that encountered going through security. Overall, FLL was better than we'd been led to believe and we'd use it again in preference to Miami.",1,FLL

2018-02-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,transfers within the airport are pretty dire,False,"  Fort Lauderdale Airport. I know this isn't in Orlando, but some might be lured by the lower prices to use this airport instead of flying direct to Orlando. We have just used it, and saved £1600 for a party of six, including two children, into the bargain. But was it worth it? Well yes, I suppose it was, but the transfers within the airport itself is pretty dire. There are four terminals, BA arrive in Terminal 4, the hire cars are in Terminal 1, which involves a bus ride and no means of transferring luggage other than to carry it. Luckily we were only doing it one way, on the way back, as our BA flight to FLL was cancelled and we flew direct to Orlando on the 4th February instead of the 3rd to FLL. Bear in mind we are four adults, two children aged 5 and 2, five cases, sundry handbaggage and two car seats and you can see the problem. Ten dollars for two trolleys from the car hire drop-off, up one floor, and outside to the bus. A bit of a scrum, everybody is carrying large amounts of luggage trying to get on. The bus driver did his best, no doubt illegal with the amount of cases stacked on the floors because the racks were full. So round to terminal 4, another ten dollars to get two trollies to wheel into the dparture area, a total of about one hundred yards. You can walk it apparently, but it would take about twenty minutes. Hot, dirty, tired, andand extremely annoyed, the name neither has the glitz of Hollywood and certainly none of the slickness of an International Airport. Once inside things improve a bit. Didn't use the catering so can't comment. Seemed to be staffed by agency staff who's command of English was pretty low in some cases, and the use of some screeching announcer who not only talked too fast but the pitch of her voice made her unintelligible.",-1,FLL

Horrendous lines at immigration very slow moving with no air conditioning and no water to drink. On departure long lines for shuttle buses to transfer from car rental to terminal and at gate it was chaos with crowds of people standing waiting as not enough seats while people trying to get off planes had to fight their way through the crowds and you couldn't hear any of the announcements as the PA system was too quiet.

Arrival was fairly smooth, and our luggage was at the carousel shortly after landing. On our departure date we had a four hour wait because we had to leave the ship in the morning, while our flight did not leave until mid-afternoon. Although very busy, I considered it fairly easy to get through security and to our departure gate. Our section of the terminal had a couple of fast food outlets/coffee shops, and one sit down restaurant named ""Jack Nicklaus"" where we ate lunch. Much to my surprise, our meal was quite good, and, (for an airport), reasonably priced. The one recommendation I would make to airport management is to provide some seating at the hotel shuttle pick-up point located between Terminals 3 and 4.",1,FLL
2017-10-15,0.7,Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,"I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA""
",False,"  I prefer to use Fort Lauderdale international for my trips over Miami International for a number of reasons, but primarily parking and getting in/out of the airport. I generally do not fly in/out of this airport on international trips as I'll go with an airline that has connections in one of their hubs: typically Atlanta or New York. So I cannot comment on the experience coming through customs at the international terminal. I live in South Florida and they are building a new international terminal, so perhaps the experiences will be improved after that. At peak times it can get very congested and if you're picking up a UBER ride (which has become more popular), the space allotted for them is not large, so that can be a hassle identifying your ride. Communication between you and the driver is key. The terminals I fly through are quite clean (terminals 1 and 2 primarily, and occasionally 30), the security lines can be slow at times, so I always get to the airport 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of my flight. Food selection is OK, and if you're leaving on a late flight, your options may be limited. Parking is pretty good as they have some large parking garages, but if you're parking when it's a holiday or peak travel days, you may be forced to park in one of the remote lots, that's a real hassle. Plan ahead and get there even earlier if that's the case. As for friendliness of staff at the airport, that's pretty much a premium. But despite all of this, I much prefer to fly out of FTL over MIA.",1,FLL

2017-07-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,,no bathroom facilities for 4 legged friends,False," I was a passenger on a Jetblue flight to Boston. The flight was originally scheduled to leave FLL at 4:06 p. m., arriving at Boston Logan shortly after 7:00 p.m. However, inclement weather in the NY/NJ area caused what turned out to be a four hour + delay. Although an inconvenience, I understand that these things happen. Traveling with me was my eight pound Yorkshire Terrier. She travels in a Jetblue crate, and sits under the seat in front of me. She is considered one of my carry ons, and the charge for her is $100.00 each way. What I do not understand, however, is why there is nowhere within the terminal for dogs to relieve themselves? During my delay, I was forced to take my dog outside a total of three times, and go through security a total of three times! I feel this is unacceptable, and, with more and more people flying with dogs/cats, cannot fathom why there is no bathroom facilities provided for our four legged friends. Believe that a ""hydrant"" area has recently opened in terminal one, and feel the same facilities should be provided in each of the FLL terminals.",-1,FLL

There were about 500 people in a cramped area with 2 area to get your luggage. Asking for assistance by their employees was a joke. They were extremely rude and discourteous. 2 hours to get through customs. Customs agents were rude. Everyone seems unhappy to work there. We arrived 20 mins early at 4:20 and was not finished through customs until a little after 6pm and our next flight begins boarding at 6:30.

One hour passed, another hour passed and by this time more planes had arrived with passengers crowding in for their luggage. The luggage hall was blocked solid and I found out later the carousel had broken down. The staff varied from very courteous and helpful to downright rude. To treat visitors to USA the way one of the male assistance did was nothing short of abusive. There were many elderly passengers due to join a cruise and many were struggling. Four hours after flights arrived we exited the terminal, completely stressed through not being able to join up with our travelling companions. Then outside to get our shuttle was equally chaotic.

I will go to any other city, even if it means driving hours out of my way to avoid flying in or out of this airport. They have all their counter employees going out and helping in the loading departments and because of it they leave before the designated time and then lie right to the face of customers saying, ""No we were here until far after it was time for you to be here"". The security guards screamed at my entire family (we had children with us!) telling us we should have been there sooner, you were late."" They have done this to every professional friend we have.

There were ample seating space, plug points to charge your phones, and also an enclosed section with desks and chairs to do any work on your computer. Large glass windows afforded views of the runways and let sunlight stream in. Bathrooms clean. TSA security was thorough. Check in counters are opened a couple of hours before a flight and I found the staff friendly. Car rental booths are in the baggage conveyor belt section and long term parking is just outside the terminal as are the parking lots for rental cars - minimal walking required. Very easy and fast entry and exit into/out of terminal. Driving directions to airport were clearly marked. Only a couple of shops/stores for food and drinks. A selection of Wisconsin beer was available in the restaurant but not my favorite, Leinenkugel! Overall, a very pleasant airport.",1,GRB

While all the other airports in the near area are fine DSW, MDW, O'Hare. Complete waste of time, no apologies, no alternative provided than roll the dice and come back tomorrow. Airlines used to work to get you out that day or even provide alternate airline solutions. You either rebook on an app, wait on a phone for 2+ hours, or get sent on your way at the counter.

This airport is served by so many great airlines with diverse destinations. I do think that GRR needs more international routes. At GRR, the airport is not too big so it makes efficient travel. Also, they have a good selection of shops and stores. The airport facility looks really modern and cool for being over 55 years old.

I've traveled through numerous airports small to large some under construction, others remodelled. The remodelling of GRR's interior is taking years and is painful to navigate and claim luggage there are 2 carousels for all the airlines and flights. Further, there is no room for all the passengers who have no clue where one's bags are coming. With regard to the parking shuttle - there was too little capacity.

2018-01-12,0.8,Business,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,Employees are friendly and helpful,True," I fly weekly for work, and Gerald R. Ford Int'l Airport in Grand Rapids is one of my two home-base airports. It's served by American, Delta, United, Southwest and Allegiant, and has non-stop flights to twenty-something destinations. I primarily fly American, and mostly take flights that connect through Chicago O'Hare or Dallas/Fort Worth. GRR is a larger regional airport, with two concourses of 8 gates each, but not a large airport by any means. I can park in the garage, walk in, clear security (TSA Pre-Check) and walk to my gate within 15 minutes of driving into the garage. I love that kind of convenience. Employees are friendly and helpful pretty much across the board -- at the airline counters, security and at the gates. GRR recently finished a fairly large renovation, in late 2017. They now have one central security checkpoint, and a central area with new shopping and dining, including a local brewpub, Starbucks and a Michigan-themed souvenir shop, There are also new lounge areas, children's play area and a business center, not to mention new, large restrooms. In general, GRR operates on time, which is key for me. Most delays I've experienced have come from aircraft delayed at their originating airport - mostly O'Hare. I'm basically comfortable relying on this airport for my weekly business travel needs.",1,GRR

It's a small airport, with only one runway, and one long concourse with arbitrary ""A"" and ""B"" separation. The major airlines serve GSP, but flights are limited. I mostly flew on American, which only seems to connect via Charlotte - an 80 mile flight. First - being so close to a major hub like CLT caused almost weekly delays, as my flight was often held on the tarmac by CLT air-traffic control, so we could fit into the traffic pattern. I never actually missed my connections in Charlotte, but did have several walk-jogs across the airport to reach my gate while the final groups were boarding. But, GSP itself is nicely maintained, with super-friendly staff. They offered TSA PreCheck when I flew in and out. I got to know the Avis rental-car staff by name, and they'd give me free upgrades. Best of all, if you use GSP, you have to order a tuna melt from the snack counter on the lower level, outside security.

The airline staff made a mistake with my bday so with my ticket could not go through check in after waiting in line. When rushing back from the ticket counter with the right ticket, there were only 10 min left from the final call, so I asked the queuing staff if they could help me, both of them answered with cold voice and poker face: NO! After finally getting to the front of the line by asking favors from 100+ passengers, I told the lady who did my security check that I was terribly late. She’s like: that’s why you need to get here earlier. I explained to her that airplane made a mistake and this was my second time thought the security line. She said with a big smile: looks like not only you were not able to get in the last time, you are not going to get in this time either. You are going to miss your flight. And she said in a way as if she’s super happy that this happened to me. This is beyond bad service, it felt very inhumane.

No air conditioning or decent fan system. The single huge fan was pointed directly at agent sitting on his butt, not the dozens of sweltering passengers. Possibly not enough tsa agents. Because “the dog is here,” according to agent, everyone was given precheck. We paid for that convenience, apparently for nothing.

2023-04-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,Do better!,True,"  My travel plans had me taking a Hawaiian airlines flight from Kona to Honolulu and then a Delta flight from Honolulu to Minneapolis, MN. Honolulu airport is not set up for this kind of travel - which I'm sure is not unique. There are no ways to get from Terminal 1 (Hawaiian airlines exclusively) to Terminal 2 (all other airlines) without walking - outside - for 1/2 a mile. This is done while dragging your checked luggage. Once you get to Terminal 2 you then have to make your way to your airline. Delta, to my bad luck, was another 1/2 mile away. My husband was making this trek on a knee scooter so I - somewhat healthier - was dragging 2 checked bags. In the in-flight magazine there was some mention of a Wiki Shuttle but I saw no evidence of that and believe that was only available once you passed security. All other international airports I've been in have some sort of passenger moving system - train, tram, bus, etc. Invest is something! Once at my gate I had to search for a water fountain. Do you realize how many travelers have water bottles to fill. 1 station in the F concourse is not sufficient when most travelers are boarding a 6+ hour flight. Do better!",-1,HNL

All be it there are signs of improvement being made. The security area is pathetic. Very crowded with no AC and total chaos. I described the checkin area as a giant parkade and that still holds true. Very dark, open area. The food court consists of 4 kiosks with the eating are just outside. Birds flying all over the place and eating from the tables left uncleaned.

After arrival, we had to go through a Covid screening check point which took over 2 hours. The lady at the check point held on to my ID while I had to upload my vaccine card into the Hawaii Safe Travel portal and forgot to give it back to me. Once we passed the secured area I remembered and asked the security guard if I could go back to get my ID. The guard of course didn’t speak English and while I was trying to explain I need to get my ID back from desk #1 which was like 50 feet away, I was yelled at by another security guard to go through the TSA check point again and through the Covid line only to get my ID. I said I don’t have a boarding pass and can’t get through TSA and he said “that’s your problem!” I asked if they could please send someone to get my ID and they said I should go back to delta and ask for a pass to go through TSA which took me in a circle around the airport to get to the Covid screening line. Once at desk #1, the lady who had held my ID, said she had just given it to a security guard and I have to go to their office to get it back. So I had to find where their office was which no one apparently knew where it was, only to get to a desk with two ladies sitting and while I explained my ID should’ve been brought here, they not only didn’t help but started answering phone calls with me still standing behind the desk. I had to ask multiple times for someone to please help me so I could go home and that my husband and dog have been waiting outside for me for hours. I haven’t even mentioned how rude some of the airport staff were and how clueless they were about the airport and how it works. Thai airport system is a disaster. Our experience here was a nightmare and I don’t wish it upon anyone especially after a long flight back home. This needs to get fixed! Travelers shouldn’t be treated like this when they are being charged thousands of dollars to travel and relax. Even LAX operates better and has more knowledgeable and nicer staff.",-1,HNL

People controlling the flow are either incompetent or don't care. We had to traverse the line three times while others had a straight shot in--and I'm not referring to the active duty personnel and their families.

Disorderly queues at check-in but fortunately short waiting times for service. Aged TSA infrastructure and again, weak disorderly queues. Really nothing at all interesting in the gate areas and was pleased to join my flight.

This airport is complete trash. To be fair, maybe I'm in a bad mood, but I would literally rather fly into or out of any disgusting airport in the world. At least they have beer. Its 10 pm and nothing is open. The bathroom smells like a portable toilet on the third day of a rugby tournament on a hot summer day in Georgia. It's so hot and humid in here that my knees are sweating, not the back of my knees, my kneecaps. I live in Hawaii and I'm used to not having air conditioning, but this would be much more tolerable if you could at least get a beer. Next time I leave, I'll see if I can just be a stowaway on a cargo ship. It would be about as comfortable and wouldnt cost $1000.

American Airlines closes their baggage check counter from 7:30-11:30 and apparently you have to call to get this information or it’s your fault for not having the knowledge like this is common practice.

I circled the airport for 30 minutes - about 5 times driving through departures area - following rental return signs that go nowhere! Finally had to drive wrong way through a one way street because I could see the Hertz signs far ahead. Delay caused me to be late for my boarding. Extremely dangerous situation caused simply because airport security or construction personnel couldn’t Ensure rental return signs actually get you to the rental return instead of back to the freeway.

Thankfully, the State of Hawaii appears to be finally, slowly moving to revitalize this ancient relic of air travel, but who knows how long that'll take?! I've flown in or out of Honolulu three times, each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed, and it's legitimately hard for me to even think of anything positive to say about this place (as if you couldn't tell already). To elaborate: The layout had to have designed by a third-grader (and that may even be an insult to third-graders), illogical, seemingly lackadaisical, with unnecessarily long walking with little art work and shops along the way. Oh, and poor signage, as you're approaching and leaving the airport and within the airport. The exterior just looks little better than what I imagine a bombed-out set of the show M*A*S*H would've looked like, but at least there are some neat tropical plants here and there. There is no tram, which makes it horrifyingly handicapped-inaccessible to travel between security, terminals and gates. Few airports I've ever been to seem to have more intentionally curt, unpleasant personnel than Honolulu, whether they're check-in and ticketing agents, TSA, customs and immigration, Starbucks baristas, or bartenders. Security is astonishingly slow and ""un-methodically methodical"", even having TSA Pre-Check helps, but just a little. The only perk is the people who are wearing leis, and greet you into Hawaii with smiles as the plane is disembarking.

You get out of your taxi etc see a long line which is outside, no idea if you should join it as no staff to ask. Get to the end of the line to find it’s not the right line if you have luggage. Eventually find the right machine get boarding ticket then have to go back to the original line to queue up again for sniffer dog. Then security. Nowhere to sort yourself out when you get through. When you think you are finished another security check for fruit and flowers. Need more and trained staff. Or it needs a big sign to say where to go first.

The terminal signs outside are unclear. My flight was departing from terminal 1, gate C1. The signs at the curb all showed ""Terminal 1 Gates A & B"", as if C gates are located elsewhere.

The Hawaii heat coupled with lines out the door made for a terrible experience. The lack of directional signage pointing us to the rental car return forced us to get back on the freeway and loop around the entire airport again. Of course when we asked a police officer for directions his only response was to follow the signs. But worst of all was the rude and angry TSA agent who yelled at us for no reason. We were traveling with our child and he was adamant that we were hiding something in the stroller. I quote, ""Take that carseat off! I know it comes out!"" After being told by one agent to take our shoes off, the same angry TSA agent yells at us again that we need to keep them on.

The wiki-wiki shuttle bus driver at this airport was so angry and belligerent towards the passengers after picking us up from the international arrival gate to take us to the luggage area. He picked us up from the gate on May 5, 2019 at around 9:37 am. He was so angry that he yelled at everyone in the bus as he told us to ""Move back! This is a full flight, the sooner you move back, the sooner we can do this!"" and repeatedly yelled at us with the same statement, only more belligerent and agitated at each time he repeated. He looked as if he was ready to fight the passengers at the front of the shuttle. He was so angry to a point of harassment towards us. I do not understand why he treated the visitors and returning residents to Hawaii like this? There seems to be a fake Aloha being thrown around this airport. This wiki-wiki shuttle driver needs professional training on how to talk to customers. He would not have a job without passengers that arrive and leave from this airport. Arrogant.

Upon my return to the islands I could not find a single sign in the mainland/international terminal to point me towards the inter-island terminal.

As a frequent traveller, to lots of airports, this one is pretty bad on the face of it. Disorganised would be the operative word - 4 check in staff for about 200 travellers, 3 of whom were looking after 1 set of travellers for some time. Glacial movement on the queue and when you see people being pulled out of that queue because they are about to miss their flight, then you know the check in isn't going well. Also the first airport I have been asked to step out of one queue for security (with 30 or so others) and then walk about 500m to a completely different security spot downstairs as they were unable to cope with the numbers.

My wife and I have been through this airport many times starting in the early 70's. The check in area is dark with a cement atmosphere. The mens bathroom was absolutely disgusting, very poorly maintained. There are a number of ""YES"" high end shops. Very few eating places other than a few fast food kiosks in a small food court. There are improvement slowly being made. Security check in was much better this time. We arrived early to check in with Air Canada and that process has much improved.

We asked one employee inside where the luggage check for first class (HA airlines) was located and she sent us outside to stand in a line for check-in. We had already checked in. The crowds were large. Finally we went back in through another entry door and found the first class baggage check. Now all they do is tag your bags and send you to another line for loading bags. At lest that line was short. Then on to the TSA precheck, again we had to exit the building to stand outside. The ticketing lobby was so small, that they had to have security at PreCheck to let people pass from one side to the other side. Then when the Precheck line was shorter, they would allow you to enter the building to get in line. Rest of the experience was ok. There seems to be a lack of knowledge in at least the employees we talked with, exception HA employees, to be able to guide you anywhere. We heard multiple complaints about this while waiting to figure out where we were really suppose to go. We have never experienced such a lack of organization. The automated walk ways were not functional, bathrooms had inoperable toilets and sinks, enough worked that the wait lines for women were not too bad.

At no time were we in any doubt as to what to do or where to go. At every turn we were directed by staff to the next stop. On arrival, we went through customs as quickly as we have experienced at any international airport. On leaving the airport our pre arranged shuttle was exactly where we were told it would be and we were on our way in no time. On departure to NYC we once again got through the airport quickly and easily. We had to be bused to our terminal because the airport is undergoing a large upgrade at the moment.

On departure, long and slow security lines, confusing with three feeding into two so that some people who arrived later got through earlier- unfair. Check-in at Interisland terminal, also used by Hawaiian Air for mainland and international flights, total chaos at midday. On international arrival, herded into ""wiki wiki"" shuttle bus for short trip to immigration. People with carry-ons and small children forced to stand, Immigration hall too small to handle many overnight flights from Asia which arrive close to each other, causing incredibly long lines. Unlike most airports were luggage goes around carousel making it easy to spot, airport workers remove luggage from carousel making it difficult to find.

The queues make no sense and merge into each other for boarding passes and bag drop off. There is a system and it could work well if there were instructions anywhere. You first need to weigh your check in bags and the screens are really self explanatory. You have good choices to use eticket scan, input flight confirmation no. Scan passport etc. The machine then walks you through weighing bags etc before printing off your boarding passes, bag tags and receipt for any costs. You then need to join the bag drop off queue once you work out where it ends as the queues for the bag weigh machines stem out around circular hubs and invariably merge with the single bag drop queue. Once you’ve dropped off your bag, you need to work out which security queue you need to be in. Security B is TSA and the others A, C and D are for all others. We were in C despite this being clearly labelled “international” when we were going to Mainland US. Once you get through security, options for food etc are ok. Toilets were dated but clean. There is free WiFi and sockets to charge phones etc free. Travel to the gates is far easier by foot than the further confusion of the wiki wiki bus. The airport is small enough to get to any of the gates within 10 mins Walking and they’re well signposted (although your bags are scanned again as you technically go outside albeit undercover). In summary, once you get through security it’s ok inside. Just try and do as much yourself as if you need to rely on staff, you’ll struggle.",-1,HNL

I have been to the Islands many times as we go there every year for a 2-3 month stay. This is not the norm. The washroom was disgustingly dirty. No soap, no towels an absolute disgrace. More high end shopping places than eating establishments. Open concept is nice however it does have its drawbacks. The check in area is dark and dreary reminds me of a cement car park garage. There are improvements being made. eg parking facilities. They charge 2-3 dollars for a baggage cart. Another nickel and dime travel expense.

It is older and dreary, surprising seeing that it is a tourist destination. As others have noted, indoor signage is poor. Amenities such as shopping, are limited. I had to look to find a shop to buy even a bottle of water, and then endured a long line as only on cashier was on duty. The Delta gate we were at was large with adequate seating, but while air-conditioned was still warm. And no working wifi.

Arriving there, there were no signs whatsoever indicating where the exit was, or where to find public transport. When coming back to depart, the departures location turned out to be the car rental, and there was only 1 sign indicating roughly what way to go towards departures. Arriving there, the airport officer told us there was no flight leaving to Seattle that night. Turned out there was, just from a different gate that was difficult to find as well. Once inside, there were barely any charging stations, and the 3 they have do not even have seating. Even the coffee shop only has 2, meaning only 2 people can charge their phone at a time. I’m sitting on the ground as we speak. There is no wifi either, so forget about getting any work out of the way while waiting for your delayed flight - of which they forgot to inform you.

We arrived two hours early for a weekday afternoon, inter-island flight to Maui. The scene at the ticketing and bag check was the most disorganized chaos I have ever witnessed. It was completely unclear which mess of a line to get into for bag checking, and the staff was rude and unhelpful. After asking 3 staff members for assistance and receiving only grunts in response, I finally found the correct bag check area. It was a complicated self check process that took even tech savvy people upwards of 20 minutes to properly navigate. Then we were ushered back outside into a pre-security line that didn't move for 30 minutes because they didn't have enough staff available! By this point our flight was about to board! Staff were sarcastic and unsympathetic, remarking that we'd ""better hurry and run."" I've been to third world countries that have easier and more effiecient airports than Honolulu.",-1,HNL

Arrived into Honolulu on a morning flight from SYD and had to transfer to SFO, both on Hawaiian Airlines. Was told in Sydney to go to area ""O"" to drop bags after going through immigration and customs, but when we went there was told no, this is not Hawaiian bag drop. We had to go outside the terminal to be confronted with no signage and lot of lines seemingly going nowhere. Immigration and customs had already taken an hour, we had only a 2 hour gap between flights. Eventually nearly in tears we found a lovely lady from HA who took our bags from us and told us to run to the security line which we did, then another sprint to the gate. Made it on to the flight but when we arrived that night in SFO our bags didn't make it - we were without luggage for a day and a half. In my experience with HNL airport (probably been there over 10 times) it's fine if you're coming in and staying but when you try to transfer to a different flight it's just a nightmare. Seriously, add some signage! English is my first language and I couldn't find my way around - imagine if you were coming from a non English speaking country - no chance!",-1,HNL
2017-08-13,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,,1.0,complete lack of organization,False," Departing out of Honolulu is similar to using a 3rd world country airport as far as their security is concerned. My flight was to depart at 715 AM, and I arrived at the airport at 515 AM. I used the luggage valet, which meant that they took care of the agriculture screen and checking the bags. (Well worth the tip as a side note, no time spent with checking the bags). I have TSA pre-check and flew first class for this flight. I waited in a security line labelled TSA pre-check, which was approx. 20 yards long. After 10 minute wait, a staff member came to us and told us to move to another area to wait, and assured me that there also was a TSA pre-check. Once I walked 40 yards to get to the new area, one had to enter through a door, and encountered another member of staff. She rudely said ""no separate for pre-check"". The line was long and winding, and since 20-30 showed up more after us, there was now going back to the original line. We did not want this somewhat inefficient experience to ruin our Hawaii vacation, so we patiently waited. After 20 minutes of wait, a group of 20-30 travellers showed up. Since there were so many of them, the security staff decided to open up a new line and let these folks essentially go to the front of the line! The staff said this was being done to move the lines along. What about those of us with Pre-check, who showed up 2 hours earlier, patiently waiting in line? What is maddening the most, is the complete lack of organization. No preferential treatment for people who were waiting in line, no preferential treatment for TSA pre-check, etc. The line is being managed by someone who could care less about customer service or fairness. Really leaves a bad taste upon leaving after a Hawaii vacation. Honolulu Airport authority needs to seriously look at how they run their services at peak times.",-1,HNL

I flew in on an international flight and was told I had to get my bag, recheck it, and then go through security again. There were signs to mainland USA, but when I got to the sign where it said to take the elevator, there was no floor number to go to. So I just had to pick a floor. When I finally found Hawaiian check-in there was just one huge queue. No one knew what they were doing, half of the check in computers were not working, and then I couldn't even get a seat number when I dropped my bag off. Then security took 45 minutes, and the line was not that long. Finally got through security and had to walk a mile to find my gate.

2023-10-06,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,has quite a problem with luggage cart rental,True," I am disappointed to say that I think Hobby, perhaps the whole Houston Airport system, has quite a problem with luggage cart rental. I was traveling on Monday 10/02/2023 evening with my daughter and grandson, from Denver to Houston. While on vacation my daughter injured herself and was wheelchair bound. When we arrived at Houston Hobby baggage claim where I needed to rent a cart to retrieve luggage and get her to the handicapped pick-up place while getting my 4 year old grandson to move along with us easily. I swiped my credit card and was unable to get the cart loose so I swiped again and got the cart. and was charged twice. I am now trying to get a refund on the second $7.00 charge and am unable to get through on the e-mail address they provide. Then I tried making a complaint. As I did so I marked complaint on the format they provided to contact them. It kept deleting my phone number so their system would not accept the complaint. I decided to check compliment where it promptly took my request for a refund. What has happened to the Houston Airport system? It should not be difficult to contact the right person for a mistake.",-1,HOU

Seems like I always have 2-3 + hours to wait either way I am going. So, I am always looking for a relaxing place to sit. I have noticed on this trip that some of my favorite places to eat are no longer here. What a pity. The sit down food available at the present time is extremely poor, over priced & there is always a wait to be seated even seating for one. If you choose the fast food options, there are long lines & then no place to sit to eat. Why must the city of Houston rip travelers off by charging outrageous prices for food that is barely a step above fast food. Also, more of variety of food offered would be nice.",-1,HOU

Not to thrilled with the airlines, you're pretty much stuck with Southwest. Was looking forward to eating at Pappasitos but guess the city kicked them out. And the day of my departure most of the restaurants were closed. Not fun because I arrived 3 hours early. Even though I can expense my dinner I decided to just wait till I get to my destination.

It has clearly been renovated in the relatively recent past, and that is seen in how spacious the security area now is, and how modern the architecture now is. Check-in was quite easy and hassle-free. Security is quite time-consuming, tedious trudge if you don't have TSA Pre-Check, but if you do have Pre-Check, you're pretty much golden! There are several pretty nice stores and restaurants post-security, nothing fancy, nothing even particularly Texan, but satisfactory. However, I can't bring myself to particularly like this airport. Unless the much nastier-in-almost-every-way Bush airport across town, which has friendly personnel, the people that work at Hobby seem to have taken on a mission to be snarky and ""power-trippy"" toward passengers. From shuttle bus drivers to ticketing agents, from TSA personnel to store clerks, and from restaurant employees to gate agents, hardly anybody at Hobby seems to appreciate the fact that they actually work at a fairly beautiful, modern airport. If Bush employees can have a positive attitude, so, too, should Hobby employees, but maybe that's asking for too much! Furthermore, this airport does have some of the worst signage I've ever seen, at least approaching the airport and within the terminal pre-security; the quality of the signage is great, but the directions can be confusing. Also, the economy parking lot fills up easily and often, forcing unfortunate drivers to park in the parking garage adjacent to the terminal, which costs something like $24 USD daily. All in all, this airport has a lot of the aesthetic measures on point, but the management there seem to fail to remember that airports always serve as introductions to cities and regions. Are snarky and ""power-trippy"" personnel who they really want to represent Houston and Texas? I really want to like this airport, but I just can't! What a shame.",-1,HOU

Then an angry employee will yell at everyone “there are two lines”! So people move over, other customers get upset because there was no indication that there are two lines and they get cut in front of. Then, once you are in line to get searched, the employees yell something sarcastic or mean about changing lines, “don’t look at me funny, I only work here.” Then you will end up changing lines again for the actual security check. All the while, the employees treat you with anger, like it’s the customers fault that it is so unorganized. If the lines were more odvious, like all of the other airports in the US, the customers and employees would be much happier.",-1,HOU

This is the worst airport I have ever been to in my life. The lack of post-security amenties makes it even worse. It is bland and there is almost nowhere to sit in the ""gate"". It is convenient to land into, but it is a nightmare to fly out of. You are better off going to JFK or LGA.",-1,HPN
2019-03-22,0.1,Business,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,Worst TSA experience,False," Worst TSA experience ever! I am a corporate pilot flying for a fractional ownership program, with Known Crew Member (KCM) status. I airline weekly, sometimes multiple times a week to commute to wherever one of my company’s airplanes happens to be. Even before my company had KCM, as I would go through TSA at dozens of airports (big, small medium) I would just show them my flight crew badge, place my bags “between the bowels” not take my electronics out, and walk through the metal detectors instead of having my body bombarded by radiation through the X-ray machine. Also, I’ve never had to throw out water which is huge, when you’re flying somewhere to pick up a plane to fly late into the night. (As I happen you only be doing today). Today while airlining from HPN to ATL to pick up a plane, TSA Made me go through security twice (shoes off and electronics out) shot me through with radiation (twice) and dump out my 3 bottles of water, patted me down twice, and swabbed my hands and tested it! What should have been 10 minute process turned into a 30-40 minute process! This is insane! This never happens at other airports, big or small, KCM or not. This is totally unprofessional, and someone in management needs to retrain their agents. Treatment like this can easily cause a pilot to miss their flight, creating major problems for flight companies.",-1,HPN
2019-01-22,0.6,Couple Leisure,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,Most staff were okay,False," Most of the staff were okay. One lady in particular was very pleasant but there was a gentleman at the checkout desk who was unecessarily rude and unprofessional. When I handed him something he practically grabbed it out of my hand. Then, when I thought I was done with him my sister and I are waiting to board the plane. I was tired so I didn’t notice that he was putting suitcases to the side to put under the plane. Even still, it’s not the customers duty in my opinion to be on top of those things. If I was in his position I would’ve kindly alerted the customer that I was collecting the bags. Anyway, my sister noticed so she hands him my suitcase and when she did that that’s when I realized so I handed him mine. Instead of leaving it there he makes a comment about my sister being more attentive than me. True or not, I think it’s out of line to be making those kinds of snide remarks to customers and if you’re going to have a personal conversation with customers I feel that it should at least be something nice. But, that was just the one person so I hope it’s only him.",-1,HPN

Always horrendous traffic to drop off or pick people up. The over the top threatening ways the traffic police rushes passengers and treats them like criminals is not seen anywhere else in the world and I’ve traveled aboard a lot to see family and seen it all. They need to move some of the airlines to a separate building to spread out the load of cars and people. Try to avoid this airport at all cost, it will ruin your travel experience every time.

Thursday evening flight, I arrived at 4 pm. There are meant to be four restaurants, but two of them (Wolfgang Puck and an oyster bar) were boarded up closes. Carrabas was open until they told me the bar was closed. Bracket was the only place to get a beer left, and they have exactly zero electrical plugs. On a long international flight, you need power. I ended going to Volo Vino which had a plug (horray!) but not beer or spirits, just wine. I knew Dulles was a terribly managed airport, but this experience takes the cake. There were thousands of people in the terminal and nearly zero places to sit down and eat. Don’t ever ever fly international in or out of Dulles. It’s like it’s stuck in time from 1960. The reason I rated it 1 instead of 0 or -3 is because it was clean. There are plenty of places peddling their wares of course, but that’s about it. If you do get stuck flying out, you might consider bringing along a Sherpa and some oxygen. It’s not the airport staff’s fault either, it’s management.",-1,IAD

We did arrival at what looks like United Airlines hub. We are Global Pass/TSA members so we got our face screen and after we had to pickup our luggage to place it back on the conveyor for transfer? There was no screening, no one checking why we had to do this? After we were directed to TSA check - why? We did our Global check which should include TSA? After a long wait we arrived in terminal where we had to walk fast the full length of terminal to catch our connecting flight. There was no place to sit and most of the restaurants had long waiting lines. For anyone specify for one’s arriving for the first time in USA this Capitol airport is total embarrassment! It looks old, dark and dirty. Airport management needs to invite Secretary of Transportation to visit this place as a regular passenger without any preparation for his visit.",-1,IAD

On a regular Saturday evening in early June, we experienced a half-hour traffic jam because of this decision. The problem will be even worse at peak travel times, with added chaos created by people trying to do end-runs by dropping passengers in the arrival zones. All of this creates enormous stress for passengers and the airport security and support staff. Valet parking is used by very few. In the past, it was available in the parking lot just outside the terminal, without creating any disruption to traffic. Why take almost half the available traffic lanes in an area prone to traffic jams? This was an unimaginably bad decision. Please reverse it before the traffic jams get even worse.",-1,IAD

We had to land at Washington Dulles International Airport as this was the nearest major international airport closest to my cousins residence. The arrivals experience was just pathetic! The immigration took forever to complete. Even though the lines are very long, there appeared to be only one or two guys in the immigration kiosks, which together combined made a terrible immigration experience as a passenger. After the immigration was done (finally!) and on entering the baggage claim and arrivals waiting area, I found the area to be poorly maintained and also found water leaking from a spot in the ceiling. The departure experience was a little better. But the security areas made me feel like I'm in a building that is under construction. To sum up, I don't think a major capital city like Washington DC deserves this kind of a pathetic, poorly maintained international airport.",-1,IAD

Tourists waited inline for over two hours to get through immigration. Some were elderly and many with small children. Is this how we as Americans want to welcome guest into our nations capital? My experience: Yesterday I arrived at IAD and had to go through customs. There were hundreds of people in the immigration lines (that is not an exaggeration). I was told by an employee to downloaded the MPC app on my phone and I could join the shorter line. I did as instructed and got a QR code. I thought WOW, this is great! Not!! I was in line for just shy of 2 hours. There were only two custom agents for our line and they didn’t even look at my phone or need the QR code. Just wanted to see my passport.

With approx 200 people ahead of me and 5 persons working the kiosks it took 1 hour and 28 minutes to get to the immigration. Once there, it took all of one minute to be processed, thus I do not know why it took so long. Once through, it was time to have my carryon inspected...another delay. In the bag, was a bottle of inexpensive rum that I bought at duty-free at my departing airport. It was in a sealed bag, but no receipt attached to it. I think she may have handed it to me and I simply threw it in the garbage. Well, the staff member at customs told me I could not take it. I spoke my opinion of why from that point forward I would avoid this airport and departed one bottle short. Welcome to ""Merricah""! Now, as an airport goes, Dulles is missing something. It is missing a ""T"" at the end of it's name. This place reminded me of something out of the movie Airplane. A place stuck in time. I had a 6 hour layover and that was the most boring layover I have experienced. Simply nothing to do. Typical of many airports, I grossly overpaid for a sub-par meal, but I was ready for that. The $15usd draft beer made me feel like I was at a Leafs game. The positives? My fight left on time so I did not have to stay any longer in Dullest Airport.",-1,IAD

Then at approximately 6 o’clock all of the agents left and went on break except for one or maybe two with 1000 people in line. This is not acceptable. We had many families with small children which had to wait in the line for two hours waiting for the one or two agents that were still there to get through all of these people. This is totally unacceptable if the agents had just stayed at their posts for another 30 minutes the room probably would’ve been cleared but instead we all had to stand staring at each other for two hours.,-1,IAD

As a foreigner in the UK, I was through immigration in less than 10 minutes, as I was able to utilize their automated kiosk, it did a facial scan to match my my face to my passport, then I went straight to my luggage, as I didn’t need to speak with an agent if I had nothing to declare. The entire time, every encounter with an employee at Heathrow was pleasant. I come back to my own country, and I’m treated like a criminal - get herded like cattle to wait in a long line because they only have four agents working, every agent has that arrogant facial expression and body language, and then I get yelled at by the agent because I declared items that I had bought on the electronic form prior to landing. “You didn’t need to do this.” They use facial recognition as well, but a human has to review it - why? Heathrow is much busier, and they’ve automated the entire process. If the CBP agents think they’re doing us a favor by doing their damned jobs, then automate the process and send them down to the southern border where they’re needed.",-1,IAD
2021-05-19,0.8,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,My gripe is about CBP agents,True," No gripes about Dulles Airport IAD per se - it is clean, well-lit, w/ good signage, the lounge space is a bit tight, but it works out - the shops and food purveyors are limping due to covid, so that is why they get marked down - this is no reflection on the airport, staff, or concessions. My gripe is about CBP agents. In a word they are arrogant. This is a bad reflection on our entire country for international arrivals. Personally, I used to go thru' IAD at least once a month, often more. Now only occasionally due to covid, and I can report that the CBP agents have had a chip on their shoulder for a long time - once I get pulled aside and sequestered for a random check (they found nothing), and the guy was offensively arrogant and rude. Two days ago I landed after 24+ hours flying and the CBP agent that took my GOES slip was just obnoxious. I am still angry that I was treated that way. His entire demeanor and his body language were overbearing and rude and arrogant. I don't know what it would take for the agents to offer a simple ""good day, welcome to the USA"" or similar pleasant greeting. How about a smile? I know that are in law enforcement, but do not treat us like criminals. If you have to exert your little ""power trip"" over passengers, perhaps a good psychotherapist can help, or why not better training - or just find another line of work. Anyway, I have figured out this reflects the CBP culture at IAD. My final comment is that the arriving traveler should get a pleasant greeting and a smile instead of a gruff, antagonistic ""gimme that slip"".",1,IAD

It took me (US citizen) almost 90 minutes to clear immigration. There were at most 5 booths manned and for what felt like 20 minutes zero booths were staffed. Especially when comparing the immigration line to the efficient process of German passport control for citizens of the EU, one feels like a felon returning to a third world country: standing around waiting for the whims of uniformed personnel that stand around behind the booths chatting or staring at their monitor while not processing travellers.

It is amazing to me that in one of the busiest regions in the Nation nothing has been done at this airport to address the remarkable and ridiculous sprawl, the unreal security lines for domestic travel, the terrible, inefficient busing system, the terrible service, and the totally inadequate train system.

On average it takes me under an hour from check in to the gate, and under an hour on return from immigration to the arrivals curb outside. The TSA officers are efficient on departure, and the return of Mobile Passport is a godsend for immigration on returns. The main problems basically were the management of the mobile passport and Global Entry lines at immigration and of course the dreaded mobile lounges one has to take to immigration. But overall Dulles gets the job done.",1,IAD

Some of them just sat around chatting amongst themselves, then disappeared. Ridiculously under-staffed considering there were well over 1000 passengers in the arrivals hall, which was poorly managed, with little or no organisation. Two elderly ladies in wheelchairs had apparently just been abandoned by airport staff in the queue, with no-staff available to assist them to actually reach the immigration desks.

Insane that this problem has been going on for months (read other reviews) with no improvement. I got through in an hour because the kid managing the line made a mistake and put me through with the diplomats. Others waited for 2-3 hours. Part of the issue is the constant stream of airline personnel (pilots, attendants) being ushered to the head of the line. We'd see one crew take 20 minutes to finish, then here came another crew. As other reviewers have said, there were empty seats for more customs agents. Those agents that were there couldn't have cared less. I can't blame them. If management isn't working, why should they? I gotta find another airport for international travel.",-1,IAD

He yelled at an elderly women for not knowing what group she was to board. I spoke up and said you are being extremely rude and he yelled at me by saying he wasn’t being rude. We were the ones in the wrong. It was insane! He literally kept arguing with us! I have flown a lot in the last few years and I have never had an experience even remotely similar to that.

I was traveling in business class and the chief flight attendant asked the bus driver if this bus will be only for biz class customers. Right? He answered. Nope. We will fill it out. After waiting and waiting we finally start moving and doing half a dozen stops on an active runway (not safe at all). Once at the terminal immigration officers were fine (I went through Global Entry). And the nightmare continues at the baggage claim where we waited for 45 minutes to get our “priority” bags.

Only 3 to 6 screening agents were working on one of the busiest travel nights of the year, with at least half the booths designated for American passport/green card holders empty.

Entered arrivals hall 1552. It’s now 1712 and I’m so bored of waiting I thought I’d write this review to pass the queuing time! There are 3rd world airports in Africa which are better resourced and organized than Dulles. Get more staff recruited to cope with peak arrivals times. Get family-focused queue systems. Use more technology-based filtering systems.

First we land but need to wait 15 minutes for a gate. From the gate, walk 400 meters, to the people mover, wait for the doors to close, then trudge around the tarmac, exit the people mover, and then another 400 meters to baggage claim. It's been 40 minutes, and at any other airport the bags should be there - but this is Dulles, so wait 15 more minutes. 55 minutes in total. The only benefit of having Dulles as my home airport is I never have to change planes at it.",-1,IAD

From the disembarkation onto a dirty, crowded bus, to the guaranteed 1.5-3 hour wait to clear customs, this is a personification of what the airport will look like in hell. Every time I arrive here, I vow never to come back to Dulles. This to me is the final attempt to stomach dulles. Best they can do, is to try and emulate Heathrow or Frankfurt - and you will get many more tourists to help make America great again.",-1,IAD

After a very pleasant and comfortable flight in KLM’ World Business class the Dulles arrival procedures experience was terrible. Chaotic and uncivilized. They pack you in a cramped outdated people mover from the seventies which transports you from the plane to the terminal to the main immigration/passport control area which is totally crowded with passengers coming from international flights. I was in line for almost 2 hours, authorities walking around shouting to people giving all sorts of instructions. There must have been a couple of thousand of passengers in line. Not a nice welcome to the USA at all. Avoid this airport.",-1,IAD
2019-05-22,0.8,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,very good for domestic travellers,False,"  Washington Dulles International Airport is one of those airports that doesn't usually feel cramped at all. At this time, I was flying to Las Vegas with Frontier Airlines. Now, I live about 3 hours from this airport, and it's a very long drive, especially with morning traffic. When we arrived at the Departures Hall, I was fascinated with how large it is. Most other airports feel quite cramped in size, while this airport felt like it was big enough to move around. Now, the staff at Dulles are quite nice, however it feels like some of them don't really care either of their job or the passengers checking in/leaving the airport. (BTW, if you fly with Frontier, and you end up departing at Dulles, stay away from them. The staff at the desk are so rude, that we had to wait 35 minutes, and this was just for one passenger.) Once we got passed through security (Took only 10 minutes for the East Security Check), we then headed to the Z Concourse. (This was my first time at the Z Concourse, btw), and it was very small, but there were enough seats at each gate (Z10 was my gate). There was just one restaurant (I think) at this tiny area. Overall, this airport is very good for domestic travelers, but not for International travelers.",1,IAD

Had to wait 1 hr 35 min in line to get to passport control. Luckily the gentleman pushing my wheelchair was very patient and helpful. I had left 3 hours between arrival and my connecting flight, but we just barely made it. At security in Dulles they checked through my carry-on and shoved it back to me all unzipped with stuff falling out. A box of necessary medicine had fallen out and I didn't notice because I was in such a rush to make my next flight. I will never go through Dulles again. Flew through Chicago on the way back - much more pleasant.",-1,IAD

That includes checking in for my flight, security check, and going to concourse b on the Aerotrain. On my return I experienced the biometric checks at immigration and I was through in less than 5 minutes. Very pleased the ridiculous customs forms have finally been done away with. My luggage took about 25 minutes to come out. So after I landed it took about an hour for me to leave the airport. Pretty impressive. Now if Dulles can just get rid of the ridiculous mobile lounges.",1,IAD

It looks, feels and operates like a Airport with the future in mind. The architecture from the outside, to the new subway stop going in, to the terminal all evoke a modern, clean, sharp architecture with a view towards a future. Some sections of the Airport are still under improvement initiatives. This review is for the general overall presentation of the Airport. An Airport that knows its competing with Reagan National and BWI and it better get it right to secure its future. Well Done Dulles!",1,IAD

They've changed their whole customs processing procedures which I found to be unnecessarily complicated and tedious. The customs agents were polite and friendly, but the change from the kiosks that most airports use to this new method seems counterproductive. I think that this change will entice travellers to go via other airports if their itinerary permits it. I also think that there are no actually good restaurants in this airport. We usually have a 3 hour layover and if you want a decent meal it is hard to get - why not have a Macaroni's or a good steak house. Lastly, the airport really looks run down and it is the main airport to our capital city.",-1,IAD

2019-01-24,0.5,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,dual experiences,True," Washington Dulles is a airport with dual experiences, so this will be a two part review. If you are flying with any airline except United, you will have a great time. The terminal used for A and B gates are fantastic and feels like you are travelling through the political centre of the world. It's majestic and there is enough food and shopping to spare. Passport control is fast if you arrive at non rush hour and baggage claim is smooth (this goes for all terminals). If you are flying United from the C and D gates, don't get your hopes up to much. The gate area is old with carpets everywhere and feels like a British house in the 60's. There is some food and shopping, but not at the same level as the A and B gates. Check in at the airport is easy, but it's hard to find the airlines ticketing. If you flying anything but United: Use IAD If you are flying United: Avoid IAD",1,IAD

Previously we have come through fairly quickly by using the automated terminals but these have disappeared. Why is this? The effect is that large numbers of passengers are handled by a handful of staff. US residents get better treatment than foreigners, but not much. We came through on a quiet night so only waited an hour or so but even this is unacceptable in the 21st century.",-1,IAD

Dulles International Airport is an embarrassment to the Nation! I arrived on an A380, the largest airline in the World that carries 500+ passengers and crew members on a 14 hour flight from Dubai to Washington. Upon arrival, we had to board a bus-like car which took us to the arrival terminal. The drivers of these buses are invariably rude and the condition inside the buses are poor. That is definitely not the worst of it! Once we arrived at Customs and Immigration, to our utter dismay there was only one Passport Officer to service all these passengers. After a grueling 14-hour flight this is something you do not want to experience! After what seemed like eternity, we noticed a Supervisor pacing back and forth trying to figure out what to do! A tad too late buddy, did you not know or care to check on the flight schedule for that particular day/morning? What a pathetic situation to say the least! Finally, they opened up the Global Entry where 3 officers were on duty. After 2-hours in line for a 2-minute Passport Control check, we were glad to be out of my misery!",-1,IAD

The Air France Lounge was out of service. It would have been helpful upon check-in to have been notified of this and offer a share with a code share Lounge such as Virgin Atlantic. Very disappointing experience. Also, I tried to charge my phone at three different charging stations, and none of them worked. Ended up charging it in the bathroom.",-1,IAD

After that we ask help trying to get out of the airport and no one could just tell us a simple you going the right way, thank goodness it is very easy to get around airport. The people at the stores didn't even say hello or thank you. Anyway, the service is not good at all and I am still annoyed from the lady demanding a tip.",-1,IAD

Bad organized with a staff that seems having lost motivation for work. Customers are suffering. IAD seems to tell the same story as public transportation in the US, just neglected tragedy.

If ""facial recognition"" is going to be used - instead of machine verification - certainly ought to be more than 4 stations open.

Was there to pick up my family visitors and we spent 4.5 hours waiting! There were hundreds travellers waiting to pass immigration and they had only a handful officers on duty. Four and half hours! What kind of the third world country are we? This is embarrassing and shameful. Yes, there were a few flights that came at the same time, but this situation is predictable, and the managers failed terribly to adapt and adjust. Not an excuse. Somebody needs to be fired!",-1,IAD

The TSA security checkpoint is large and efficient and a breeze to get through. On arrival upon landing my family were through immigration, had collected our luggage, and through customs in less than an hour. This is largely due to using the Mobile Passport app which any US citizen must have while traveling abroad. But Washington-Dulles has made major improvements over the past years and it has shown. Now if only they could finally retire the mobile lounges.",1,IAD
2018-09-12,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,it is definitely one of the better ones,False,"  Their TSA Pre-Check and Global Entry lanes are always clear. I rarely have to wait 15 minutes or more to get through security and I have yet to go through passport control where there isn't a kiosk free to use for Global Entry. Terminal A and B are the best (modern and open). C and D are the worst (dark and cramped). The AeroTrain is great and only had an issue with it once while it was undergoing maintenance. If you are an international arrival it will suck (sorry!). You have to take one of the ""mobile lounges"" (a weird bus) to passport control which takes some time and is usually crammed with people. You will also have to take a mobile lounge to get to Terminal D if you don't want to walk from C. Priority Pass lounges are great, my favorite is the Turkish Airways Business Class lounge in B. It is rarely busy during the morning but can get a bit busy during international departures. Their WiFi was fast enough to stream movies. For a U.S. airport, it is definitely one of the better ones.",1,IAD

It looks like they are exclusive to United. Customs was very easy as they had plenty of global entry terminals, coming in from an international flight you have to pick up your luggage and in the same room that you are transiting through give them back for your next flight. I do have to mention that security was a little bit slow and I waited in line for TSA for almost an hour. Everyone was very friendly, courteous, and genuine which made the experience not bad.

Also; the shuttles going to the different gates do not operate correctly: doors for passengers boarding and doors for passengers leaving the shuttles should not open simultaneously, as this allows you to bypass security.

Upon arrival, I had thought it would be easy to reach an event in D.C., starting five hours after touch down of the plane, but what a disappointment. Most of it was due to breathtakingly slow and appallingly bad organised immigration and passport control procedure, which took more than two and a half hours, even though I was not selected for any specific control so was just standing in the regular queue. Even US-citizens had to queue for more than one hour on that day. Upon departure, I found it very difficult to find my check-in counter, due to a lack of information screens. Security control went smoothly. The shops and restaurants are in no way special and the buildings seem a bit out of age.",-1,IAD

As usual on departure the TSA screeners were efficient and got us through security in no time and the Aerotrain to Concourse B was excellent. Concourse B is also very nice with good eating and shopping options. The vast improvement was on the arrival side. I used the Mobile Passport App for the first time (a must for any US citizen traveling internationally) and breezed through customs and immigration in a matter of minutes. Also our luggage came out in a decent amount of time, and finally luggage was not being removed from the carousel by those pesky airline/airport staff anymore (hooray!). We were out of the airport in about 45 minutes. The only minus is that you still have to use the mobile lounge to get to the main terminal. But overall a vast improvement for Dulles.",-1,IAD
2017-12-22,0.9,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,2.0,random-pulling procedure was totally unnecessary,True," I regularly use Dulles airport for my international travel and have generally found it to be quite satisfactory - it's clean (including the rest-rooms) and accessible (if a bit distant), security and passport control are efficient, and there's a good selection of places to eat and drink. But there is one aspect of the airport that I continue to find extremely irritating, and that involves baggage reclaim. From time to time they have a person take individual suitcases off the baggage carousel, ostensibly to prevent too many bags from piling up on the carousel - trouble is, from where one is standing waiting for one's bags one often cannot see this person so one is unaware of this going on. This was the case on my return from London on 12th December of this year - I was waiting on one side of Carousel# 20 and my suitcase continued not to appear, so I started walking round the carousel and found this man randomly pulling bags off the carousel, including, as it turned out, mine - had I not started walking round the carousel I would have been quite unaware of this. There was at that time no danger of the carousel becoming overwhelmed with luggage and this random-pulling procedure was thus totally unnecessary. This has happened on other flights I have taken to Dulles and this must stop - were it not for this misguided procedure, Dulles would be as close to ideal as a US airport can be.",1,IAD

Some airlines (Turkish) hand out custom forms to be filled out prior to arrival. Customs at Dulles doesn’t want/need paper but has set up small trash can for everyone to dispose of their paper copy that now contains names, addresses and Date of Birth. This should be protected (PII) and shredded. Brought to attention of supervisor Officer, she was disinterested in the problem and stopped me from retrieving my paper customs form that she placed in open trash can. Need to establish a Secure disposal of these forms!",1,IAD
2017-10-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,"waited, waited, and waited",False,"  My husband and I landed at Dulles airport on Oct. 14 from Morocco on Royal Air Maroc business class flight AT0218 at 7.55 pm and encountered a chaotic and rude 45 minute wait to get through US customs. I've been traveling for 20 years from all over the world and have never encountered this kind of confusion and inefficiency. I was always proud of our customs dept and loved to hear ""Welcome Home"" from the polite and efficient agents. Not this time! Unlike in the past, when US Citizens were separated from everyone else (including green card holders), and received priority treatment and less wait time, we were herded through a process with green card holders and visitors who did NOT read the signs about where their line was NOR were asked to leave the lines by the kids (if any of them were 21 years old I'd be amazed) who were supposedly manning the line. These T-shirted tots were rude, unhelpful and clearly had no clue as to what they were doing. When I asked for an explanation as to why visitors were in our line they had no answer, when I asked to speak to a supervisor I had to wait 5 minutes for him and he was as young, dumb and rude as the rest of the T-shirt brigade. After snaking through this line for 20 minutes, I noticed some of the T-Shirters letting people through to the front of the line. When I asked about that I was told they had ""used the app"" so they got to go to the head of the line while everyone else who were uninformed about this app (there were no signs advertising the app) waited, waited, and waited. When I got to the agent at the desk, he was older but just as ill-informed and defensive about the mess as the T-shirt tots. Finally, got through the line/passport inspection and met up with a uniformed official (and a polite adult) who attempted to explain the situation. He acknowledged that the people with the app should not have been shown to the front as it was unfair since there was no signs saying that with the app you could jump the line, and then he explained that for just $100 a year (each) we could avoid all the mess altogether. Wow! We're now supposed to pay a couple hundred dollars (even after paying US taxes) for the privilege of not waiting in lines with these desk agents. A beacon of Democracy or an example of American exceptionalism your name is not Dulles airport!",-1,IAD
2017-06-13,0.7,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,things have much improved,False," Washington Dulles has a long history of problems owing mainly to ongoing construction and an ill-conceived layout that is hostage to the airport's status as an architectural icon. Things have much improved. Flying domestic first class on United gives us privileges not available to all, but even economy check-in was efficient and free of lines at the time we checked-in (admittedly, not at rush hour). TSA Pre-check is efficient, especially for members of Clear; all Washington-area airports have Clear available. Trains to the concourses are frequent and efficient. One serious drawback is the long slog from the Concourse C AeroTrain station and the actual terminal because the train station is where the anticipated permanent concourse will be - some day. There is no train service to Concourse D, leaving passengers to go by the original mobile lounge system the operates reasonably well. Concourse C/D is a ""temporary"" concourse constructed in the 1980s and not really suitable for the large passenger volume it must handle. Nevertheless, passenger amenities have improved considerably of late, with the addition of several higher-quality full-service restaurants. Passenger amenities in Concourse A/B are much better. Boarding at C/D is cramped, although well-organized by United. As far as field operations are concerned, Dulles is among the country's better airports, with a runway structure and field size that seldom leads to delays. Walking distances on the concourses can be quite long.",1,IAD
2017-05-01,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,close to 10 pm almost everything was closed,False," Well I arrived to Washington Dulles airport at 8:45pm April 30th and I was hungry and I need it a place to charge my phone. I was walking in Gate A and B. Gate B had a lot of stores and restaurants but I noticed that most restaurants and stores are about to close. I rushed to get some food at Wendy's and charged my phone. after 30 minutes they kicked me out. Anyway close to 10 pm almost everything was closed. My next flight at 6:30 am. So I finish my sandwich and charged my phone and found place that will be comfortable. This airport at night is basically nothing. Pros - not a lot pf people, free and good WiFi, clean, staff are friendly and a lot of places to charge your phone. Cons - not a lot of food choices (compared JFK, LA, Miami, Atlanta airports) and is very dead at night. Nothing to do. No shopping, no bars.",-1,IAD

2016-08-17,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,"not great, but not bad either",False,"  As some other commenters have noted, Dulles was designed for a different model of operations than most subsequent airports, and the efforts to integrate the design of the airport with current practices can be very awkward. Dulles is a distinctive airport in many ways, so much so that it presents significantly different experiences, based on the particular type of flight you're on, as I'll elaborate on below. For the aspects of travel that are universal regardless of type of flight (check-in, security, parking, etc.), it's decent overall. The new(-ish) train is a big improvement on the old ""mobile lounges"" (which are still used to concourse D, though), I've had mostly pleasant and efficient experiences with check-in, and have even been pleasantly surprised by the speed at security on some occasions. For getting to the airport via car, you definitely need to be aware of traffic and plan travel times accordingly - I've had many painless experiences, but if it's around rush hour, beltway traffic can be ghastly (though the Dulles Access Road itself is usually fine). For domestic flights, Dulles has the best selection of non-stop long-haul flights of the 3 DC-area airports, and it's generally an acceptable experience, concourse A/B is a lot nicer than C/D, though. For myself, if it's a choice between a non-stop from Dulles or a flight with a connection from another airport, I'll take the non-stop from Dulles; if the choice of flight is otherwise equivalent, though, both BWI and DCA are more pleasant options. For departing international flights, the experience is essentially like that for domestic flights - not great, but not bad either. For arriving international flights with Dulles as the final destination, it's below average. The mobile lounges to get to immigration & customs are always inconvenient and almost invariably crowded. I've had both good and bad experiences with the speed of immigration and customs, but the wait for luggage is usually short (if immigration is slow, there might be no wait at all). Since Dulles has the vast majority of international flights of the DC-area airports, if DC is one's point of origin/destination, there usually isn't a choice about which airport to arrive at. For arriving international flights when DC is NOT the final destination, avoid Dulles at (almost) any cost. The slowness and inconvenience of the mobile lounges, unpredictable time for immigration/customs, and the possible need to then take another train/bus to get to the concourse for your connecting flight must be incredibly stressful. To summarize: Dulles is acceptable for domestic flights and international departures, below-average for international arrivals with Dulles as final destination, and to be avoided if at all possible for international arrivals with subsequent connections.",1,IAD

No it's not your job to shout, intimidate and scare people. Its your job to remain calm, professional and give clear instructions. Not shout at ppl which scares them that much they're unable to digest what is being said. If I wasn't so tired & in a hurry to catch my flight I would have said way more and put her in a place. Also the girl checking passports & boarding passes screamed at me that much, her supervisor had to come and tell her to calm down. She didn't tell me what she wanted me to hand over, just shoved her hand out so I gave her passports and passes. She shouted I don't need those stop confusing everything just give me the passports.

Even minor rains are treated as major disasters, causing everyone to take shelters indefinitely. From experience, the wait times for baggage to be delivered is easily 1-2 hours more than the time for baggage delivery in countries like Japan, London,UAE, Ireland, and Italy. In fact, the fastest baggage delivery I've seen was at the Mumbai airport in India - the bags arrived before we reached the baggage claim. Coming back to IAH, international flights struggle to find a docking gate at terminal E. Terminal E is best described as a shanty at this point due to repairs/renovations that hopefully will conclude during my lifetime. We were forced to sit on tarmac for hours after a long flight.

2024-03-15,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,“cannot support this corporate greed”,True, Staff at TSA and CBP even more rude than normal - I understand this is a cowboy state but you don’t have to treat people like cattle by yelling commands at them. Long line at global entry so what is the advantage of having it? At other airports I just breeze through. Prices for food have reached levels that I’m not willing to tolerate any more. More than $15 for a prepacked old Turkey sandwich at CIBO that I in addition would have to check out myself is simply unacceptable even though I could expense it. I simply cannot support this corporate greed! Toilets smell like in a 3rd world country. To use the “free” WiFi a ton of personal data is collected - no thank you!,-1,IAH
2024-02-20,0.6,Couple Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,5.0,,able to breeze through Immigration,True,"  Transited through Terminal E (International terminal). The airport is massive and the distances from domestic terminal to international terminal are vast. Terminal E has a wide spacious open concourse with all the amenities. Seating is plentiful at the Gates. Give yourself plenty of time 2h.5 hrs minimum to make connecting flights. The distances from the gates to Immigration and Customs are very long. The terminal was very crowded however with Mobile Passport Control, we were able to breeze through Immigration. The only drawback is that one has to exit the secured area and go through TSA security all over again with very long lines. From the transfer area one has to take the train to reach the domestic terminals. The free airport WiFi is very fast.",1,IAH

The screening process is excessive and very time consuming. Unsure if it is generalized, but on our screening, the TSA agent was one of the least courteous, rudest, pushiest, most impatient i have seen. Watched her shout at an elderly man at least 4-5x to empty his pockets while he was trying to do so. She showed no respect, no patience, and no courtesy. Extremely memorable and unpleasant experience.",-1,IAH

Long lines - even with advanced traveller programs (Global Entry + TSA Precheck). Just horrible - really heavy screening, questions, etc. Almost missed my 90 min connection time. Global Entry is basically useless - they take your pic like everywhere else - and then you have to go through all the passport checking, 30 questions. Then you have to walk really far to get your bag and to recheck your bag to final destination. Then you take a train to another terminal where only half the train doors opened,  then run to make a connecting flight.",-1,IAH

Upon departure staff at check-in were incompetent. Said I was overweight and had to take out 5 items and go back to the end of the check in line and wait 45 min again!

2023-08-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,,international pickup area is torture,False, The international arrival pickup area (terminal E) is a torture. Too crowded (jam packed with people on a narrow street side corridor/barrier) - outdoors with little shade - and it takes 45 minutes and an hour last year for our ride to snake around the terminals to get to you. Not nice when it is 100F outside. Or any time. They have construction going in - but it was the same a year ago and doesn't look like they are prioritizing this area. Worst i've ever experienced. It's a mad house. So chill when going thru this gauntlet. Really is bad for IAH to put people thru this.,-1,IAH

Workers are rude, slow, shout at you, and make an already hectic airport, a challenging experience. I will never travel through this airport again if I don’t have to. This is the only airport where you have a two hour layover and can barely make your next flight due to all the lines you need to go through when you’re traveling internationally. There are never enough custom lanes open. The security lines are long and make you fear that you will miss your flight.",-1,IAH

2023-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,Signage is more confusing than ever,True,"  I've used this airport close to 30 times. It used to be an okay airport but has really gone downhill. The construction around Terminal E is a complete disaster. On the positive side, staff were prompt and friendly with taking care of my wife, who needs a wheelchair to go any distance. TSA's staff, who is usually exceptionally rude at IAH, were decent this time. That's where the positives end. Signage is more confusing than ever, the tiny trains between terminals are completely inadequate. The worst part is passenger pickup. Rather than drive, we used Lyft. Getting to IAH wasn't bad. Getting picked up was a nightmare. Traffic was gridlocked as was the narrow sidewalk. No one was in charge, just airport staff randomly blowing whistles. After an hour of this nonsense and our Lyft driver unable to reach us, we slowly made our way back to the terminal and went to Terminal C to arrange pick up. A lot of other folks had the same idea but it wasn't nearly as chaotic as at the former Terminal E. It's clear no thought whatsoever has gone into compensating for construction issues. I'm afraid the situation is ripe for a serious incident, especially with summer coming up.  It's embarrassing people visiting Houston for the first time are subjected to such an incompetently run airport.",-1,IAH
2023-05-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,,3.0,,,,1.0,security staff were rude and unclear,True,"  This is the worst airport we have ever gone through. The security staff were rude and unclear in their instructions then got annoyed if you didn't do something exactly right. They shouted to put all electronics in a box outside of your bags for security which was fine. Didn't specify these weren't to be on top of each other (we have never did that in any other airport, as long as they were in the tray its been fine) the aggressive woman at security took my husbands tray off the belt and basically threw it at him almost smashing his phone in the process but didn't give clear instruction as to what she wanted him to do. Same with my things, removed our trays about 3 times with no clear instruction.  The security staff were so rude, unhelpful, unclear and shouldn't be working with the public with their attitudes.  I must say the man we had at passport control was incredibly lovely and we enjoyed a conversation about family and kids. But from beginning the experience with this man, it was ruined by security. We can't comment on seating, shopping, WiFi or food and beverages as our connecting flight was really quick.",-1,IAH

There were nicer, more polite Drill Instructors in basic training. These people are many travelers first impression of the US. Being a US citizen returning to the states I was appalled at the head em up, move em out, rawhide! approach to moving people through whatever multiple inspection required. No actual direction, very poor signage, rude demanding ""ambassadors"" of the US. Not every person travels daily through airports, think about that as areas are designed and signed. If you don't like your job---find a new one. In one of multiple herding lines I heard very kind people say I'm not from the America's, wanting some guidance or information. The responses were not helpful to anyone, unkind and sometimes down right nasty. This airport is not only may peoples first impression of the US, it is also peoples impression of Texas. Apparently Texans and their international airport don't want anyone to feel welcome. With all the herding, I have no idea about any shopping or food choices because if my flight hadn't been delayed. I would have missed it.",-1,IAH

For the majority this misery comes after a 10+ hour flight. I have never seen so many passengers on the phone shaking their head. Will this ever end? The slogan 'change is coming to IAH' sounds OK, but when will this change arrive. The damage to the reputation of IAH will last decades. This is a long and very poorly planned endeavour leading to high levels of frustration. I may change my opinion once the long awaited and promised change has come.",-1,IAH

There were tables and seats for a restaurant and 7 seats for people to use and charge computers. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! Every other airport I have ever gone to had plenty of seats at the gates. Houston, you are pathetic! You spent lots of money to make your airport beautiful then forgot to seat your customers. And there are a lot of older people who fly. You have now taken sole possession of the worst large airport I have ever been too. Congratulations! BTW, I flew United 1696 to Salt Lake City and was at Gate C-4.",-1,IAH

I started freezing once up on the escalators and went to the restaurant there. Everybody was wearing coats and scarfs because it was just cold. I went to the gate and looked around. I did not know Terminal D is also a construction zone. Dusty, cold, dirty areas at Gate 9. No isolation, no carpet, no ceiling.

2022-12-21,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,poor planning and lack of signage,False," Twice in the past 30 days we went to the airport to pick up family members arriving into Terminal A. We waited patiently in the cell phone lot until they got their bags then headed to the terminal to pick them up. Traffics to Terminal A is a nightmare and it doesn’t appear to be due to construction, its just poor planning and lack of signage to keep people in their correct lanes and moving smoothly. The first time in mid-Nov it took me at least 25 min from the time I left the cell phone lot until we got to the terminal. Today, after waiting in the long line for nearly 20-25 min when we arrived at the pick up door it is not apparent that there is more than 1 door to pick up a nor is it apparent from inside the terminal either. We were at the pickup spot waiting for our passengers who were traveling with a small child to find us. Unfortunately they were at a different door. As we tried on the phone to find each other the parking attendants who were very unprofessional and extremely rude ordered us to drive away. I was almost insistent that we weren’t going to leave since we knew my son, daughter-in-law and their toddler daughter were with all their bags looking for us somewhere and furthermore, not knowing that there was another passenger pickup door did not want to go back in the long line of traffic that I just finished wasting my time in for the past half hour. Finally one of the attendant got so indignant I thought he was either going to get physical with me or call the police on me so we elected to drive around to the other pick up door (which we did not even know existed). When we got over to the other side the parking was just as chaotic as we looked for our family. I knew I wasn’t going to leave the terminal from there until we picked them up because that would have put us going into another 20-30 minute long line of traffic. We were finally able to find each other but the entire ordeal from leaving the cellphone lot to pick up was right at an hour.",-1,IAH

Flew 4 times through IAH in the last few weeks and I have not been impressed. In addition, access to the airport is somewhat messy and we had to wait in line to get on a shuttle bus from and to car rental. Not sure why it was so busy.

Walk into the bathroom and it looks like it has never been cleaned or maybe not since the beginning of the year. Sit at the bar the prices are the worst I have seen at an airport and there is no customer service - what the heck? Hello bartender are you here? Would never come back here ever.

2022-10-05,0.3,Family Leisure,4.0,1.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,always find it confusing,False," I have traveled to and from this airport several times. I always find it confusing where to go next. I find the easiest way is to follow the other passengers. We had been asked to check our carry on luggage as the flight was very full. There was no information where the luggage would show up. Each carousel we went to did not have our flight information. So as one carousel started up, Travellers scurried over hoping their luggage would appear. We should have had the theme music from Benny Hill playing overhead. The restrooms could use a face-lift. They are not only very well used but usually gross. New toilet seats at least, and more frequently cleaning would help a great deal.",-1,IAH
2022-09-16,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,The signage is terrible,True,"  What matters is whether it’s easy to get in and out of the airport, find my gate, and whether bathrooms are clean. IAH fails across the board. The signage is terrible. If you’re parking in a garage on site, good luck finding it based on the signs and once you do find the garages, you better have a reservation otherwise you’ll be directed to a parking lot offsite. That’ll add a solid 45 minutes. Once in the airport, I hope your not in terminal E because if you are, prepare for more very confusing signage and a long walk through other terminals to get to E. The employees here are friendly and helpful, and thank goodness because you’ll be searching for one after the signage frustrates you. IAH, this is beneath you. Clean up the signs (I suggest going digital so you can update things for construction). Improve the parking. Invest in the infrastructure, not the shopping",-1,IAH
2022-08-23,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,turmoil going from one gate to another,True,"  We are Kiwis in transit through this hellish airport. Never in my life have we seen such turmoil going from one gate to another and hard to follow instructions..we were diverted to Dallas and return to Houston to find only small customs staff on . Only 6 gates open on 10 gates closed, 2 to 3 thousand people waited for around 3 hours to clear customs. Shocking...my fingerprints taken again. Stupid little train trundles around shifting people between gates, totally inadequate its a joke. Trying to find help or taxis a joke. Do not fly here and do expect Air New Zealand help at the airport, they won't be there. Departure gate D has 1 small coffee shop, that's it, people Q for gates and you can hardly get past them. Why on earth it this airport rated so well.",-1,IAH

Flew home from Istanbul to Houston on August 1, 2022 terminal E. Long lines to get through customs, only a few windows open and officers obviously did not want to be there, most were moving very slow and rude. Got to baggage and our belt broke after only a few suitcases were gotten, had to wait 30 minutes while they fixed it instead of using one of the others. Then out to mass chaos to wait to be picked up, only one officer trying to keep things moving. Took our ride over an hour to get to us. After landing we didn’t get home until 3 1/2 hours later. This is totally unacceptable for an airport that is rated so high. I told my husband we would drive to another city before using this airport again.",-1,IAH

Fantastic flight crew on United. Customs agents were upbeat and friendly even at the early hour. Those working the baggage recheck for connecting flights and security check to gates were extremely rude. I’m embarrassed that this might be someone’s first impression of our country. A woman literally yelling at people to move faster, on the top of her lungs. Over and over. Several young ladies being pushy in the security line - treating people like they were stupid. I’ve traveled quite a bit out of the country. I don’t know any other languages and I have never had anyone act like that ever. If you work in the international terminal there should be an understanding of a language barrier. And honestly just be kind and informative - not a bully. Not a good look Houston. Will avoid this connection in the future.",-1,IAH
2022-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,failure at Terminal E,True," I'm having a hard time to find words about the failure at Terminal E/Intl Arrivals. For the second time I had to go through the misery. Once I left the building there was no way turning back. Officers yelling keep going, BUT there was no way to 'go'. Carts blocking the whole walkway and people are getting angry. This will destroy the IAH reputation for years to come. After long 10 hours plus flights people have to go through the failure of planning the construction. Nobody there to clear the luggage carts, nobody handing out water in the heat and everybody involved seemed to be overwhelmed or resigned since this is going on for so long. This crisis and chaos needs manpower and some brain to get some ease. Clear carts, water, support - all non existence for weeks and month now. Why not have shuttle buses to the whatever lot to clear out and ease the failure mess. I said it and will do again: ""How can this have been so poorly been planned?"" Who is responsible for the canned reputation of IAH? It took 2 hours in the heat to get picked up and I was lucky.",-1,IAH
2022-06-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,This airport really is an embarrassment,False,"  Someone please fire the airport director. This airport really is an embarrassment. I’ve travelled the world and never seen such an amateur show. The current construction works have been so poorly thought through that passengers arriving at multiple terminals are all funnelled into one passenger pick up area. Hundreds of tired and fed up people squeezing along between temporary barriers trying to get close to the road for their pick-up, all in the Texas summer heat. Cars arriving to pick up passengers are also squeezed into 1 then 2 lanes meaning there’s constant chaos at the pick up point. The police have zero effect. They just blow their whistles and aggressively wave at cars that are already moving the way they’re waving. TSA and immigration staff are also unnecessarily rude. Today I watched an immigration officer tell a traveler “take your ugly damn hat off” - utterly unprofessional and surely not the image the USA wants to portray to the world. Avoid this airport if you possibly can.",-1,IAH
2022-06-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,An embarrassment for Houston,False,"  Construction and lane closures has made getting in and out of C terminal impossible. I waited literally 50 minutes to go about half a mile. I am not exaggerating. Totally unacceptable. An embarrassment for Houston. This is our international airport and face to the world? There is one car ramp to get to terminals CDE and once you're on it, there is no turning back or turning around or finding an alternate route. If there had been an emergency and an ambulance or fire truck had to get through, then forget about it. It's a serious public safety issue. Besides the ramp, there is another road full of cars that feeds into CDE, so you have multiple lanes of traffic funnelled into a bottleneck of two lanes: one lane is used officially to drop off and pick up DE passengers; the other lane meant for traffic to continue on to C terminal is used in reality to also drop off and pick up DE passengers. So both lanes become blocked. And there is no one there to direct people to move on from the two lanes. Bad for you if you have to drop off or pick up at DE. And super bad for you if you need to make it through that blockage so that you can actually get to C terminal. Houston Airport System, did you not think this through? You've done a horrible job planning. And you're doing a horrible job rectifying the mess of your lack of planning. Open up some lanes and hire employees to direct traffic!",-1,IAH

I walked to multiple terminals to find someone to assist me. There was no one there to assist anyone. I finally went to the United first class lounge and a kind woman assisted me, although she told me she wasn't supposed to. Not everyone flying is accustomed to using smart phones to assist them and staff are needed at the terminals. Our luggage was lost for several days, and the only people who assisted were the Lake Charles and Baton Rouge United staff. I tried calling Lafayette, and no one answered the United phone",-1,IAH
2022-04-27,0.4,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,The Airport is difficult to use,False,"  The Airport is difficult to use as the Concourses are very large with massive distances between in Concourse gates. For example gates 7-8-9 are close together and the next gates may be a football field distance away. There is an incredible amount of commercial space between gates making the distance between gates large. The Signage is poor and confusing with only arrows that point to Terminal/Concourse directions. Concourse C actually is in two buildings separated by a long distance. There should be fast people moving sidewalks all over the place. There are Airport maps but few and far between. I saw one. During my visit there was a severe weather problem so all planes were rerouted or held. Gate changes occurred frequently. I chased my plane from E to B, to C33 and o er to C9, back to B and back to C9. By then I was exhausted. I caught a handicapped ride from B to C once. The only solution I have is to cut the commercial space or put in rapid people moving sidewalks everywhere. I will avoid this airport in the future.",-1,IAH

The difference is at departure! I arrived and departed on the same day so I experienced the whole process in one. Many airlines do not have assigned counters until 3 hours before a flight so if you need to contact the airline anytime before that 3-hour window, there is no option! My departure flight was scheduled for 7:33 pm and it was delayed to 8:50 pm, I was at the airport at 3 pm with a web check-in boarding pass that didn´t work and NO counter for help until 5 pm. As soon as the boarding pass issue was finally solved then Security TSA barking and having just one machine for 6 flights so the queue and the mess was horrible only to be barked at when it was the turn to pass through the machine. Trying to find something simple and affordable to eat and the cheapest option was Wendy´s where the smallest combo was $12.79 and a regular small coffee was $4.49. I can go on and on about other stuff but I just can put more energy into recalling how bad Terminal D is, how awful the TSA people are to travelers.",-1,IAH
2022-04-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,I will pay to avoid this airport in the future,False,"  The TSA agents are the rudest I have seen. They yell at the lines about stuff no one understands instead of using a speaker. I think they enjoy yelling. I travel a lot and this is the worst. They have this conveyor belt system. You are not allowed to fetch your own tray like 99% of all other airports. If you go to push the tray like you are used to, you are barked at. If you are not exactly on the line, barked at. You are not even allowed to carry your wallet through the checkpoint. DC was a smooth cakewalk compared to this. I will pay to avoid this airport in the future. Right now I am sitting sideways in a seat because it is bolted to the ground made for the size of a child. I am not even a big guy. Don't even get me started on how bad United is. They also installed some self checkout system at the bar. I am not paying for that. I really have come to dislike the USA. Mexico provides first class service compared to this.",-1,IAH

After deplaning the baggage belt in Terminal C area was packed like crazy and no way to do any social distancing. After getting in to our pick up car the chaos unfolded. It was about 7.30 pm and the bottleneck turned into gridlock. No car able to move and numerous cars honking. There was nobody and I have to say it again 'nobody' out there directing any traffic. Frustration levels heating up and honking for over 15 minutes and I mean hundreds of cars. The whole ordeal took an hour. The same or worse situation yesterday at the Terminal E (International arrivals) area. There is one left lane and it took 2 hours to get there to pick up my wife. Passengers were more than upset after mostly 10+ hours flights to go through that experience. If this happens every day the amount of ""IAH hate"" that will accumulate over the construction time will take decades to ease. How can this be so poorly be planned? To avoid the image and reputation loss during construction better planning and execution of this 'plan' would have been a not so bad idea.",-1,IAH

The TSA agents at IAH right off the bat were incredibly rude, I understand dealing with people can be difficult and they don’t have to be nice per se, but making fun of people out loud right in front of their face is pretty low. The airport itself may show off how many restaurants and shops it has but the purpose of an airport is to fly people around.

We pre-paid for baggage well in advance and had our electronic boarding passes and baggage receipt at the ready; however, the United employee at the baggage desk was adamant that we hadn’t paid and we held up the line for a solid ten minutes with her aggressively repeating herself that we hadn’t pre-paid. Finally, she calmed down and decided to help us. We are still trying to figure out what happened and why it happened. We then made our way to the TSA Clear check-in and the first agent we encountered in no way deserves an employment opportunity that involves human contact. She was atrocious at best and I am thankful she is not empowered to carry a weapon in her position - she is dangerous! I do not suffer from any type of anxiety but after our check-in experience, I feel like I have been chased - and to think, we actually paid for the experience months in advance and went through the TSA pre-check interviews and all of the requirements only to be belittled, degraded, and treated like trash. As a resident of the greater Houston area, I am ashamed at what my family just experienced as it is a reflection of not only this airport but also the area in which we live and the people who live here. There is obvious change needed in this country right now and a great place to start would be Bush Intercontinental Airport.

I'm guessing they all lead pretty miserable lives and it makes them feel better to treat everyone like dirt. Maybe you could offer them therapy or anger management. These workers are way too highly strung to be working with the public and it will end with one or more of these losers killing someone.

Out of the 40 or so Customs Lanes available only 5 were being used. Once we finally got through that, our luggage was spread out all over the baggage claim area. Once we claimed our baggage, we went through TSA where we were yelled at and threated by a woman who said things like ""pay attention"" there was no clear guidance on anything, and ""I wish one of you would lose your cool"" basically trying to pick a fight.

I asked if I needed to remove anything from my knapsack Like an iPad and was told no. On the other side my bag was flagged I was told I was supposed to have taken out my iPad. Everyone around me had done the same. Signage would have helped. They took it out, but then kept Rescanning my bag. Each time someone would take my bag and walk very very slowly to the other end of the room and put it at the back of the line . So now it was something in my bag and not the iPad. By the 4th time they decided to check my bag. But the security woman was nasty towards me for showing signs of stress. I had been there for at least 40 min. Apparently I looked at my watch - I was told to stop doing that and to Calm down. She then proceeded to aggressively lecture me. I just said that if I had been informed at the beginning about the iPad all of this could be avoided. Never ever say anything. Lesson learned.

First of all, the guy checking in our luggage moved so slowly, the longer line next to us moved twice as fast at least. I was worried our car seats might not make it on the plane because we had to run off to security. We couldn’t wait to watch him put them on the belt for checked luggage. He just sat them on the ground next to him and moved like a slug doing I don’t know what. The airport is giant and you can’t see the TSA PreCheck from the regular security check line. So I asked a lady, she pointed and said, ‘Over there.’ Ok, short and to the point. We went to find where ‘over there’ was. Found the TSA PreCheck line but it didn’t display our gate # overhead. So I asked if it was the line for TSA PreCheck to our gate because it didn’t list our gate number. She just said, ‘Do you see the TSA PreCheck sign?’ I was so shocked by the tone and response I paused for a moment and said, ‘I don’t see our gate listed.’ She said, 'You walk around'. Everyone in our party was taken aback and told her there was no need for the attitude, just a simple question. She just continued to be snippy. We rushed past in a hurry to get through. We showed up exactly two hours earlier than our 6am flight and everything took so long, we made it to our gate 10 minutes before boarding!

Unfortunately IAH airport has still not moved into understanding customer service. Firstly my global entry application was ignored with an X printed on my receipt and then my wife and what appeared to be all other passengers arriving on ESTAs also had x printed on immigration receipt. We then duly joined the queue which moved very slowly for over 1 hour 30 minutes before arriving in front of immigration lanes. Unfortunately it was now 3pm local time which resulted in at least 90% of the gates closing and our processing taking an additional 40 minutes.

I have several metal implants holding my spine together, and I told the TSA woman this. She insisted on doing her pat-down, which whatever, do your job, but she was so rude, and aggressive in her demeanour. She basically told me to shut up at least twice. Her partner was a man, and he was so embarrassed by her behaviour that he wouldn’t even look at me. It’s a very busy place, and once I went thru the full-body scanner, I didn’t hear it beep and there was no indication that I was not permitted to proceed, and it was someone else instructing me. So, I went to grab my things out of the grey box to get out of the way. She says to me, I didn’t say you could leave. Ok, I responded. Then she says, stand on that mat, and don’t move, but instead of asking as a normal person would, she’s talking to me like I’ve done something wrong. She then informs me she’s doing a pat-down, and she now has myself and two other ladies waiting for the same treatment. She then asks me if I have pain anywhere, I responded yes, I have pain in my back, she says again with needless aggression, I didn’t ask you about your back, I asked you if you have pain in the front (which was not what she said). She’s yelling this at me. She says I’m not patting down your back like I was somehow supposed to know what she meant! So, again I corrected myself, and I responded with no, I have no pain in my front. Then she does her pat-down but is going around my yoga pants waistband to my back and down my legs. Maybe the TSA could use a crash course to teach their representatives some basic anatomy as she most definitely was patting down my lower back. I also was holding my passport, you know normal behaviour to have your passport in hand in an airport, she says, put your passport down! Then she swabs my hands, she actually looked disappointed when she couldn’t find anything. Is this the way they treat visitors to their country? That was the most disgusting behaviour I’ve ever witnessed and experienced in an airport, ever! I’m all about keeping everyone safe, these safeguards are put in place to protect all of us, I agree with screening 100%. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. My disabilities are a big part of my life, and I do my best to fit in with everyone else, this woman should not have a job dealing with the public. She demonstrated quite proficiently that she has no regard for those with disabilities. Shame on you for treating people like this! You should be ashamed of yourself.

Honestly, this is a hard airport to like because it just seems stuck in 1989. But this is also a hard airport to truly dislike, as I've never had a particularly negative experience there. The biggest selling point for me is that I don't ever remember coming across rude or gruff personnel, even TSA during peak traffic hours. I'm sure a rude TSA or ticket agent exists at Bush, because it's a massive American airport after all, but I've thankfully never encountered them! They have a pretty cool display in (I believe) the American terminal which walks one through the evolution of Houston's space program history, nothing fancy or attention-calling, just factual with a few artifacts. There is a selection of decent bars and restaurants throughout, though not much in the way of anything Texas-specific that I can recall. Other than these things, the terminals are dirty. United's terminals are separated and disjointed. Security lines can be painfully slow if you don't have TSA Pre-Check or clear. The airport is honestly one of the dirtiest I've ever been to in the developed world - yes, I just reiterated the point! Seating is very crowed, and so are places to actually charge your phone, iPad, or Kindle. As I said, it looks like the airport hasn't been updated (or, in some cases, even cleaned) since 1989 - when George H.W. Bush, this airport's namesake, was actually president! Some parts of the airport have an indescribably strange smell that I can only describe as dank and damp. The WiFi connectivity is something I'd expect in a developing African country (or Australia, where it's also surprisingly bad). The shuttle bus system from and to economy parking lots is just chaotic and abnormally unsystematic - and illogical. Honestly, if the City of Houston could just improve the layout and dump a lot of money into modernization, Bush would honestly be an amazing airport! Until then, it's like an old lawnmower: just barely running on choke mode while sitting in idle. What a shame.",-1,IAH

Weather issues shut down the IAH airport shortly after arrival. No problem - completely understand. We came in on a 10.5 hour international flight and were trapped between customs and security points waiting on luggage. Very little seating. 150+ passengers. The airport personnel were not unloading luggage so we sat for over an hour. We were told not to worry about connecting flights, since the airport was shut down. Well luggage came and we heard the boarding call for our connection. We dashed to the security point. We had pre-TSA tickets but there was no pre-TSA line. TSA personnel just shrugged and told us we had to get in line. We made it through and heard our final boarding call. Our carry-ons went thru the scanner, were sitting in sight but we could not reach them. We very politely asked 2 different TSA staff just to please push our carry-ons about 3 feet where we could grab them - both shook their heads ""no"" and would not help us. So, when we could reach our stuff, we grabbed it and ran like the wind. I didn't even get my shoes on. Had to race 10 gates to get to our flight. Mind you, we are 60-something old and running through the airport is not something we need to be doing. Glad we still do some jogging or we would not have made it. We have a profoundly disabled son at home and we needed to get home to relieve our staff before the shift ended. We made it home by the skin of our teeth! We had given ourselves 5 extra hours just in case. Very stressful experience. I hope passengers from other countries don't think this is the way Americans are.",-1,IAH

The people at TSA were rude and had my sister-in-law go through a horrible screening. She has had 2 knee surgeries and told the TSA about it. They didn't care, they put this sweet lady through a humiliating screening. We understand safety, but where is common sense? After their flight was cancelled, Air New Zealand gave them accommodations for 1 night. They had to reclaim their baggage. That took until 1 am because a belt on the baggage claim was broken. They had an extra 48 hours in Houston at their expense. Sunday arrives and they finally believe that they will be able to board the plane for a 13 hour trip to return home. My sister-in-law was very nervous because of the previous experience with TSA. Again she explained that she had metal in her knees due to surgeries. The TSA agents were again rude and disrespectful.

2019-05-03,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,,arrival is amongst the worst ever,False," My arrival experience was very similar to that described by the previous reviewer. It was utterly shambolic and I have spent much time over the years arriving into US airports. This particular arrival is up there amongst one of the worst ever. The passport machines rejected over 90% of all applicants and help (though not needed by myself) was not readily forthcoming at all to other passengers; when another passenger asked for assistance she was told, ""no, not my problem. You should read it properly"" by a staff member. I was in another lengthy line for just over an hour after receiving a cross on the paper from the passport machine. Out of the many desks available for use only two were open that particular evening and there were no other officers around. What never helped matters either was having the airport greeters walk up and down the line with various accoutrements attached to them like clipboards and radio handsets (to show how important they are no doubt) telling passengers that it is not their fault and not the fault of the officers either!. At least the immigration officer I saw was friendly particularly when he realised that I shared the same birthday as he. Departures through Terminal D back to LHR has nothing much to write home about in terms of restaurants. Would suggest that you eat elsewhere before arriving here. Not many seats around the gate area of D7 either.",-1,IAH
2019-04-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,"inconsiderate, inept system",True," George Bush Airport management need to try travelling through their airport to experience the hell we passengers have to contend with. We arrived on a surprisingly sparsely populated flight from London, a ten hour flight on which we were able to lie across three seats each - we thought we were lucky! (In retrospect, it seems other travellers have, perhaps, learned the lesson from experiencing what we were were just about to endure - and they found alternative routes). Plodding the long route to ‘Immigration’ brought us to a large hall where we were confronted with, probably, 20 modern, state-of-the-art, passport-reading, data-collection machines. It is apparent from 95% of all the passengers being directed to the snake-queue (with a cross on the machines’ print-outs) illustrate that these state-of-the-art machine were as much use as a chocolate tea pot! I estimate that there were 300 passengers in the queue (line) for immigration and only two of the immigration desks were open. 2 hours later we emerged from this inefficient, utterly farcical process, to rush on to Baggage Reclaim to retrieve our luggage for onward travel. All the carousels were stopped, little in the way of a clue which group of off-loaded bags might contain ours. 10 more minutes wasted. With just less than an hour left we rushed off to check-in our bags. Scanning the labels affixed in London we were then told that our flight to Pensacola (21:30) was ‘delayed’ until the next morning. (This is not any definition of delay with which I have been previously aware: the flight was cancelled, cynically categorise as ‘delayed’, without any regard for the inconvenience to us, United Airlines customers, or for those who were travelling to meet us.) As with others’ reviews, finding a member of staff to provide any help, reassurance or information was nigh on impossible as we passed through to this point. The staff directing us just were’t interested in our concerns at the speed of the queue/processing: indeed they said that we should complain to the immigration officer - see how we got on! We did: it’s all because of the reallocation of staff to the Mexican border, we were told. Seems to me that the technology employed to replace the immigration officers is unfit for purpose, the immigration management team are not fit for purpose. Please don’t think that this inconvenient, inconsiderate, inept system is only foisted on aliens (from outside the US) there were US citizens with us in this queue as a result of the ineffective, technologically defective equipment. In conclusion, reviews on this website of the Houston Airport’s customers seem to indicate that our flight was only 30% populated because those in the know have found another airline/hub airport to use in preference to this shambolic shower. It is fair to point out that after queuing for another 40 minutes, we spent a further 40 minutes being processed - we were provided accommodation at the local Holiday Inn and food vouchers - and a flight ticket to continue our journey the next morning. Interestingly, our onward flight was completely full - accommodating passengers who’s earlier flight had been cancelled. After this trip, we will not fly by United Airlines to George Bush Airport again. George Bush Airport management need to recognise and address these problems before they lose their rest of their passengers to others.",-1,IAH

We had 1h25 minutes for our connecting flight to Frankfurt, but after 4! security checks we had to run to make it to our flight, if we were 1 minute later we would have missed our plane. Why isn’t there a separate queue for connections? We had a digital and manual passport control, a security dog check and when we thought that was it, we had to go through the scanner again! Already twice at our departure airport. We weren’t even entering the USA, but still had to go through this? I understand that security is important these days, but this was really ridiculous.

The customs line was an hour and 45 minutes, then security was another 18 minutes and of course, after all that, we missed our plane and had to deal with totally unconcerned Spirit agents, but that's for another review. TSA agents here are surly and unhelpful if asked a question, when we were rushing to our (already departed) plane after waiting what felt like an interminable time in customs, my daughter asked an agent a question about the location of a terminal, and, I kid you not, we had to wait a few seconds so he could finish softly singing his song before he reluctantly turned his inept attention to us. The tram was so slow it felt like a children's train Cedar Point. Avoid this airport if you can.",-1,IAH
2019-04-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,did not help us whatsoever,True,"  We were on our way home to UK from Cancun via Houston . Our flight was delayed by United Airlines due to storm in Houston. Fare enough. Instead of 3.5 hours we had about 1,5 hours, landing about 2 pm local time at HIA. We had 1 hour and a half to catch our flight to London scheduled for 16:25. Going through the whole process of passport checks, security checks and customs we realized that we have very limited time and started to worry. As we approached the last hurdle the baggage check we were told to go to a certain queue obviously for other people like us catching other flights. My friend was also doing it on the next line. I noticed they searched his bottles of Tequila that we both bought in Cancun. They were properly sealed and put back in the boxes and we were assured that this is ok to travell via Houston. I went to ask what is going on and asked kindly what is going on and that we are running late for our flight. One of the girls working as security replied to me -What is it got to do with me! At that point i thought that this was appalling to get answer like this but as we had very little time to get to the gate i decided not to get involved anymore. I few minutes later to my horror i realized that i have forgotten the bag with my two bottles. Immediately returned back and asked for it. An officer has given them back to me but they started checking them one by one the slowest possible way. In the meantime they confiscated on of the bottles from my mate although they wanted to take the other one as well. While i was waiting nervously for it to happen rep of United airlines looked at the screen and said my flight was now gone and i have no chance of getting on the plane. I desperately tried to call my wife who was at the gate but could not get through. Eventually a got my bottles and looked at the screen hoping for delay but there was nothing to confirm it. I had to run to gate E5 with my 13 old son and when we got finally there, there was a huge queue and people were still getting on board. Obviously the flight was delayed but nobody advised us on that and it was not shown on the screens. I cannot believe how unhelpful and rude were some of the people from security department and United Airlines. They kept repeating we are going to miss the flight and did not help us whatsoever. It was the opposite. They were rude and sarcastic.",-1,IAH

2019-03-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,Rest areas are non existent!,False,"  
I have been to nearly 40 to 50 airports and have to say that Houston airport is the worst one I’ve been to in my life. First of all, the connecting international flight after a 15 hour flight from Australia was scheduled only 90 minutes apart. Which means we only had 90 minutes to 1) Go through customs. 2) Go through TSA screening. 3) Retrieve all of our checked in luggage and take it on a 20 minute walk across the airport and send it through the scanner. 4) Go through security Again with our carry ons. 5) And finally get to our gate which was another 20 minutes away. We had 2 little kids with us and every time we asked the security staff to let us cut the lines because we will miss our connecting flight. The answer was the same: we will make sure we get you to your gate on time. Well. Guess what happened? We missed our flight. We were stuck at this horrible airport for an additional 6 hours because appearently United Airlines closed their gates 10 minutes prior to departure even though they’re missing passengers and the security staff kept telling us to not pay any attention to the boarding time but the departure time is what we should aim for. Completely dumb and uninformed. At this point the gave us the boarding passes for our next flight which was on the other side of the airport. And we had to walk to the customer service to get those boarding passes which was at the other end of the terminal we were at. The worst thing was that the gate was changed one hour prior to boarding to a completely different terminal. We had to walk for another 25 minutes carrying our kids who at this point had not had any sleep in 30 hours and every time we asked an employee with a cart (people mover) to help take us to the gate, they kept coming up with some excuse to not take us by what seemed out of complete lazyness. I found 2 carts parked and attempted to drive one myself but it had a pad with a code on it to start it. So. Back to the walking we went. Rest areas are non existent. Terminal seating is horrible and you can’t find any family oriented restaurants in terminal C, D or E. It’s all a bunch of bars and snack shops.",-1,IAH

The terminal is clean, well lit, and modern. You start to realize why you should avoid this airport at all costs if you travel through customs. Got global entry? They didn’t staff the kiosks, back of the line. Got mobile passport? That line feeds in to the regular line overflowing with people. Once you get past the customs line do you realize you have to then wait in the three times as long TSA line. Got pre? They don’t have a preline. I gave myself a three hour connection in Houston and still missed my connecting flight. What a disaster.",-1,IAH

I have decided to stop using United because they route me through Houston. The last two years I have traveled through Houston to a destination in Mexico. Both times it has been a nightmare. Departing wasn't so bad, except that I couldn't find a functioning water fountain even though I walked up and down two concourses looking for one. When I asked I was sent to one that was out of order. It is returning from Mexico that is horrendous. Even though we have Global Entry and TSA Pre, we invariably are sent on a wild goose chase (the employees don't seem to know that TSA Pre in Houston is closed and they always sent us to a different building so we can go through TSA Pre). We end up running like mad, trying to grab a sandwich and still making it to the gate in time to board. I suspect the TSA worker at Houston are some of the unhappiest.

Despite it being the early morning shift, in which you encounter groggy and stiff personalities, I wanted to say that they were very friendly and polite. They greeted me with a smile and kept the line going smoothly. Also to note, my husband was wearing his San Francisco government badge and they let him pass through without being scanned.

This airport is entirely too big to function effectively. The gates are to far apart, so do some inquires before hand to see which gate you land at and which one you will depart. As for me, I was asked to go to gate C from gate A. Quite a journey due to my heart surgery. There was absolutely no one to help me go from gate to gate, even though they had numerous empty golf type carts. An IAH employee called 3 separate times for a pick up for me but no one ever showed up. This airport is more concerned with the shops/restaurants than with passenger safety. I am a true Texan at heart but this airport needs functionality instead of being a big broken Texas mess. I will not be traveling through this airport ever again.

I had a flight that departed IAH at 5.15am on Saturday morning. I arrived at the airport early, as I always do, just in case something unexpected happens. I guess I should've given myself four hours because the line to get into security was around 200 people deep with only one TSA agent verifying tickets and identifications. I waited in that line forever. Then, my flight was scheduled to leave in 10 minutes. I knew I wasn't going to make it because there wasn't enough staff to accommodate the growing number of passengers entering the security line. There was another TSA agent, but he was just sitting there helping the small line of TSA-Pre Check. When there wasn't anyone in the Pre-Check line, he just sat there in his chair and didn't even bother helping the growing line. Once I got up to the TSA agent, she met me with anger. She was rude and didn't even communicate to me with words! She just motioned me to move to the side without any explanation. I had to wait another 10 minutes, and by that time, my flight had already left the gate. I am very dissatisfied with my experience. Why was there only one TSA agent? I'd probably be rude to customers too if I was the only one working that terminal with a line of 200 people and growing. If you're going to the airport, just remember to be there maybe about six hours before your flight, because you never know how short staffed they will be on any given day.",-1,IAH

I witnessed three individuals wait in excess of 15 minutes for an opt out search due to no communication. Bags that were pulled required a 25 minute wait until a team member could perform a search due to an absence of “appropriate” staff. A request to expedite the process (I nearly missed my flight) was met with aggression as opposed to an explanation.

I was returning from a vacation in Mexico with my teenage daughters and almost missed my flight due to the slowest TSA operation I have ever encountered. Customs was efficient and a simple process but not security to get on my connecting flight to VA. I figured it being spring break would add to congestion but when other passengers are panicked about missing flights because lines aren’t moving then it is truly Houston we have a problem. My sister traveled on a different fight and missed her connection due to the hold up. Agents were predictably rude, unhelpful, and uncommunicative. I actually had an agent push her finger into my stomach and asked why I still had a belt on and told me to lift my shirt up high. Guess what, no belt, just a muffin top. The airport looks nice as we raced around trying to get to our gate-would have enjoyed being able to eat at one of the restaurants.",-1,IAH

I had 1.5 hours between flights and thought this would be enough, but no. There appeared to be only 3 desks open and 2 large aircraft landed at the same time, so the queues were very long and no staff around to speak to. When I finally arrived at the kiosk, the lady asked me why I didn't tell someone that I had a flight to catch! IAH need to employ more people! It is a ridiculous system in the US where you actually have to collect your bag then check it in AGAIN for onward travel. This is the only country where you have to do this. Every other country you can check your bag all the way through to your final destination.

This was the terminal of the future. The design was very modern and clean. Blue LED mood lighting filled up the whole terminal much like the one in the 787 Dreamliner. The terminal is huge with very high ceilings. The restrooms were like I was in a five-star hotel - very modern and clean and big. There was a nice selection of food and beverages to choose from. The restaurants were not your typical Mcdonalds (no McDonalds at IAH anymore though) or Subway restaurants rather they were the specialty, high-quality local restaurants that made it all the more special. There was also a decent amount of shops to choose from though I felt there too many selling the same things: souveniers, neck pillows, and magazines. What really got the kick out of my Terminal C North experience was the seating. They were not your typical airport seats rather they were leather and very cushioned armchairs and in front of you a table with charging ports and an iPad. Yes, an iPad in every seat!

Went back at the appointed time - original info was incorrect and again I'm outside the secure area - only another 6.5 hours to go. Nothing to do but wait - not paying $300 for a room.

The reviews had me very concerned about that 2 hours we had for transit from Terminal D (internationl) to B (domestic). My husband also required a wheelchair and this only added to my concerns and yet, we were very pleasantly surprised by the help and friendliness of the American staff. We received help from the airport staff who assist passengers with needs such as with the wheelchair (but you must book the wheelchair or other assistance with your airline). We did not experience the long queues at customs and they were not rude. Note. We landed and departed at off peak times - ie midday and 8pm. The airport is very modern but there is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) distance from Terminal A to Terminal D.and so you definitely need to take the upstairs Skytrain between terminals. There are some curvy corridors when navigating from arrival lounges, shops and the Skytrain but there are plenty of signs that point the way towards the Skytrain and other terminals. Note. For international to domestic transits you really need to allow 3 hours in case of queues and flight delays but it can be done within 2 hours if you are organised and only have carry on luggage and study the online airport maps to get an idea of where the Skytrain is located. Plus, the local USA airlines tend to stop passengers on to the domestic flights if is within 30 minutes of the plane leaving.",1,IAH

The staff was rude and kept moving us from line to line only to get put back in another line. There were dozens of people around me that missed their flights for the lack of help with customs. Out of all the times and places I have traveled I have never felt so frustrated. No one was helpful and they were certainly were not in a hurry. This airport has been the worst one of my life!,-1,IAH

An airport to best be avoided. If you do use it for transit, be sure to talk with the crew of the incoming flight. They may be able to help speed things up. Otherwise it seems you need to allow at least three hours transit time. There is no transit area, so you must clear immigration. There is an automated system, but it rejects most people and you go into another queue for manual processing. When I was there, there were 3 immigration counters operating. It took about two hours with no possibility of sitting, eating, or going to the toilet. Staff were uncommunicative and only sometimes apologetic. Once out of immigration you must collect your bags and find where to drop them again. It seems easier if you are travelling United or Star Alliance. It's a longish walk to the departure part of Terminal D. After leaving your bags, you must go through security to get to the departure gate. It is extremely thorough. Because I missed my connection and was coming next day the line was short. There are no signs about the rules, but they include: Remove everything from pockets, remove laptop from bag, empty water bottle, remove shoes and belt. You get scanned in a machine, wiped with explosive test, then patted down. I forgot to empty my water bottle. If I wanted to keep the bottle, the only choice was to exit and repeat the whole process. Did so as I had time and no queue. Everything was repeated including patting down. In the gate area there is good fast free wifi. Lesson: travelling from NZ to Europe, go via Asia.",-1,IAH

Travelled with carry-on only, so can't comment on baggage. Went in and out with no fuss, (TSA pre-approved). Not much in the way of shopping, but not many people about to shop.

His name is Alejandro, a wheelchair provider for people departing and arriving at the airport. I first met him on October 17, 2023 when I arrived at JAX. He was prompt, friendly, and a very nice person. Well, when I left JAX I ran into Alejandro again and he recognized me (after a week and all the people he'd met). He was so pleasant.

It took them around 30 minutes to scan 15 bags and only one was flagged out of the 15. They seem to be the only airport where the analogic machines have actually made the security checkpoint slower, which is wild considering the technology of those things. Everywhere else seems to have competent people to run them.",-1,JAX

I bought TSA pre check to expedite airport security but what I witnessed today was a nightmare. Their new TSA pre check area and process for screening is atrocious. The plastic bins don't go in the same order as the prior who pass through - the person in front of me received his second container after I had received my first and the person after me had a container come through before mine as well. It creates longer wait times and more people standing around waiting for the bins. Lots of confusion causing additional travel stress.,-1,JAX

2022-06-09,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,basic customer service has gone out the window,False,"  I was checking in my 15 yr old daughter for her flight to Chicago, to visit her father for the summer. She travels as an unaccompanied minor but we still like to walk her to her gate, sit with her while she waits and say our goodbyes before she gets on her flight. I have had minor issues with doing this with other airlines, due to security concerns/COVID/9-11 but this most recent visit, I feel I have to say something about the customer service. We get to the airport 1.5 hours before her flight. It's me, my daughter and her half sister. The ticketing agent was not pleasant from the word go. No greeting, no ""hi, how are you"", just a very bland ""how can I help you"". She asked me for ID and I said ""mine or my daughter's"" - as my 15 year old doesn't have an ID as she doesn't drive yet nor does she have a job. She got a bit of an attitude and was like ""hers"" meaning my daughter. I stated she did not have one for said reasons above. She proceeds to check my daughter in and as that is going on, I tell the ticketing agent that me and her half sister will need passes to walk her to the gate. She finishes with my daughter, then asks for my ID. I give it to her, she checks me in and gives me a gate pass and sends me on my way. I tell her I need a gate pass for her 17 year old half sister. She asks for her ID and when we told her it was in the car and we weren't sure she needed it, she was like ""of course she needs it, if she wants a gate pass, she needs to have an ID"". Me, not traveling much, didn't know the rules so I had both girls run out to the car (which was not close), get the ID and run back. My daughter was very distraught at this point and we are getting close to her departure time. I calmed her down, we go back to the ticketing agent where a man took over getting her the gate pass and we were on our way. We then get to the TSA line and it was a disaster. The line was miles long and travelers were stressing about missing flights. The line moved S-L-O-W. We had less than 30 min to get through TSA and to her gate. A lady in front of us asked a TSA employee about the line and what could be done to move it along faster and the TSA employee stated ""Lady, a lot of people are going to miss flights today"". I know airports are crazy and it was the start of summer but basic customer service has gone out the window. Almost every airport employee we encountered was rude.",1,JAX

Poorly run with no concern for passengers. Attitude of staff. For such a small terminal there should be a more efficient way to expedite passengers through and still provide the required safety needed. At least 15 passengers did not make their flight on this one airline due to the inefficiency of TSA. These passengers arrived an hour or more before flight. Totally disappointed.,-1,JAX

At Gate C8, an employee who was very supportive and accommodating to me. She was extremely busy; however, took the time to be sure I had a wheelchair waiting in Philadelphia. She also arranged to have me boarded early with someone. She offered to check my carryon bag as I was having difficulty. This woman is a credit to American Airlines.

I placed my belongings in tray at check in point than on rolling rack and attempted to walk away. He came yelling - “whose stuff if is? Who is watching your stuff? You like you staff than stay there”! He sounded and behaved literally like an abusive spouse. What is this? Boot camp? Who talks like that to people? Most people coming to airport are stressed out already, and last thing anyone needs is a stranger coming out of nowhere yelling at them when only simple redirection is needed. What about being calm and professional instead? Otherwise airport was clean and easy to use, also rest of employees we encountered were very polite.

Using JFK on connections, we were forced to leave the secure area going from T5 to T7. This required us to recheck in at airline and go through the security screening process a second time. Airline facilitated us, but security were the rudest, uncaring, belligerent staff I had ever encountered. They simply barked to get to the back of the queue, which was huge.

2024-07-23,0.5,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,specific for Delta Airline Check-in,True,"  It is specific for Delta Airline Check-in process staff at JFK airport! My flight was to Seattle on July 1, afternoon, ~4:00pm. I checked-in online before I headed to JFK Airpot and so I did not have too much time before departure time. In security check point, the officer told me that, the birth date in my ticket (My son booked the ticket for me. It is his/our fault, I know.) is not the same as that in my driver license. So he asked me to go back to the check-in point for correction. The waiting line in the check-in (Maybe most of them are for checking in baggages while I do not have.) that day is super long. If I lined up from the end, I probably I will miss the flight. So, I talked to staff around the check-in area. It was so crowded. Someone said, you go to there, pointing. Totally, I talked to 5 difference people around that area. Still no one is responsible for my issue. They were saying differently. It seems I have to line up from the end. In the end, I stick on one lady. She said, I understand your situation. I can do nothing about it. She hinted me I have to line up again. Finally, I have to cut into the line by some people's kindness to allow me to cut into the middle of the line. I am OK to line up, even it is long, if I did not check in online. I would leave more time to do that. My question is. For this kind of special situation, should Delta Airline have some specific rules to handle??? would you like the custom to miss their flight?

Why anyone would want to employ these nasty, aggressive, individuals to not only protect our border, but to be the first face of America that visitors encounter upon arrival, is beyond me. It's as though all of them did their customer service training at the DMV. Ironically, most of the immigrants they are charged with preventing from entering the U.S. could probably do their job 10 times better. Do the reputation of the U.S. and New York City a favor. Fire this surly, attitude-y, chip-on-their-shoulders crew.

Almost got crushed on the escalators because entire area was mobbed. Has to push my kids through the crowd so they didn’t get trapped and possibly injured as scores more people were pushed up the escalators behind us. There was one single staff member there to manage a crowd of hundreds, and he was nonsensical with his demands (“don’t merge!” - as if there was any semblance of lines that anyone could merge into), rude, and dictatorial. Lines weren’t moving at all; air conditioning wasn’t working; and invariably tempers began to flare in the confusion.

I flew JetBlue from Paris to JFK, and ended up getting delayed more than five hours after already having a four hour layover for my connection to Boston, as well as having had a long flight. Airport was not clean and staff were very rude. TSA confiscated a bottle of rum my dad bought in France that had already been cleared by customs. There also were limited food and shopping options. The only positive experience was spending part of the layover at the TWA hotel. I will never fly through JFK again, and I highly advise anyone flying to this airport as well.",-1,JFK

On arrival, we were escorted from the plane to the immigration hall and being first in there was somewhat taken aback by the fact that it was devoid of passengers! We were through the line snake and out to collect baggage in under five minutes from entering. Our bags were on the line within a few minutes too and we were through the whole immigration process and out to the taxis very quickly and smoothly. Our departure experience was equally smooth. We had arrived very early due to transfer arrangements from our cruise and had to hang around for a couple of hours for the check-in desks to open. The area around the desks is quite sterile and functional and only one shop, on the lower arrivals level was available. Luckily it did sell snacks, and drinks as the one food outlet down there was closed. Once open the check-in and security process was very straightforward. T7 now has scanners where there is no requirement to take items out of your bag so that was very smooth, delayed only by the usual one or two who left items in their pockets, forgot to take jackets off and so forth. T7 is not overly big so nowhere is a long way, which is great. The usual shops for Duty Free and food and drink outlets were present and done well. This is our third time using this terminal with Aer Lingus and we continue to be impressed by the service and facilities.",1,JFK

Horrible people employed to deal with customers who pay their wages. Have to say TSA at Terminal 5 O'Hare in Chicago a few years ago was much the same...don't do the job if you don't like doing the job.

I had six hours between the time I got off and to terminal 8 before my next flight, which would take me home (final destination). I had tried to go through security but the man at security rudely denied me by stating I was too early. I didn’t know there was a maximum amount of hours you could not check in. I did take the time to look this up in advance and couldn’t find anything. Six hours seemed common. Many people have layovers too short to check in to a hotel. I even looked into the sleep pods and mentioned this as a question. The peach of a worker replied “this isn’t a lodge.” Sorry, but my costly flights help pay for him to have a job. A little courtesy and kind explanation would go a long way. Then when I could finally go through security I noticed pure rudeness and power tripping. Workers snapping at people telling them to get moving through security and hurry up. It was 3:30AM. Chill. Have a coffee first. Something. So blown away.

After an eight-hour flight from the UK to the US, my daughter and I were exhausted when we went through security a second time to make our connecting flight home.

2024-03-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,2.0,,,4.0,1.0,The absolute worst TSA experience,False,"  The absolute worst TSA experience I’ve had in my life. Had a 3 hour layover from Paris and ended up having to run to re-check our baggage and catch our connecting flight because we spent over two hours in this particular layer of hell. The staff act like they’re having one long temper tantrum after another. Sure I get that they probably deal with a lot of difficult people, but the goal should be to deescalate and not escalate situations. Especially routine ones, like traveler confusion and slow lines. The lady “helping” people get their stuff onto the belt was yelling, snapping at people and barking out orders that made no sense. She was holding onto bins as if she were trying to actually make it more difficult for people. Kept barking for people to “move it along”. I have reduced mobility and I told her it’s very hard for me to move fast without my proper footwear (which they made me remove). She actually bellowed at me that she wasn’t taking to me, she was talking to the person behind me. Zero empathy, complete nastiness. You could tell she was burnt out and over it. TSA should seriously have some sort of plan to rotate out employees who hit the wall and can no longer function on any given day. The lady who ended up physically checking my bag could barely articulate in English and I’m pretty sure it was her native language, as it is mine. She confiscated some of my food and when I asked she said it was because it was a “sprayyyyyyeee”. Took me three tries to realize she was trying to say “a spread”. The whole experience was so nasty my daughter actually burst into tears. Ironically, my partner got through with his own “spraee”/spread—they only confiscated mine. Making me wonder if this is all really just theater. Either way, this experience does not need to be made so horrid. The agents are awful but it makes me wonder what kind of support (if any) they’re getting from on high. To those people I say this—like it or not, TSA are ambassadors of the cities they work in. I’ve had better experiences with TSA around the world and have returned to those cities again and again. I have absolutely zero interest in ever connecting through JFK again. Newark is no picnic but if I had to pick, I’d chose it over this layer of hell.",-1,JFK

I travel a lot for work and barring none, JFK is the worst experience. Incredibly rude staff at TSA, horrible people making aside comments and barking orders at people. They don’t have enough staff so the queues are always horrendous - we made it to the airport with plenty of time and still were the last ones almost to board because the queues were so astronomical. No air conditioning so just stuck with no seating in a hot corridor for over an hour waiting to go through security. And we didn’t even check bags! I’m disgusted.

2023-12-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,TSA staff was extremely rude,False,"  You need to train TSA agents at this location on true American hospitality and common human decency. TSA staff was extremely rude. They yelled at travelers, waived at them to move through lines with insulting hand gestures that showed impatience, abrasiveness, and disrespect. One agent dropped the buckets on the floor in front of everyone to show them she was unhappy about how the buckets were supposed to be lined up. The TSA agent verifying passports at the entrance was rude taking pictures answering questions with sarcastic and condescending comments to travelers who asked for clarification. It is not like there was a huge line or there were lot of travelers. Most of the end rows were empty. So the excuse that this is a busty airport and that TSA agents have to deal with lot of travelers will not fly in this case. I have gone through this airport many times in the past and I think the service at the international level is getting worse. Yes most travelers are immigrants and their level of English language knowledge could be limited but that is an excuse to bark at people and treat them like dirt. Not in America anyway.",-1,JFK

This guy must have felt he was on some power trip and made a point to be as rude and condescending as possible because I didn't hear his question. It didn't matter that he was talking very low, the area was busy with arriving passengers. I have never encountered anyone this unprofessional at JFK (and the bar is already low there). He even had a nerve to suggest I was talking over him. What a poor representation of TSA for arriving US Citizens.",-1,JFK
2023-10-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,Very bad experience,True,"   Horrible experience. I landed on a flight from London, heading to a connecting flight to Minneapolis. We cleared customs but signs for connecting flights departures were not apparent/user friendly. Staff guided us to an area that eventually mixed with an area where new arrivals could merge. This meant that we had to go through security/x-ray screening all over again. If they had guided through an area of the airport that was still contained within the airport we would not have had to repeat screening, as we had already been screened at our last airport. The line for screening moved extremely slowly, perhaps due to being understaffed? Several of us were concerned about missing connecting flights, I almost missed mine despite having a 2 hour layover. I had to race to the gate and made it just in time to be one of the last people on the flight. I didn't even have enough time to grab a cup of coffee or use the bathroom. Very bad experience.",-1,JFK

Not only is the staffing for immigration clearance so poor - this is the second time in 2 months I’ve waited over 2 hours but the staff did not stop the cheats from going round via US Citizen queue then walking across and cutting the line. Complaints fell on uninterested staff who shrugged their shoulders. I will try avoid this airport as much as possible.

It really leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The passenger in front of me was an older Hispanic woman - she was walking a little slowly, getting her papers and passport together, but there was nobody behind us and I could tell she was older, so I didn’t mind. The line attendant rudely said “let’s go!” To her and then immediately asked her if she was a green card or visa holder - I’m assuming because of her race? It turned out she was an American citizen (duh - we were in the US Citizen line). The attendant just kept barking commands at her and giving her no time to answer any questions. Then she starts barking at me and just being really patronizing. I’ve seen similar behavior multiple times from passport control line attendants when arriving from an international flight.",-1,JFK
2023-08-28,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,whole airport needs massive improvement,False,"  Absolutely awful experience at this airport! After an amazing 5 night stay in NYC with my family, our holiday quickly turned sour when going through security here. If the 1 hour queue wasn't bad enough, being greeting by shouting security officers made it the worst experience we've ever had in an international airport. I can't single just the one security official out, they were all aggressive, abrupt, and completely unprofessional. This must be in the training, as it was quite consistent throughout. I could add a little assistance if anyone from JFK is reading this. Instead of saying ""if I see those phones in your hands I'm pulling you to one side"" perhaps say ""could everyone please place their phones in the trays provided"". Its just a little common courtesy, and plain good manners, and you'd be surprised how far it gets you in life. The whole experience has actually put us off coming back to New York again. Which is a shame, as we really enjoyed it. I was emptying my bag of my laptop and tablet at which time the lady took it from me and put it in a tray, and told me to take my shoes off. I said my laptop is in there and she looked at me with a steely gaze and said ""I know.....take your shoes off"". Honestly it was just horrendous. Herded through like cattle and shouted at. The whole airport needs massive improvement, and lessons in basic decorum.",-1,JFK
2023-08-16,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,Simply awful and frustrating,False,"  Simply awful and frustrating. We were almost missing our connecting Flight despite around 5 hours of transit time. Running and sweating because of unbelievable queing at passport control first and then unbelievable hundred and hundred meters of queue. Laziest staff ever experienced, they don t care nothing about pax, repeating same controls several times, only very few security staff for thousands of passengers, quite rude and totally against passengers. No transit area, no connection line, no way to send bags to final destination. I will never never fly to or via JFK in the future. Shame on Airport authority and tsa and staff working there.",-1,JFK

Women standing with little babies in their hands for hours and no one giving them priority! The whole security experience is the worst I have seen in any airport in the world. What is the JFK management doing? They should be fired for humiliating JFK passengers, who are their clients.

The gentleman at the scanner told me me to pull up my pants...My pants were just fine (Im a 36 man, not a teenager) I asked him ""should I pull up my pants"". Then proceeds to say ""yeah you heard that correctly, pull up your pants bro, pull up your pants bro"", when I walked I said ""no need to be rude"" to which he said, ""step out, bye"".

2023-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,I loathe this airport,False,"  Miserable experience. Security personnel were mouthy and rude and pushed people through security so quickly that it caused a large group of people trying to get themselves and their belongings back together while security personnel kept screeching, “move down, this is a working area.” There was only one bench and one small table and no room for people to put their shoes on, belts on, re-pack electronics etc. and there were only TWO agents screening hundreds of people. The process was so slow that we missed our connecting flight and had to spend the night in the airport which was freezing cold even in July. It also irks me that people cannot speak English clearly which causes more confusion and frustration. I loathe this airport and will avoid it at all costs in the future.",-1,JFK
2023-07-18,0.1,Business,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,Really poor travelling experience,True," The TSA staff at JFK and the gate staff need a huge amount of training in customer service and process. Going through T7, a whole load of us experienced one particular TSA officer shouting instructions about what goes where in the trays and rather than do their job, which is to repeat the information, they decided to go up to people and shout at them in a tone as if the person is an idiot and then turn to the queue and say “see, they just don’t listen”, so everyone can look at you like you’re a criminal. Airports all over the world have different rules for security screening. Frequent flyers will often automatically go to the majority format, it’s not malicious and it definitely doesn’t deserve being made to be the focus of derision. The gate staff called people holding a mobile boarding pass to have their ID verified AGAIN at the gate, before the boarding process started. When asked why, rather than tell the truth, they said that’s the rules. It wasn’t the rule when flying out of JFK literally a couple of weeks ago and it still is not the rule. Mobile boarding pass holders do not require additional ID screening at the gate and this member of staff was not accurate. The process for ID verification is stated as follows: “The officer will insert each photo ID into the CAT unit where the ID is scanned and analyzed. CAT is linked electronically to the Secure Flight database, which confirms travelers' flight details, ensuring they are ticketed for travel that day.” Really poor travelling experience.",-1,JFK
2023-07-14,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,3 immigration inspectors for 500 passengers,False,"  Don't ever fly through JFK if you have to go to New York city! Standing in queue for 4 hours along with 500 other passengers at JFK Airport customs was a harrowing experience. Can you imagine just 3 immigration inspectors for 500 passengers? The last thing I wanted after a long flight and fatigued legs was to be held up at immigration for an inordinate amount of time. All I wanted to do was rest, refresh and resume. Here I was waiting in JFK security lines.",-1,JFK
2023-07-14,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,2.0,0.0,,,2.0,worst connecting flight experience,True,"  This is the worst connecting flight experience I've ever encountered. We needed to collect our bags and go through border patrol/re-check bags/security. This in itself wouldn't be a problem if the airport was sufficiently manned and the process wasn't so slow. We landed into JFK at 5.45pm, our connecting flight was at 8.05pm. When coming off the plane we followed the signs for non USA citizens and stood queuing for 45 mins for passport control. It was only when we got near the front of the queue we realised there is a 'quick connect' queue for people on connecting flights. This isn't visible or well signposted until you are at the front of the queue, there were no staff directing. You would have to walk passed the 'Non USA Citizens' queue to see it. Even once we switched to that queue (as the other had stagnated completely) it still took an additional 30 mins. There was one border officer who had to take prints and pictures of every passenger. It wasn't something that can be done quickly and I understand why, however more staff would help. Once through there our bag collection was quick and easy, so that was a positive.  From there we followed signs for connecting passengers. We re-checked the bags which was quick for us. We headed for security, there is a specific security for connecting passengers. The queue was long but not overly long, the issue was again how slow it was. They had one belt open for all connecting flights. After 30 mins of queuing here, our family and others made it known to airport staff that due to the length of time queuing we were going to miss our flight. We had 30 mins until take off, others had even less. A lady who tried to be helpful took us to the front and asked security staff if we could go through as a priority as we were going to miss our flights, unfortunately she was told no. There was a belt for 'TSA' passengers that was empty, they were unwilling to let people use it despite the lady pleading with them on our behalf. I'd like to thank her, I don't know her name but she tried to help and got a hard time from others because of it. Another worker would let parties of 2 jump to the front but not us as we were a party of 4. It was so frustrating being refused help yourself to have others jump in front, making us more likely to miss our flight. After 45 mins of some passengers pleading for priority to get through and one young woman crying her eyes out because she was missing her plane, they decided opening a second belt was a good idea. After a 1 hour queue at security, we got through with 10 mins to go. We sprinted shoeless through the airport to our gate, the airport is huge so it was quite a way. We made it just in time. The icing on the cake was when we arrived at our final destination and all 4 of our bags had been left in New York. The only saving grace was that we did make our flight, despite it being an unnecessarily stressful situation. My advice is, if possible don't connect here. If you do, make sure you have 3 hours minimum to do it in case the service is as bad as it was for us. Look for the 'Quick Connect' queue at passport control if you are on a connecting flight.",-1,JFK
2023-07-12,0.7,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,not an aesthetically pleasing airport,True,"  JFK is arguably my least favorite airport, but I was pleasantly surprised with my experience this time. The check in and security process was exceptionally quick as I was able to get to my gate in less than an hour! I was also not expecting the TSA to be so accommodating considering my own past experiences at JFK dealing with their rudeness. There were a decent amount of food options, but most were charging pretty steep prices so the McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts were a godsend. Ultimately, JFK’s biggest advantage is the range of destinations you can fly to directly, it’s not an aesthetically pleasing airport with world class amenities but at least this time was far less stressful. This was also my first time flying out of Terminal 4 so I feel the experience really varies based on the terminal.",1,JFK

2023-07-05,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,arrival experience at JFK is dreadful,False,"  Given the lengthy international flight times to NYC and the exciting prospect to a traveller of seeing one of the world's most exciting destinations, the arrival experience at JFK is a dreadful advert for the USA. The airport is old, poorly designed and needs knocked down. Passport control and security is almost third-world, crowds being shepherded in their hundreds (after a long walk) into one huge hall and processed at a snail's pace (two hours in my case after after a 13-hour flight). No respite if you are a child, or old or disabled. It is quite simply, a devastatingly unpleasant experience. The wi-fi is poor, signage is poor, the exits are small, there are not enough restrooms, the lack of amenities is endless. Departure is marginally better but not enough security machinery to process quickly. The shops are not great in quality and everyone just looks disappointed! This airport does not feel or look clean. What a shame that this (last-century) airport is the gateway to an amazing city. Next time it will be Newark!",-1,JFK
2023-07-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,3.0,0.0,,5.0,,Not a single staff member to control crowds,True," Horrendous - the only way to describe the immigration system. Last night, T8, total chaos. No way to even join a queue initially as was insanely busy. Free for all. Not a single staff member to control crowds. Took 2 hrs 40 mins to get through in cramped stifling conditions. Not fit for purpose. Unlike other airports, no e-gates. Welcome to America? Last time I came via Dublin with Aer Lingus was brilliant where you pre-clear immigration..

Everywhere in New York City it's possible to enter the subway with a credit card. Arriving at the airport you have to buy a metro card (long queues!) for an air train, that doesn't even reach every terminal. Totally embarrassing! To reach terminal 1, you have to switch to a crowded bus, that takes 8 minutes to the terminal, which is about 50 meters away. What the heck? I cannot believe this chaos! Never ever again!",-1,JFK
2023-06-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,Totally unacceptable,True," Arriving after a 14 hour flight at JFK from Seoul, the plane waited on the tarmac for 25 minutes, the immigration hall was full to overflowing and it took 70 minutes in a winding line to get through to the full luggage hall. But much worse to come! The SkyTrain at Terminal 1 is out of action and the buses to the Sky train at terminal 8 were insufficient to handle the crowd so it was another hour in a line waiting for the shuttle and then a dangerously full bus to terminal 8 and then more time waiting for the SkyTrain. More than 3 hours from touch down to arrival at the hotel bus stop. Totally unacceptable.",-1,JFK
2023-06-18,0.1,Business,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,could be unsettling or traumatising,False," As a frequent traveller, this is probably the worst airport experience of my life. On June 17th at around 08.30 PM I went through security at Terminal 7 to take my flight. The person driving the queue gave confusing indications, and when people rightfully expressed their confusion, she reacted with a snobbish attitude or by yelling at them. Once arrived to the scanners, the person supposed to instruct passengers about what to take out of their bags kept yelling at everyone, saying she was angry because people did not listen - maybe she forgets that the airport is also used by people who don´t speak the language, or by people who can´t hear, or by unexperienced travellers. This made us and the other passengers around us extremely uncomfortable, and I was personally shocked by such disturbing behaviour. I am a young and healthy traveller who will probably forget this experience in a few weeks, but for elderly passengers or first-time travellers this could be unsettling or traumatising.",-1,JFK

Why does everyone yell, why would you have such mean, anxiety inducing individuals work here.

We had a short transfer time due to a delay in our inbound flight to JFK. We had asked the airport personnel for any assistance to expedite our way to our next flight and the remark one gets back is ""that is not our problem, we don´t care."" I am now trying to always avoid this dirty unprofessional airport. Keep in mind we were traveling with a kid and it was his first time in New York and he says he never wants to return to this airport. Shame on them really.",-1,JFK

For a country that prides itself on customer service, the staff in this airport are the epitome of exceptionally bad and rude behaviour. I have never witnessed such appalling rudeness and arrogance from TSA staff. Their air of superiority is second-to-none and their blatant disrespect of passengers and their belongings is unparalled. TSA staff, in general, tend to be obnoxious but the staff in JFK are the outright winners. The TSA staff add significant stress, worry and anxiety to many passengers who are already nervous travellers which is dreadful considering the ongoing mental health crisis at the moment. These staff need to be either fired or retrained into non-customer-facing roles. Truly, truly dreadful. Failing that, the leadership and management of TSA need to spend some time with the staff on the ground to witness their unrelenting rudeness, and subsequently introduce customer service training.",-1,JFK

Our flight arrived later than planned and they had us wait in the airplane for additional time. This had us scrambling through immigration and TSA even with being allowed to rush to the front of the line due to our flight boarding. By the time we made it back to departures, our terminal, and our gate the doors had closed. Immigration had only a few people working the line causing it to move slow. Everyone was packed into one line until one of the officers started to finally ask for US citizens with US passports to form another line. TSA was not helpful at all other than a few people letting us know to rush forward. Very dirty, busy and expensive with too many employees who aren’t so helpful. International connecting flights with short layover especially if the flight is behind should have some type of marker on their tickets or a line to make things faster for them since we cannot control wait times.",-1,JFK

I was traveling with my 2 children who speak no English, and they were being sent to a different X-Ray machine than I was. They were terrified, but TSA couldn't care less. Upon the arrival at the airport, on the Monitor the boarding Gate displayed was number 10, but on the printed boarding Pass was number 7. I asked the check-in staff what was the correct gate and they confirmed me it was number 7. When I arrived at gate 7, the flight that was going to board there was for Vienna and I was flying to Lisbon. I then Proceeded to Gate 10, which was shown on the monitor, and the boarding told me that it was on gate 1. Thankfully in that same instant on gate 10 monitor showed up my flight and I stayed there in gate 10.

We then got our bags and we’re getting them checked but after waiting in the line for customs for so long they said we couldn’t get our bags checked or get on the plane because it was 50 minutes before the departure and they needed our bags 60 minutes before. We then had to wait in line for almost 2 hours to reschedule our flight because literally everyone flying on our airline was screwed over. The workers there were the most unhelpful, rude people and after pleading with them for 30 minutes we were able to book a flight over 24 hours later. Everyone else in line was also in the same boat, trying desperately to find a new flight while the workers basically did nothing.

It was an utter shambles with hundreds of people waiting to go through and collect luggage. More flights were arriving and the number of passengers waiting to be processed just got bigger. At no point was there any explanation why we were being held up (obviously due to staff shortages) staff that were there were rude and unhelpful. We were in this queue with a 15month old baby, no allowance given. One man in the queue who had arrived with his disabled wife was still made to wait whilst they fast tracked his wife who was then left stranded on the other side! It was crazy.

If you have read my first review, you know that JFK got off on a rocky start. I would say that my experience was slightly better. There was one woman in particular who cared about people. She thought I was on my own so she stopped her traffic job to ask me where the driver was. I took that as a kind act. Some staff was rudely telling people to move up, and one woman actually had the sense to YELL at a family. Are you kidding me? Thankfully, India takes connections, and we didn't have to take JFK for everything, but it was our final stop. When I went to use the bathroom, I was in shock. There was a water bottle in the urinal. The floor had some sort of water that I was unsure of. I pushed the red button on the feedback thingy. I really thank you, JFK, for ruining my experience. We are going to Punta Cana in Autumn, and we are certainly not associating with this place!",-1,JFK
2023-01-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,1.0,No communication skills whatsoever,True," Absolutely disappointed in the manner how the security check is handled. No communication skills, not polite. I had a lotion in my bag which was slightly too big according to the standards. Not a problem, BUT: The security guy was looking for this lotion by taking everything out from my bag. I said to him that I can let him know where it is if he can let me know what he looks for. I was completely ignored. When he found it, I asked him not to touch my personal belongings anymore and I would pack it back myself, he completely ignored me. He stuffed all things back and stepped away. No communication skills whatsoever. How difficult it is to be polite and communicate? On a last note: The Netherlands has already greater systems for scanning, without taking anything out of bags. Liquids are also allowed because they can check through the screens what kind of liquids it is. This makes customer service million times better.",-1,JFK

Hundreds of travellers lined up for customs with only two processing agents. Even these left periodically with travellers, leaving nobody to continue processing. 3h in line. When we finally moved through, we entered the security lineup, which kept being held up because there were only 4 agents manning scanners. Meanwhile, customers were being moved ahead as their flights were departing imminently… leaving more of us in our own danger of missing our connections. Total disrespect and disregard for the reality of their customers. Will never fly through JFK again.",-1,JFK

That’s where we went immediately. Terminal 2 is in terrible condition, with overpriced and disgusting food options. We have traveled extensively. This is our worst food experience. If it was only that, it would not warrant feedback. What really, REALLY got to us is the impromptu change of terminal for our domestic. Flight mid-afternoon, about three hours before departure. We were to move back to terminal four. Once again, we complied without delay, and we were right! 45-50 minutes wait were announced. It took us over an hour. That was so because of the unmanaged merging of two wait lanes to access security checks. Following that, the TSA employee asked to see the kids’ passports (they are both under 11), which has never happened any other place. We have passports for them. Most people do not. Finally, actually getting our belongings on the scanner was a free for all encouraged by the TSA employee. Overall, when at all possible, we will avoid JFK at all cost.",-1,JFK

The most rude, unprofessional and unhelpful TSA security people I’ve ever come across.

The noise level, neon lights and lack of quiet space or comfortable seating area create extremely stressful environment. It doesn’t help that it is populated with inexperienced holiday travelers. Perhaps, JetBlue or terminal management should give more thought to how improve the human experience rather than focus on flashy exterior l.

Common sense will let management know there will be a lot of travelers but as I landed at 5:10am and ended up leaving the line at almost 9:00am. Before I even joined the line at the customs I could overhear a airport personnel shouting at a traveler who was confused as to where the line starts that “this is not a jungle”. Which was very rude in my opinion. The line had at least 800 people in it. The WiFi didn’t work at the airport, it was 9 degrees Celsius outside but I was sweating in the line. The infrastructure looked old and duty and rusty. I was standing the whole 3 hours on just this one line no where to seat down .. they had to pull people who had connecting flight of the line because obviously they were going to miss it. There was just 3 or 4 customs officers working and at an extremely low pace to the extent when one person was finally processed by an officer the crowd gave a sarcastic clap. Simply put JFK is a nightmare and is in need for a serious upgrade especially with its personnel",-1,JFK

We have never flown into JFK and did not know the set up and how the terminals are set up. We arrived at terminal 8 with 40 mins to get to our next plane. We had to go to Terminal 5. When we got off the plane, I asked at the ticket area where Terminal 5 was and she said follow green signs to the airtrain and then 2 stops. Ok, great we thought that sounds like no problem. We followed the green signs for 25 mins and then security told us we would have to keep following signs and then go out and back in and go through security again after the airtrain! What? Really. We explained that our next plane was boarding already and they shrugged their shoulders and turned their backs. When I asked before, no one told us we would need to go thru security again. At security, we explained our plane was boarding and we had just gotten off one plane and they just shrugged and laughed and wouldn't help. After another 25 mins in security, we made it to our gate as they were closing the door. Thanks for nothing American and JetBlue!",-1,JFK
2022-11-25,0.4,Family Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,,2.0,Not a very friendly airport,False,"  Not a very friendly airport. We were flying a few weeks ago on Delta Airlines. When we got to the airport, a man needed help with his baggage tag. The woman groaned and said, “Ughhhhh!” While we were going through Security, a woman told a man rudely to move up, he asked where. The woman raised her voice and said, “Over here!” Then she loudly sighed and slapped her knee. I understand that it was 6 am at the crack of dawn but it is no excuse to take it out on customers! On our way back from our vacation, I was going to give the airport another chance when a woman rudely told the drivers at the stop to move up. Despite these rude people at the airport, there were nice people. My father asked the lady at baggage security if she could change her glove because she touched other suitcases, she kindly said, “Of course!” Well, you can thank the people that pushed me to write this 4/10 star review. We will be taking another vacation to India soon and needless to say we will be flying out of elsewhere!",-1,JFK

The JFK airport is disgusting and only manages to get worse. Some of the terminals are completely dilapidated and isolated.

I had to travel from terminal 1 to terminal 8 and was scammed by a lady wearing security airport outfit. She told me i was too late for my flight which was boarding in 55 mins. She said the train depart every 30 mins and i should have take the shuttle to terminal 8. End up the shuttle was her personal car and i wad charged $97 for cash and $108 for card. This is my first time transit at this airport and i have no idea about the departure time of the train. I cant belive that the airport allows scammers stay inside and scam travelers who are new to this airport and dont have enough information about transportation. I will definitely avoid this airport in the future.,-1,JFK
2022-10-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,"totally unprofessional, extremely disrespectful",False,"  On Monday, October 24, 2022, my husband and I arrived at JFK for our flight to Calgary. At the WestJet check-in counter we asked for a wheelchair as my husband has trouble walking long distances. The woman there was very accommodating, and they brought us a plastic type of wheelchair (JetWheel?). She wheeled my husband a short distance and said to wait for an agent to come. We waited over half an hour. It looked as though she was trying to contact someone. Finally, an older man came, walking very slowly, and looking very uninterested in pushing the wheelchair. However, the woman urged him to hurry, and he proceeded to push the wheelchair, cutting through the security line in a couple of places to get to the security check. This is where we had a very troubling experience, The young woman on security started yelling at the agent who was pushing the wheelchair, telling him to empty his pockets. He told her he didn't have anything in his pockets, She kept yelling at him, and went on about how this happens every time. Then she started yelling at my husband to empty his pockets, to take the kleenex out of his pocket, etc. Other people were also going through security, and she's yelling at us, and there are no bins to put our things in, and our possessions are being thrown on the conveyer, some on the conveyer, some in different bins, some on the floor. It was total bedlam. This woman should not be working there. She was totally unprofessional, extremely disrespectful, and it was totally uncalled for. When we finally got through this area, the agent started pushing the wheelchair. I was very angry and upset by this time, and asked him to stop. I had no idea if we had collected everything, and I needed to assess what was what. It turned out that we did not have my husband's iPhone. Another security person, a man, started looking, and came up with an object. It wasn't our phone but a medical device that we needed. I said that we still did not have our phone. Finally, he finds it. Still not sure if we got everything. It was like a nightmare. I suspect that they may have a purpose to their bedlam. I wonder how many phones, etc. they end up with, after terrorizing the passengers going through. The agent then took us to a gate, and was ready to leave us when luckily I decided to verify that it was the correct gate. It wasn't. He said he was very sorry, and I do think it was an honest mistake. He then took us to the correct gate which was a long ways away. We would not have been able to walk it. The agent that pushed the wheelchair said that the woman at security was ""mean"" and was always like that, and was always attacking him. Is there no supervision at this major American airport? I noticed similar stories in many of the reviews. This was a very disturbing experience for my husband and I - both seniors. One would think there would be some kind of accountability.",-1,JFK

I’d gladly trek to Jersey than go to JFK. The TSA employees are completely incompetent. There was a male TSA employee who told all the female passengers to stand on one side just because their female TSA employee wasn’t available for pat-down. Like as if most passengers need a pat-down? And even when she was available, he still asked us to wait on one side and let all the male passengers go through security. Also, only 3 food choices at Terminal 7.

Have to go to TSA check again for a connecting international flight. Prepare yourself to wait in line for at least 1h. This is so unnecessary. If you bough any liquid (alcohol bottle, oil, etc) at the duty free of the previous airport, it will be confiscated by TSA. They yell at my 10 years old son for not being fast enough to put his bag into the bin. A TSA guy rudely told a lady in front of me who was not understanding what he was asking to her: ""are you really deciding to mot listen to me today!"". Avoid this place at all cost.

If you took the most obvious route out of the baggage recheck area for arriving international flights, you ended up in a terminal where you had to go through security again. This was another nightmare. The place was full of CLEAR staff trying to get you to sign up so you could ""skip the line,"" Okay, that sounds like a good idea. On attempt to sign up, we saw we already were enrolled in CLEAR.  They're not going to get a commission or meet their quote with us, so they direct us to an area in the line. Only problem was they wouldn't let us enter the CLEAR line (I'm not sure there even was one as every time I have attempted to utilize this option, I have ended up in the line of cattle on the way to slaughter). The line was endless and no signage indicating the regular line from TSA precheck (which we had printed on our boarding pass). Upon finally arriving at the checkpoint, my traveling companion was severely reprimanded to not being in the precheck line. Believe me, she would have been if there had been one that could have been identified. Simply put, no directions, rude staff, no one in charge to direct traffic and alleviate a crowded situation that could have been lessened by a simple bit of organization and human decency all combined made this one of the most horrible experiences of my life. CLEAR is a joke, JFK is a joke and any travel through this airport has become the number 1 airport in the US to avoid.",-1,JFK

The employees, from weighing and checking our bags (scan didn’t work!) to having our id’s checked to going through security were nasty, rude, and unpleasant. They purposely mumbled and spoke so low that you couldn’t hear them and when you asked them to repeat they were SO COLD and NASTY. They looked miserable as if they didn’t want to be there. Then leave because you are making everyone else miserable! Robots would have been more pleasant. They barely looked at you and you were treated as sub-human. In contrast, the employees at CHS Airport we’re friendly, kind, and very pleasant. New York has a very bad reputation for being rude and disrespectful and JFK airport gives credence to this. I am ashamed that I live in a state where an airport is so horrific. I will no longer be taking flights from this horror of an airport. JFK employees should be fired and should be replaced with people who are happy and thankful to have a job in this precarious economic state. Shame on you, employees at JFK.

It was also very unnecessary since people were pushing their bags down at a steady rate. When I asked why they were throwing my things, I was confronted by 2 TSA women who started arguing with me and saying “I was weird” I just don’t understand why they are allowed to get away with treating people like cattle… it’s TSA not secret service.

We returned from Barcelona to LAX with a stop at JFK. We were given a tag for express-lane to pick up our luggage, go through custom and TSA. Unfortunately, the TSA staff mixed up the regular travelers with those with the ""Express-Lane"" to make the connecting flight. The TSA staff and customs staff have all appeared to be uninterested in their jobs as if they wished to be elsewhere. Chaos is evident everywhere. As a result, we ran and were barely made it to our flight to LAX - 5 minutes before the take off time.

I laid myself down on the floor then I heard the voice saying that I was not allowed to ‘lie down on the floor.’ It was around 2am. So I woke up, and packed myself when the voice came up to me again to make sure. I moved on, looking for a bathroom and the voice called me again. She stopped me and asked where I was going. I said bathroom. She said that’s okay and told me direction to the bathroom, which was literally in front of me. She added that the Food Court was closed if I were to go there. First, I was not, and second, I knew it was closed anyway, but I did not bother to answer. After the bathroom, I started to looking for a new spot to sit down. Then I just thought that I might have a short breeze near the exit, but the door was closed. I waved my hand under the sensor once or twice then quit, and was about to resume my search for the chair. Then she ran up again and said the terminal was closed. I said I could see that, and asked her if she was following me. She said I was not allowed to roam around  the airport because the terminal was closed. But there were other people in the terminal! I said I was on my way to find a seat. She said I could sit anywhere, and I said I was on my way to the seat closer to my airline. She then said that I had to leave the terminal because my flight was to leave ‘tomorrow.’ It was 2:20am and my flight was 1pm, on the same day. She told me to leave immediately or she would call the police - she said it more than 5 times. I asked her what I was supposed to do, and she said I should leave immediately and come back after 6am. She blocking me with her body in case I go anywhere when I was not even moving. I hopped in the elevator as she said. I could see her calling someone with her wireless set to make sure I do not stay in the building. I landed on the 1st floor, with shock, horror and confusion. I tried to look up any hotels around the airport to go, but it took less than 30 seconds until the man, who got her call came up to me. He kindly advised me that the terminal 8 is open 24 hours. I asked him the direction, when she ran down to the first floor, cutting his words. She said “No, she’s not going to the third floor. Go out right here and walk across the street.” I said I would check with internet and she kept repeating that she would call the police. When I was waiting for the red light to change to green in front of the cross, I could see her watching me until I cross the street fully from inside. That was very creepy. It was 2:25am. Anyhow, I made it to the terminal 8, and guess what? There are so many people sleeping on the floor! Am I not allowed to come to the airport too early? I always thought that arriving in the airport earlier is always better than being late, but I guess this does not apply to JFK? I am just shocked and horrified that such a big international airport like JFK could kick an international guest like that manner.",-1,JFK

The signs were not put in the right place, which had lead lots of passengers in the wrong line and the staff was really rude, not giving explanations or right indications. Restroom was dirty and we had a really bad experience with almost everything.",-1,JFK
2022-05-02,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,the most horrific experience,True,"  Probably the most horrific experience in my entire life. I boarded my flight from terminal 8 of JFK where I arrived 3 and half hours before flight. The airport was terribly overcrowded. Where in the world domestic and international passengers are checking in at same kiosks? A handful of highly uncooperative staff was available to help herd! of passengers at self-check-in kiosks so, I could not get any help in spite of literally begging from 3 staff when I was not able to scan my wife passport. Finally, one staff told me to go another counter. After standing in Queue for half an hour I was told that I was at wrong counter and should go to other counter. After standing in queue at that counter for 15 minutes, I was told that I should fill the immigration form of Peru by scanning QR code from the machine installed at a point in airport. I and at least 10 of other passengers were struggling to connect to Wi-Fi of airport to scan the code. When I went to some staff to report this issue their straight answer was “this issue is not their problem” and when I said that I will miss my flight, unfortunately instead of having a word of sympathy the answer was “it’s not their problem”. Anyways, I kept on trying for next half an hour to finally connect Wi-Fi of airport to find that it was not the “immigration form” it was “health declaration form” which I had already filled. Airport staff should at least know the exact terminology and difference between immigration form and health declaration form. Anyways, finally I stand in a long queue to find that I was not the only one, majority of the people in that line who like me were about to miss their flight or had already missed their flight in spite of reaching 3 hours prior due to utter chaos, incoordination and red tapism. I requested at least 3 staff to consider me early but in vain. Finally, I reached at check in counter to find that there was 1 pound extra in one bag (while other 3 bags were short of 30 pounds) but still the lady asked us to open our lock and shift our load to another bag. While we were doing so, she went for short break. The misery didn’t end here, security staff opened the bag of my wife to remove creams, lotions etc. (which we were open and were sure less than 100 ml; moreover, we had crossed 3 airports before in other countries with the same stuff). When I requested them to please do it little fast otherwise I will miss my flight, their answer was again “that’s not their problem” Finally, we sprinted to reach our flight departure gate which was about to close in next 5-10 minutes. At gate I was told that my cabin baggage is oversized (the same bag approved by check in staff became oversize after reaching at departure gate!). Anyways, finally we boarded our flight after depleting all adrenaline and other stress hormones. My request from authorities is:  At least separate domestic and international departures. Increase staff to help passengers at web check in kiosks. Ask staff to be compassionate towards passengers. Just bluntly saying that it not their problem does not solve the problem rather disheartens you. Start feedback system of international passengers to understand their agonies. Do a survey to find that how many international passengers are missing their flights and then compare with other countries.",-1,JFK
2022-04-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,JFK is a joke,False,"  JFK is a joke - from the redundant and thoughtless procedures, to the lack of useful signage when flying internally, to a staff that barely speak English, to the bar waitresses that add their own tip amounts to your food bill. Worst internal flying experience. I will fly out of my way and pay more to avoid this idiotic hell hole.",-1,JFK
2022-04-18,0.2,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,the worst airport I have ever visited,True,"  Without a doubt, this has to be the worst airport I have ever visited. The Airport itself was okay, but the staff is something else! From check-in to security to the stores, the staff were rude, unwelcoming, and disrespectful. On checking our luggage, they were systematically thrown onto the conveyor belt in front of our eyes. The security line was an absolute joke – here we had a couple of men who were shouting and barking orders at everyone and treated everyone as if they were incompetent. Security staff stood idly by and just watched as the security trays were becoming backlogged, thus creating more delays. I had to remove 6-8 of the trays myself in order to get the line moving. As to the staff within the stores and restaurants, well, a certain fast-food franchise should be ashamed of themselves. Have never been spoken so rudely in all my life. The staff of a certain fragrance store and Hudson News had no people skills whatsoever. They obviously didn’t want to be there.",-1,JFK

2022-03-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,absolute worst airport experience,True,  This was my absolute worst airport experience. Arrived from Heathrow and needed to transit to Nashville - we had a three hour window. Long story short we missed our connection due to the chaos at immigration. Out of 60 booths at times two were manned and they said there was a computer glitch which meant no non-US passengers were being processed. We queued for over two hours. Nobody cared. Delta staff were very helpful and we were transferred to a later flight. We had dinner in T4 and it was cold and the power went out What a disgrace and a terrible introduction to the US.,-1,JFK

I explained I had already been through security checkpoints ,I had my boarding pass they kicked me out and told me they were going to call the police on me because I was in the area that I should not of been in which was the gate 1 flight 7 Alaska to Seattle.

The way they were interacting it was obvious the knew each other, how can I feel secure when we a TSA helps their friend to skip the process, what else do they do?

Walked the entire terminal looking for a bottle of water. Not one beverage vending machine. Every vending machine I came across sold either Sim cards or headphones.

But we had to wait 45 minutes for a gate to deplane, and then another hour for luggage to arrive at baggage claim. It’s just miserable. Stay away if you can.",-1,JFK
2021-10-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,This place is a disgrace,False,"  Me and my husband arrived several hours late from our JetBlue flight, from Mexico, because of a delay. We were in Mexico & were told by the attendants numerous times that it wouldn't be much longer, only 15 more minutes. Instead of telling anyone the truth they had us all waiting around for HOURS. This was along with numerous others. Finally we boarded & arrived at JFK around 11pm and were told by the rude attendant that there was not another flight until 9:30 am, because we missed our flight. We told her it was of no fault of ours or anyone of the many others who arrived late due to JetBlues issue. After telling her that we were waiting for our other flight from 1:40pm-6pm and that we had no where to go, she conveniently found a flight at 4:30am. Other guests were told the same thing and we're forced to book their hotel at the airport for the night. We then asked where we could go for the next several hours. She told us there was a lounge downstairs. When we got down there, there were already others sitting around, exhausted. We weren't there for long when the security guard told everyone that they couldn't sit in the lounge area, because they were going to clean it .. while all of us had no to go. My husband and I went back upstairs to find a bunch of people, families & small children, sitting, even laying all over the floor because nothing was open for anyone yet and there were no chairs. What is the point of having a large lounge area, with seating, when no one can use it? So now there are a bunch of customers just lying around, on the floor, exhausted, waiting for the gates to open. This place is a disgrace. No wonder why there are so MANY negative reviews. It's sad to see that Nothing is changing.",-1,JFK
2021-09-01,0.3,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Very bad experience,False,"  Rude airport staff. No consideration for passenger. No help when requested, no will to help. The agent at the TSA was not nice with my children and the agents were rude. They made us wait so long for an insignificant matter that we missed our flight. Very bad experience.",-1,JFK
2021-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,The bags were sitting there for hours unattended,False,"  I strongly believe there are very serious security lapses at New York JFK Airport. On Friday 27 Aug we arrived at JFK from an International origin as transfer passengers enroute to Washington DCA Airport. Our luggage was tagged from origin all the way thru to DCA. The luggage was off loaded from the aircraft and placed on baggage claim while we waited in line 2 hours to re-enter border passport control where only 5-6 agents were processing over 500 passengers, the employees handling the crowd could barely speak English and were extremely rude and unprofessional. Some airport employee placed our baggage at a transfer kiosk and left it sitting there unattended. There was an airport employee standing at a door doing nothing so we asked her why our luggage was just sitting there so long and she said someone would be there so we waited up to 30 minutes. The bags were sitting there for hours unattended because nobody would come and handle our bags and put them in a secure staging area for our connecting flight. We tried asking why and employees would just turn their backs and ignore us. We decided to take matters into our own hands and recheck our baggage at Delta Airlines Ticket counter. We just walked away from there with our bags and nobody said anything so there was “unaccounted for” bags now. After taking a tram and going up and down stairs to 3 different terminals we found an employee that placed our bags onto the incoming baggage belt where we hoped it would find its way to Washington DCA. We then took more trams to a shuttle bus which took us to another terminal where we went thru an absolute chaotic security without any instruction people were yelling pushing and shoving running and our Delta flight gate changed 3 times and was 2 hours late departing. Delta was late on our first flight and lost our bags at JFK and we got them 2 days later overseas while on vacation. It is impossible to navigate JFK because there are no maps and simple instructions for foreign passengers, you must ask one of the extremely rude barely English speaking airport employees who can’t explain the complexity of finding your next terminal. You will have to run everywhere because transfer is so difficult and time consuming and information is unavailable. This airport is also dirty, smelly and worn out old. I would be willing to pay much more money to avoid New York all together for my next International Flight but it is so hard any International flights in the central USA.",-1,JFK

2021-05-31,1.0,Business,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,most importantly he actually found my purse,True," I left my purse on the flight, and ran back to the airport to get it. There was nobody at Delta to help me and I was so scared because all my identification, medications, and my last paycheck were all in that bag. I was desperately looking for help. Then the sweetest man, an agent who checks boarding passes right before TSA, helped me. He was patient, calmed me down, was quick, efficient, and most importantly he actually found my purse. I know I got really lucky because it was the plane's last stop, but if I hadn't come across someone as kind I probably would have never gotten it back. I thank him and everyone who was involved in recuperating my purse from the bottom of my heart. You all could have chosen to take it, steal the contents, or just thrown it in the trash but everybody had a lot of good in them that night.",1,JFK

2020-06-10,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a horrible horrible experience,False,"  The worst airport ever. All NYC airport staff generally rank low in terms of attitude and manners. It isn’t uncommon to be greeted with a very confrontational service. On this occasion I had booked NYC as a family holiday and left by the end of the week feeling so upset. A woman and man working at security shouted at my and my family completely unnecessarily. They demanded we fold down our pram with my sleeping 1 year old baby in it and then shouted at us to get her out and the to move on immediately whilst other members of staff watched with complete indifference and smiled. It was a horrible horrible experience. They created an unbelievably tense and hostile environment, which the staff almost fed off. It was not the best holiday given an UBER driver demanded $250 after taking us from JFK to our hotel, and the hotel mixed our rooms up (the Maxwell on Lexington Avenue) Leaving 5 of us to share a double room for 5 days. All in all an awful experience made even worse by the airport staff.",-1,JFK

2020-03-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,the slowest staff ever,False,"  Worst airport I’ve ever arrived into. Huge queues probably due to the slowest staff ever. Despite queues out of the door and we were there for over 2 hours, staff could be seen chatting to each other between customers (not asking for next in line due to talking) and then taking an age to process, the whole time being very unfriendly and downright rude! Worst security checks anywhere.",-1,JFK
2020-03-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,security is totally unreasonable,False," Terminal 4. The security line set up is totally unreasonable. There is one PreCheck line and no separate ""CLEAR"" line. The ""CLEAR"" machine and staff are placed at the front of TSA PreCheck line, allowing CLEAR customers to cut through the PreCheck line. Really? CLEAR has higher priority than PreCheck? If so, TSA should announce it, so people can decide to buy CLEAR instead of PreCheck. I believe the CLEAR machines and staff should be placed at the end of PreCheck line or a separate area away from the PreCheck line, so when they are confirmed CLEAR, they can get in PreCheck line like all the other PreCheck customers. I suspect CLEAR pays TSA or the airport the get their program this unofficial advantage.",-1,JFK

Rude, ignorant staff treating people like animals, absolutely shocking. If you treat people like this you will get treated back like it. I have never witnessed so many angry pasengers.

2019-12-28,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,the lines for security were so long,False,"  Absolutely despicable. I have never in my life seen an airport be so disorganised, the staff so so rude, and the lines for security were so long!! All over the world they do it so much better, JFK security is manned by power tripping morons! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and security (travelling with 5 of us, 3 children), and we missed our flight by 5 min! When we were going through security the rude arrogant lady opened every single present my children received for Christmas, opening up the toys with a screwdriver. They do this for phones, iPads, Nintendo switch! Why would they do it for a Harry Potter wand and a Star Wars droid, that I wouldn’t be surprised if it even works now, never been used! Why can’t the X-ray scanner see if there is anything inside it like all other luggage! My son was upset seeing her pull apart his droid which seemed to spur her on in her arrogance and self importance! My daughter who wears an arm brace for her recently operated on elbow gets patted down at each airport, not at JFK, they seem to think 3 different people should pat her down, then they stood there and argued about who is more important and who should’ve done it first! The arrogant self important lady who took a screwdriver to my sons toy, was more upset that she didn’t get to do the pat down than anything, taking pleasure in not only treating us and anyone around her with disrespect and contempt, but the staff that she works with as well! It took us 48min alone to just get through security. I respect the process, but it doesn’t need to be this unpleasant! After all of this the morons at security let through my sons medication which was 250ml of liquid and a pair of scissors (but thank goodness his Harry Potter wand was scrutinised for hidden things). I only know they let these things through because after missing our flight boarding (the plane was still there and the ramp just shut) we went to LeGuardia airport to wait with 3 children for 5 hours on standby and their security picked them up! But guess what, they just scanned the Star Wars droid and Harry Potter wand like any other airport in the free world. Shame on you JFK, clearly you need to invest in visiting first world airports in other major cities around the world, clone what they do, and then maybe you may measure up on the world scale! At the moment you fail dismally and are at the very bottom of the pile.",-1,JFK

I feel such embarrassment when I am in this airport as a New Yorker. I have been all around the world and I’ve never been treated so poorly in an airport or had to watch others treated so terribly. The staff seem untrained. They don’t treat anyone with dignity or even minimal respect. They are rude and abrupt and won’t assist those who are confused or in need even though customs and baggage claim is a mess and horrendously confusing. I have seen actual staff snap at people asking reasonable questions or for help, downright ignoring them while socialising with colleagues, elderly people asking for assistance to be ignored. The best you are treated is someone just doing their job and acting like you don’t exist. For example, taking your bag from you at recheck without a word, checking your passport but looking right through you like you’re not there without even a hello or smile or even a nod. I had a 5 hour layover and they didn’t manage to get my luggage to my next flight on Time. It’s such a sad, sad state. Positives are I had a wonderful waiter at a restaurant and they have water bottle refill stations. Also some decent shops. Just doesn’t make up for the other very upsetting bits and how uncomfortable I felt. Unfortunate as it’s such a great city, but avoid this airport at all costs.",-1,JFK

The signs to direct people are very confusing which caused my husband to have to queue twice. I am still waiting for my husband as I write this! It took approximately 2hrs 20mins for me to get through passport control and dread to think how long I will be waiting for my husband.

I have traveled all over the world and never experienced the delays in trying to get through security. Not only were they understaffed and under trained the two officials attending the screening area prior to being screen were the rudest and lacking total customer experience acted in the worst manner? There were numerous customers pleading to get through as we all were on the same flight and had 10 minutes before the door was closed on the plane and this is after being in line for almost 50 minutes! Never in my life have I waited so long and after numerous requests to let the people go through she completely lost control and screaming at us at and then decided to stop the screening process and send us back to the end of the line! I demanded her supervisor and she blatantly lied and said we were line jumpers. Thankfully after explaining to the supervisor he turned it back on to allow people to continue to be screened a young woman with two young children in front of us was so upset and distraught stead a total mess we were able to make the flight by running and with a couple of minutes to spare I’m in my late 60s as is my wife and we both have disabilities and if this is acceptable behaviour by staff at JFK and accordingly no apology was offered by anyone it’s a disgrace and obviously the women in particular who were on duty last night have no idea what so ever what it’s like to be put in that situation!! On the positive side the staff of Jetblue were amazing and kept the plane trip as comfortably as possible knowing that half the plane experience the check in GP,-1,JFK

Arriving at Jamaica Station well ahead of time we were informed the JFK Sky Train was not in service and shuttles were being supplied instead. We queued for 2 hours, amongst hundreds of other passengers as only 2 buses were sent. No JFK employees were available to update passengers what was happening throughout. Eventually being hoarded onto an over crowded bus which was supposed to be to the terminal, everyone had to get off and stand in the snow and raining for a further 20 minutes to transfer bus. Again no JFK employees were available to co-ordinate the situation. Having finally arrived and boarded the plane, we sat on the plane for 3 hours beyond our scheduled departure. With the captain stating no one at JFK Flight Control was able to be contacted - destining the situation like a ‘circus’. Several other flights were in the same situation. We have now missed connecting flights and face a 6 hour delay. A very poorly managed airport, with terrible communication and a clear lack of staff and coordination. Terribly run organisation, which I hope not to travel through again. Embarrassing showcase for New York City to worldwide travellers.",-1,JFK
2019-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,Horrible customer service,False,  Horrible customer service. Was sitting in the plane not allowed to get off for over an hour after a 7+ hour flight. No help by JFK to try and help the passengers off and find a gate. Unacceptable.,-1,JFK

2019-11-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2 hours in a queue,False,  Worst immigration system I’ve ever experienced! 2 hours in a queue that barely moved. As more fights landed the queues got longer and still a maximum of 2 officers checked people through customs. I will never fly through this airport again. Absolute disgraceful way to treat visitors and puts me totally off coming back to New York.,-1,JFK
2019-11-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,Poor experience in general,True," Probably the worst airport experience in a major city. The queue time is long and the line is inefficiently managed. The airport staff is very unpleasant, not nice or polite to travellers with lots of screaming and directing. Many bags were opened for no real reason just to hold out the line. The staff at food shops are half-asleep and made diners wait just to fix their nails and gloves. Poor experience in general and was definitely not expecting this level of service at a major airport.",-1,JFK
2019-11-13,0.3,Business,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,security guard asked me to leave Departures,False,"  I was early for a flight at 08.05, 12th November 2019. Went up through security and sat by my gate. At 00.30, a civilian security guard asked me to leave Departures as it was more than 4 hours until my flight. This would mean leaving departures. Going to arrivals and re-submitting my luggage and self back through security. This may or may not be correct although the official website does suggest you are at the terminal at least 3 hours before international flights. Anyway the security guard, who was not rude, refused to identify himself by name or personnel number. I pointed out that I would neeed either for a complaint. He stated, 'just tell them security told you that had to'. I spoke to security downstairs, after going back to arrivals. Again professional, however, they said that complaint could not be made as I couldn't identify the guard. Firstly, I pointed out that, that was because he wouldn't identify himself. Secondly, he spoke to me at 00.30 approximately at gate 9, therefore, not an insolvuable problem. I spoke to the security ops and raised my concerns. If I am to admitted 4 hours before flight then that is now only 1 hour 15 away. Where am I supposed to go for that long? Instead arrivals is like, a not entirely clean, zombie movie. A pity most staff really good.",-1,JFK
2019-11-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,nothing but bullying and humiliating people,False,"  My wife broke her wrist and small finger and her hand was in a cast the day before. Because she was walking unsteadily, we decided it is better that she be in a wheelchair. When we arrive at the security, she was asked to stand up. Trying to comply, she stood rather unsteadily. The immigration officer kept her standing for while. Another officer asked her to go in through another screen but this same officer scolded her and told her to stand there saying words to the effect, ""How many times have I got to tell you to stand there?"" When he finally deigned to let her go through the security screen, she found herself held up at the other side as two officer tried to find out if her plaster cast on her hand was real or not. ""It's real"" they concluded finally! We complained to the supervisor who was seated after that and she promise to take action. Whether she did or not we don't know. This is nothing but bullying and humiliating people who have visited the US to spend money and was unfortunate to have a fall. If this is how the US customs treat people I think there are many other countries we can go to. We have resolved not to go back to the US for a long time to come.",-1,JFK

You can compare it with the one of Cuba Havana with the only difference that there is WiFi, which was not working when we arrived. Security queues where really long when we arrived. All staff (except for 1 funny guy) was unfriendly and not helping customers. Temperature control was really awful. It switched from really hot to windy for a few seconds. Air quality was really breath taking and foods and shops were really not up to standard European airport standards. Really strange that one of the biggest cities in the world has an airport like this.",-1,JFK

2019-11-01,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,Training is urgently needed,True," My children and I were going through security and had made sure to take off shoes and load trays in readiness for the x-ray machine. In the UK, where we are from, all shoes, coats and bags need to be loaded into trays so this is what we did. Suddenly we found ourselves being shouted at aggressively by a female security attendant who was angry that we hadn’t understood her barked orders to remove bags and shoes from trays. My young son was getting flustered as she was so aggressive in her manner (his first long distance trip) and so she sighed loudly, made some derogatory remark and then removed his shoes angrily from a tray and banged them onto the conveyor belt. Her behaviour was so rude and I politely told her so, whereupon she shouted “I’m not being rude. If you listened the first time there wouldn’t be a problem!” A second attendant then shouted at several of us for standing too close to the gate by the scanner. My sons and I were shocked by the aggressive and rude way we were treated, and other passengers expressed similar feelings. How on earth would people with learning difficulties or other frailties cope with this treatment?! Upsetting end to our holiday in the USA - made us glad to be getting back on a plane to the UK! Training is urgently needed to remind these people that travellers are human beings with feelings, who are paying a lot of money for their flights and who deserve to be treated with basic respect! After security we paid a lot of money for food that arrived cold and after a very long wait. Overall not a positive experience.",-1,JFK

My mother taught me to smile and say “please” and “thankyou”. Incompetent and inefficient setup; have they never seen how other international airports work? Please someone, go visit Changi or Haneda to see how to do it properly. On arrival, there was just one immigration officer for two full planes. Long lines of unhappy people ordered around like cattle. I’ve previously missed connecting flights due to extremely long wait times in immigration. On departure, surly staff are needlessly rude. Security is a joke with little understanding of the concept of flow. Terminal 7 is small with very basic amenities. I’ve travelled internationally every month for the last 25-years, and in my experience, JFK is one of the worst airports in the world. If first and last impressions matter, then JFK is a total fail and does NYC a massive disservice. Avoid if at all possible.",-1,JFK

I know that TSA will randomly open and check a bag which I have no problem with, however, I had 2 carefully packaged whiskey glasses from Hudson Valley Distillers which were missing. It is a shame when those who have the job of security cannot be trusted. The glasses were of very little value monetarily but a reminder of an otherwise wonderful trip. I was told a long time ago that you are only worth what you are willing to lie or steal for, in this case about $5, oh worthy individuals. Maybe TSA should make those who open a bag register and do so under camera surveillance. Who's the real security threat? Oct 19 Jetblue flight 161 from JFK to Sacramento in case anyone cares",-1,JFK
2019-10-19,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,3.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,the worst arrivals experience,True,"  This was the worst arrivals experience I have ever had. I have visited many airports, including some in developing African countries and JFK stands out from all of them. Standing in a queue for 2 hours (with 2 children) just to get through immigration is totally unacceptable. I thought maybe there were some staff on strike or something, but no, there just weren't enough staff - only about half of the counters were open. Why? When we finally got through our baggage was on the floor next to the carousel - it had had to be taken off so that the carousel could be used for another flight! None of the staff I asked could tell me why the queue was so long (when we were at the back and couldn't see what was going on). One lady, when I said ""excuse me, can you tell me what's going on?"" Just said ""No"" and carried on walking! Absolutely dreadful after an eight hour flight. My daughter went to the toilet after we finally retrieved our baggage and said they were disgusting. And when we got I to a taxi and told the driver where we needed to go, which was an airport hotel, he asked ""where is that?"" and I had to give him the full address! I hadn't realised London was such a paradise. I hope never to fly in to this airport again.",-1,JFK
2019-10-14,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,1.0,staff in the airport were unhelpful,True,"  This is the worst experience I have had in an airport. 3 hours was not enough to get through immigration and transfer to the connecting flight. The airlines say that they were on time so, it’s not their fault. Nobody will pay for a hotel until we can get on another flight to our final destination. All the staff in the airport were unhelpful, even the supervisor who advised us to come back to her after 30 minutes if we had not gotten to the security checkpoint. She just said we had to kept waiting, and, as a result, we missed our transfer. I used to like the USA. I now have no intention of coming back or spending any money on American products.",-1,JFK

2019-09-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,The experience was terrible,False,"  I was extremely disappointed in the customer service at JFK airport. I had numerous encounters where staff/individuals were unwilling to assist with questions, I was told different agents to see, multiple numbers to call, I was told to not step up to a counter without being “told” by agent and then told to step up and fill in gaps when there were gaps in TSA lines - I assimilated this experience with being a cattle in a barnyard - quite inhuman. The experience was terrible and I will go to great lengths to not fly through the airport in the future. Lastly the personnel gives your city and our nation a bad image for visitors and I hope you think about how to train staff in a more effective manner.",-1,JFK

Rude, incompetent staff who were scruffy, sour faced and unhelpful and who were screaming unintelligible instructions to confused passengers of all ages. Endless snaking lines, absolute chaos. I have travelled extensively and have never, ever seen such a disgusting airport and staff. (perhaps the exception here is La Guardia Airport) How can New York put up with this being the first impression international travelers get when they arrive in the United States?

2019-08-27,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,this is an embarrassment,True," I’m almost speechless. For an international airport this is an embarrassment. We flew from Terminal 7 and I would recommend everyone avoid if they can. Filthy, cramped, disgusting toilets, and the limited selection of hugely overpriced and underwhelming food is laughable, particularly the utterly nonsensical ordering system which involves not one trip to a cashier but 3. WiFi impossible to connect to, very limited selection of shops to pass the time in & staff rushed and rude. I thought Frankfurt airport was bad but this is on a level if not worse.",-1,JFK

We arrived from Manchester and queued 1 and a half hours to get through immigration. After a 7 hour flight this really is not ideal. I witnessed one lady member of staff whilst directing people as to which queue they should go in, talking to and pulling facial expressions which were totally unacceptable. When we departed to go back to the UK I was absolutely appalled at the rudeness of one member of staff. We were taken 2 floors down to an alternative security area (due to the security area in departures being too busy). The organisation was ridiculous. One lady spoke to my 2 teenage sons in a totally disrespectful and rude manner. Totally uncalled for. She spoke to them like they were stupid - they are far from stupid. I am annoyed with myself for not saying anything at the time, however, I was stunned and also in the position of possibly affecting our ability to board the flight had I confronted her. The staff in this airport are rude.",-1,JFK
2019-08-15,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,One of the worst,False,"  One of the worst airports ever. Staff are extremely unfriendly and the queues last forever.

Terminal size is poky. No decent shopping. Will never return via this airport - amazed at such poor facilities servicing one of the busiest cities in the world. Once again food prices are a disgrace.,-1,JFK
2019-07-30,0.4,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,terminal to terminal is a hassle,True,"  I arrived at JFK from Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight in May 2019, used it for both arrival and departure on JetBlue in June 2019, and then used it for transit from a JetBlue flight to a Philippine Airlines flight in July 2019. Sure, you can get to this airport from seemingly anywhere around the world, and it services the exciting city of New York. The TSA agents typically are surprisingly decent too. And check-in staff are usually pretty nice. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the extent of the positives about this airport. Upon arrival in Terminal 1, I was greeted by a customs and immigration facility that appeared to be under construction. It looked awful - all torn up! A passport control officer was basically just waving all of us in the U.S. Citizens line through while wishing us a good one. It seemed to take a really long time for luggage to arrive on the carousel. I don't mean my luggage personally. I mean anyone's luggage! Meanwhile, staff informed my parents (who were picking me up there) that everyone from our flight had already exited customs - when none of us had yet! My first flight into JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight out of JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight back to JFK on JetBlue was delayed. I think the only reason my flight back to Manila on Philippine Airlines was NOT delayed was that it took off at 3:45 A.M., when no one else was flying out of the airport! Transiting from terminal to terminal is a hassle, too. It requires exiting your first terminal, walking down a seemingly endless hallway to the AirTrain, taking the AirTrain to your second terminal's stop, and then walking down another seemingly endless hallway to that terminal proper. Then, of course, because you're coming in from outside the secure area, you have to go through security all over again! As for food and beverage outlets, most appear to range from relatively expensive to borderline price gouging. One very notable exception was the Dunkin' Donuts landside in Terminal 1. It appears to be the only dining option available 24 hours, and so it was the only place I could use my $20 meal voucher landside, since my flight departed in the middle of the night. At Dunkin' Donuts, I was informed that if I was going to use my meal voucher, then I had to spend at least $20. I was astonished! I struggled to manage to buy $20 worth of food and drink there. I made myself sick. I still do not understand why they would not accept the voucher for a smaller amount. It's not like they would be losing money on the deal! Add to all of this restrooms which are often not very clean and with sensors which automatically turn on sink faucets when you're nowhere near them (but don't turn on when you are near them). Finally, there's the issue of the airport's being quite far from Manhattan. I've heard LaGuardia and Newark are even worse. If so, then heaven help the people who fly out of there!",-1,JFK

2019-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,never met staff as rude,False,"  Have never met staff as rude as they are at this airport! Arrived from London and was told by airline staff to go in the quick connect queue for our connecting flight to Orlando. A member of staff came over screaming at us that we were in the wrong queue, when I asked where we were supposed to go she just shouted “read the signs”. We ended up in a queue behind at least 50 people with one desk open. When it got to 15 minutes before our gate was due to close I asked several members of staff for assistance only to be ignored and told to wait. I managed to persuade fellow passengers to let me and my group go to the front of the queue. We then had to collect our luggage and go back through departures and security to get our connecting flight. When we got to the gate it had been changed last minute and was in a different terminal. Running around the terminal trying to find a screen with the correct information was like a scene from Hone Alone!!! We then had to get a bus over to the new gate. I fully expected to have missed the flight however we were lucky in that the flight had arrived late. We got to the gate just as it was closing. Thankfully just in time. This airport is totally disorganised and probably the worst airport experience I’ve had. I wouldn’t fly here again.",-1,JFK

This airport is absolutely disgusting, however, I must admit that customs and TSA were good, and I actually found them polite. However, as for the rest of the airport, Delta is horribly rude, the restaurants are disgusting and the baggage carts are a total rip off, a scam, charging $6.00 for the use of them, and on top of that they scream at you, in Toronto there is no charge. Then I get to Seattle and Alaska and people are polite and helpful. Going through JFK you feel as if you're going through another dimension.",-1,JFK
2019-07-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,is a third world airport,False,"  As others have said, this is a third world airport. Avoid at all costs. The reason for this is the rudeness and total ineptness of  staff you come across. It seems that to wear a uniform at JFK airport turns that person in to someone who thinks they are head of the Military or Police. Let me tell you something, you can still be nice to people. YOU have to travel sometimes, does the experience of coming across someone with your attitude make you happy? Of course it doesn't. On Monday evening, all us travellers waiting to have our bags scanned were herded in to an area and made to wait. Huge unnecessary queues. How many x-ray scanners were available? Two. And they would let 4 or 5 people through at a time to the underworked customs staff. And not a smile anywhere. Thankfully I had Priority boarding which meant I could get through relatively quickly (about half an hour). I didn't bother with the priority boarding at the actual gate as the staff were clearly uninterested in this. If I ever have the misfortune of going through JFK again, I will make sure to be there at least 4 hours before the plane leaves. Coming through was relatively easy thanks to the ESTA process but getting shouted at by certain staff was amusing. Again, something to tell you: we love coming to visit but have no intention of wanting to stay in your lovely country illegally. Really, I like where I live. So, Florida next year. I am assuming they are still happy staff down there because, well, it's Florida. JFK staff could learn a lot from other countries where people love their jobs.The UK, Spain, France, Netherlands, Czech, Germany, South America, Australia, the list is endless.",-1,JFK

The heat was horrendous. Little children, babies and elderly people were all standing for hours in horrendous heat. Around half the booths were unmanned. There were few staff to help and signage showed that this was a regular occurrence. The whole place was scruffy, chaotic and a truly shameful introduction to a great nation. All Americans should be outraged that the management of this atrocious facility are providing a shockingly bad first impression of their nation. I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and Africa and can truly say this was my worst ever introduction to a country that really couldn't care less about the impression it gives to visitors.",-1,JFK

It was 3 pm on a Monday and it looked like every international flight had just landed. Utterly packed at customs with countless snaking, endless lines. No rhyme or reason what kiosk you went to. No order to the queuing. Airport staff just awful, not directing. Waited in line for 1.5 hrs. Then after finally getting through this horror, no directions to connecting flights, hardly any tv screens for departure gate times, they don’t tell you the terminal attached to the gate, so we wound up walking to gate B51, which was endless from customs. Totally antiquated, third world calibre airport. Shocking to see this in NYC. It needs to be demolished and rebuilt from scratch.

Apron arrival of the baggage claim, we were met with bad service and poor customer service. After waiting for an hour for our flight we went to the baggage service area. The workers obviously had better things to do, as it took them another hour to contact their manager. When they finally came, she just sat in the office typing away not helping us or giving us any updates except for saying that they were in fact loaded onto our plane and taken off, but they are unable to figure out where they were. I am on my way to a safari in South Africa, and was already pressed for time. There were two other people waiting there with us who had the same problem. I guess that paying for priority doesn’t mater because, in the end, we still lost our luggage. The moral of the story here is be cautious when flying and try to avoid Delta Air Lines.",-1,JFK

There is an older TSA who was standing there flexing the line. I informed him that I have 10 minutes before my plane leaves, is there any way to get assistance. I informed him that my family was actually all the way in the front and that I was behind because I had issues with my luggage. I repeated myself several times and he just kept on looking at me and shooing me away. This is extremely unprofessional as I am a manager myself. This is not the type of customer service they should be providing even though he is a TSA member. When I arrived to the check point, I informed another member that wasn’t part of TSA, she had gave me the same inappropriate manner. She said “I can’t do anything, stay in line”. This is the worst service ever. I hope senior managers can coach their employees here at this airport. This can ruin an individuals experience.",-1,JFK

It has a stupid, hard to figure out layout. I had to walk through the rain to change terminals. The gate areas were small and confusing as well. Then when I returned through customs and had some duty-free merchandise I was treated very rudely by a tsa worker in security and had some of my merchandise confiscated even though it was duty free and not brought from outside the airport! This is ridiculous and the worker was a complete jerk about the situation. I consider myself an understanding and patient person but this airport tested both!",-1,JFK

Upon arrival from the UK my family and I had to go through customs. I do not attribute the experience at customs with JFK but it was pretty bad as well. The customs officer was extremely rude and acted put off by being there. Once I got to security I realized we were precheck, yay for us right? I was told that we didn't need to take our shoes off by the officer checking our passes. Then we were yelled at by the lady at the scanning belt that we had to take out shoes off, then she yelled at us for putting our carry on bags in the bins (I don't want my bags on the dirty belts), she continued to roll her eyes while yelling at us.

This is the first and sometimes only American operation thousands of international travelers see every day, and y'all should not be proud. I need to use the restroom, there is urine on literally every toilet seat, can't imagine the last time this place was cleaned. The plug is so old and used it can't hold my laptop plug in place, I'm having to keep my leg against it right now to keep my laptop charging. The wifi I kid you not is not allowing me to stream Pandora, a music service. This is 2019 folks, come on this is a first rate embarrassment for an American airport.",-1,JFK

I was hoping it had improved since my last visit 4 years ago but I am afraid it was a shambles. The new esta system supported by self inputting machines make things worse and even then you still have to go through an interview with immigration. The hall was overwhelmed with people and staff who are very stressed and rude. I’ve been to four other American airports from the uk and this one exists from the dark ages. America you are letting yourself down. It’s a disgrace. We will not come back and I heard numerous other travellers saying the same thing.,-1,JFK

Total confusion and lack of clarity with no clear signage placed in the right positions is responsible in my opinion. The staff are abrasive and constantly shouting unclear instructions at the top of their voices. Long queues make for a very long wait together with the niggling doubt that you may be in the wrong queue because there is no clear signage or instruction. This was my first visit to New York, although not to the US, and my first impression of this city is one of very unwelcoming and rude customs staff. I have not experienced this at any of the other US airports I have arrived at. Surely someone needs to sort this out - perhaps management needs an overhaul. It seems ironic that the US prides itself on its customer service so what’s gone wrong here?",-1,JFK
2019-04-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,sorry treatment,True," JFK confirmed again today why it is my least favorite and most avoided airport. If it weren’t for the competitive international fares I’m able to acquire due to routing through this airport, I’d never come. My plane landed at 4:30a, closing out an all-night flight of 11-1/2 hours. We were first to Passport Control, but other flights also arrived and discharged their passengers. There were hundreds in line, and only one agent was checking in the sea of American citizens returning home. Airport staff barked directions at incoming passengers, but with no clarity or organization or apparent purpose, generating even more confusion and frustration. My husband and I were near the front of the line; still, it was an hour before our passports were cleared. Exiting Control we followed signs for Connecting Flights. The main Connecting lobby was closed, so someone shouted from the top of the escalator to come upstairs. Once there we had the “pleasure” of joining all the Departing Passengers - both those Connecting (like us) and those just starting their trips. We stood in long Security lines, were yelled at by TSA staff or rudely ignored, and ultimately had three of our five parcels inspected/rifled. The airline staff has been courteous and helpful and genuinely concerned with passenger comfort and safety. The JFK airport staff, however, is the complete antithesis. How embarrassing for all of us, knowing that millions receive this sorry treatment. Get your act together, NY. Future passengers, be warned. Maybe your experience will be a good one. Or maybe you, too will take away the degrading experience that was mine today. By the way, airport staff are warm and friendly with each other, even as the passengers they serve are wearily (and angrily) working their way through JFK’s cattle call process.",-1,JFK

We had to suffer over 2 hours of queuing in passport control which is totally unacceptable. We were penned in “cattle lines” for the duration. A total lack of staff and information. On exiting to the luggage carousel we couldn’t see a carousel with our flight on it. After walking about with no help or advice from staff we found our luggage lying in a pile in the corner. Things improved on the return as there was adequate staff. I will not use JFK again!,-1,JFK

I have been through many airports in my life. Staying in terminal 1 in JFK is one of the worst experiences for a long time. Had “dinner” at The Local - The food was worth a -2 star (minus 2) - had one bite of a burger and left the rest of the really overpriced food. I have never tasted something so bad and non prepared, not even ketchup could save this. Looking at the other restaurants and the ratings I can only imagine how bad they are as well. Not a single one have more than 3 stars and most are closer to 2 stars. JFK, JFK - what are you thinking having these bad restaurants? Is it on purpose, you would like a perfect vacation ending badly? It really feels like you do not care at all. The customer potential is huge, so why having all these non quality “restaurants”? To be honest I am amazed that “The Local” even have a license to serve food. For sure I will not put a cent in this terminal in the future. JFK, wake up now.",-1,JFK
2019-03-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Horrendous experience,False,"  Horrendous experience. I’m actually writing this as I’m stood in queue to get through passport control. So far it’s been a 1.5 hr wait with what I estimate to be another half hour at least till we actually get to the front of the queue. There is only 2 desks on (1 disabled and 1 able bodied) despite there being over 60 kiosks within the floor. We have a connecting flight to Las Vegas which I doubt we will actually make and there have been no apologies from staff in the slightest. There are no clear signs anywhere except throne at the start of the long snaking queue to say it would take 35 mins (which means that it’s now out by over an hour). Not a staff member in sight. Horrendous customer service with no professionalism. I can’t see any toilets and I am so thirsty it’s ridiculous. No refreshments. As I take over 33 pills a day for my illnesses I often need a drink as I get a dry mouth. No common courtesy given to anyone visiting this supposedly customer service friendly country. This isn’t at all about safety, this is purely down to an incompetent management. My advice - sack them all and start again! Terrible start to the holiday, was planning on visiting NYC with my daughter this coming February but definitely rethinking this after our experience today. Never known anything like it! I’ve attached photos of the queue (now 1hr 50 mins in) and the empty booths so you can see how inept staff are at making sure customers are dealt with swiftly and securely. This review wouldn’t allow me to leave a zero score as it’s needed a minimum of 1 star however if up to me then it would be a minus score. Take my advice fly into any other airport other than this one!",-1,JFK

The security check was very long, we had to wait about 30+ mins to get through and the queue wasn’t even that long. They had stopped and searched a woman and because they didn’t have any other woman officers, none of us women waiting could go through until they found what was setting off the alarm on her, again adding to the wait. The conveyer belt is the shortest I have seen which means all the baggage piles up until you are through the security check. Their website is wrong and they have very limited, over priced food options available which are limited to burgers or burgers or have I mentioned burgers! As a vegetarian and health conscious person this really has set me off on the wrong foot for our journey home. The shopping options again, are very limited and quite frankly equals to or even worse than a local small airport. I’ve heard BA had “invested” in the airport to make it better. I fear to think how it must have been before.",-1,JFK
2019-03-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,a long haul travellers nightmare,False,"  Honestly I would rarely review an airport but I was shocked at how truly awful this airport is. It’s a long haul travellers nightmare. This service would simply not run in the UK- it makes our busiest airports in London look timid by comparison. First off if you’re catching a connecting flight through here good luck, the airport is huge and it is not clear where you’re supposed to be going. Not great when this is your first time here. I was stood in a customs queue that wound on forever until I got panicky my connecting flight was in 40 mins. I stepped out to inform them and they told me to ‘go over there’. I wander over to a desk and a rude lady asks what I’m doing and I need to scan my passport first - well sorry the man did not tell me that! Wouldn’t it be helpful to tell me? They start whispering in another language and exchanging looks as if this isn’t an airport where new people enter every single day. I’m not thick thanks. Then comes the icing on the cake - the ever so fun customs lady who dragged her feet over to man 1 of 2 customs desks. She tells me she needs to sit down first and takes as long as possible with an attitude. Sorry I know the job is stressful but suck it up lady. Then she starts getting really intimidating telling me I’m not stood near the camera enough and I’m telling her sorry I’m flustered as I need to catch my flight. She seems totally unsympathetic and continues being rude. Sorry but I just got off a 7 hour flight from Manchester and I had 30 mins to get through security and to the gate - excuse me if I’m a little disoriented by your awful airport! She then makes me scan both my hands at least 11 times and it was very clear she was doing it to toy with me. I mean seriously who employs these people. Luckily I kept it together to avoid trouble but I have never met such rude airport staff in my life! I’m so glad I wasn’t travelling to NYC because boy what a welcome to that city. I know New Yorkers are known for being brash but they were just simply obnoxious and unprofessional. Boy was I glad to get to LAX in sunny California where the staff were lovely and helpful. I’ve never been particularly interested in NYC and it’s -10 weather as it seems like a more aggressive version of London and this airport just confirms my opinion on the place.",-1,JFK

Every so often one of the people manning the booth would walk away for about 5 minutes leaving just one booth open. It was taking an average of between 3 and 5 minutes per person going through immigration. There were other staff members wandering around but nobody seemed to take charge. It took us around 2 hours to get through this fiasco but by this time the queue was about 4 times bigger than when we arrived and one of the booths was about to close because the lady was going for lunch. I dread to think how long it took those poor people to get through. I was absolutely amazed that in a country renowned for its customer service, this was allowed to happen - where were the management, or at least somebody to take charge and get additional staff in.",-1,JFK

A nightmare after a 16 hour flight! Once out of the plane immigration procedures were next. A huge and extensive hall with plenty of booths but only one was open. One officer for 4 wide body aircrafts. Where are all the officers? Sleeping, chatting, taking a break? Welcome to the service desert called USA. Any questions raised are replied like you are a criminal, rude and agressive. Overall that gives any arriving visitor a good impression of what to expect within this snobbish and rude country. Try to avoid whenever possible. B.t.w., lack of immigration officers is common. At another time I experienced that 2 out of 53 counters were open.",-1,JFK

We were 4 hours early for a flight and just made it on time because of the very long queue both for check in and through security. Staff were extremely rude! In fact I saw a member of the public ask a member of staff if she worked for the airport as she needed help and the staff member simply said 'no' even though she was wearing a uniform and clearly on duty.

On arrival the staff were hostile (mainly the women) and in departure I overheard one security woman telling her colleague that people are “scared of her” to which she found this to be very amusing, another shouted orders in the face of an old woman telling her to pick up her tray off the floor, she was very intimidating and would have been better suited to working in a prison than in an airport. I was disgusted at this and how these people are a representation of your country, something needs to be done about the way they approach and interact with passengers. Most of the security were stood around in large groups talking and one women was whining about how she hated being theirs and wanted to go home. It was a horrible experience.",-1,JFK

The terminals differ enormously by size- Terminal 2 is very much smaller and very compact. Terminal 4 is huge with many stores and eateries requiring a lot of walking to and from your gate. On departure, I was surprised at the virtually non-existence security line. The gate areas have large glass panels and high ceilings. Lots of seating with electric power points. Quite a few eating places - including a Wendy’s - for a terminal with less than a dozen gates. My first time in Terminal 2 and highly recommend it. Delta had staff at the terminal entrance to assist you. Terminal 4 was very busy and required a long walk out from my gate. Just outside Terminal 4 is dedicated space for Uber and such service cars to come to pick up clients - this is very convenient. In short, my experience was quite positive and was very pleased with Terminal 2 especially.",1,JFK

I have taken taxis before and it was around $60. This driver told me I had to pay $8.50 in tolls. Talked the entire time telling me how hard he works and only makes $10 an hour.

Terminal 1 had the rudest staff I've ever encountered throughout any airport in the world. Completely unnecessary the way they talk with people. If you work at an international airport expect people to not speak English, yelling at them and talking down to them is not going to speed things up. I am not sure what the training procedures are for this place, but for any establishment to allow their staff to talk to their guests like this is wrong. Reading other reviews I am not the first to experience this. I am not sure who is running this place, but just because you are airport security doesn't give you the right to be a complete jerk to anyone. Basic human decency could be exercised even minimally and it would be a drastic improvement. Food selections are scarce and the place isn't exactly clean.

My husband asked him if the queue was for economy passengers (because the sign read for first and business class passengers only), this person replied ‘I am not here to answer your questions, show me your boarding pass’, taken aback by his rude reply my husband opened the bag to take out the passes, then this man started shouting ‘Don’t hold the line’ again and again in the most disrespectful manner possible. All this shouting and rude language was in the presence of our 4 year old child. Finally, we were in queue for security check. He was, without doubt, the most disrespectful staff member we have ever encountered having travelled across Europe, Asia and America. He needed training on usage of basic words like ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. Avoid this airport if possible.

Had to pay 100$ per bag after standing in another line for 1 hour. When we got angry, the JFK staff removed 100$ from the total. Which means it’s all utterly rubbish fees from the beginning. We traveled with Norweigan and I will never in my life fly with them or pass JFK again. The staff treat passengers as cattle. If travelling from/to Sweden, book SAS.

It was excessive! The Delta Sky Harbor Lounge was off limits to us because we did not have American Express Gold, Platinum, or Titanium credentials! It was the third such lounge in our itinerary and it failed! The staff seemed tired and aloof.

On our way to the Aer Lingus lounge in the terminal my youngest son and I stopped for a moment to check information when all of a sudden an airport staff member pushing a lady in a wheelchair almost ran into us with no warning or ""excuse me"". As I am an extremely polite person I quickly moved with my son and said sorry twice for being in the way, this staff member could very easily have gone around us anyway. As soon as we moved we didn't get a basic thanks instead this ""man"" called me an idiot in front of my son. This experience tainted my flying from JFK and annoys me to have been subjected to such ignorance and uncouth behaviour, in my opinion there should a complaints procedure which could highlight cases such as this. Staff lacking in basic people skills should be taken in hand and penalised.",-1,JFK

I have travelled to airports around and have never experienced such poor customer service and disorganisation. I have just finished queing at security control for just under 3 hours with no apology whatsoever. No one cares. I did this with my mum who has hip problems. The staff were slow and inconsiderate. Chatting amongst themselves and seemed to not care that they had queues and queues of people waiting for hours. Shocking. Absolutely shocking. Really didn’t expect this from an airport in one of the greatest cities in the world.,-1,JFK

",True," This is the first time I’ve ever complained about anything but I’m hoping it might ease my upset this afternoon at my awful experience at the border control of New York airport. The queue was long and slow and we waited patiently but when we got to the desk the staff member was so rude shouting at us to hurry up. Then when we stood as a family together (me my husband and two small children) he treated me with such an awful lack of respect. Using his temporary position of power to rest my reaction as he knew I couldn’t be rude back to him! He was such a bully. Very awful experience in front of my children. I wish I had taken his name as this boy needs to be taught a lesson, but I get the impression it’s a culture at the border control. An awful initial impression of the USA.",-1,JFK

When parked we had to stand in a corridor between the plane and the terminal for half an hour. We then had to queue for an hour and a half to go through passport control. The system was outdated, disorganised and inefficient. Once at passport control the equipment used to take fingerprints didn’t work meaning we had to spend another 20 minutes waiting in a back office. On our return journey to London we found the staff at JFK check in and security rude and unnecessarily abrupt. The departure lounge was small, outdated, worn, dirty and lacked shops and choices of restaurants. We were shocked to find that this large international airport was so old fashioned and provided a worse experience than all others we have travelled to and from in Europe, Asia and Africa.",-1,JFK

Next, the AirTrain is frequent, fast, and comfortable. Now, unfortunately, the negatives were many. Specifically, there are very few places to sit, yet thousands of people are traveling. No outliers for recharging phones. Few water fountains, and the water fountains that hang on the walls, are not working. In terms of places to eat few and far between, expensive and mediocre.

Departing at 2:50 in the afternoon, I found the security line to be relatively uncrowded. The bins on which we place our belongings to go through the X-ray machines are equipped with a sensor to detect suspicious items. My carry on was pulled off because it triggered a flag. It was opened but nothing was found. I spent an hour at the American Airlines lounge before the flight. Large windows looking out. A good spread of food and a wide range of self service drinks were available. Couches spread out that were comfortable and often offered privacy. Good place to wait before the flight. Lots of stores and eateries. Departure gate was crowded. An end gate, the area had shops and building pillars which together with many seats left little space to form queues prior to boarding. On return, plane arrived around 3 pm. A short walk to the immigration area. There were no lines. Used a machine to read the passport and presented the printout to the officer at his stall. No stamping in passport. With no checked baggage, I walked out to the arrivals hall and called a Uber car which arrived in 4 minutes. In less than 10 minutes from getting out of the plane, I was leaving the airport grounds. More often than not, I have found Terminal 8 a very pleasant and easy place to use and this time was no exception. Airport staff are helpful and signage are ample.",1,JFK

We landed at 13:10 and cleared customs, collected luggage and in a cab by 14:00! The ground staff were firm in their approach but certainly not rude, and helped with re-directing passengers into the appropriate lanes to allow quicker clearance. Again on return from T4 at JFK no big queues, staff pleasant and only took 40 mins to check in and make way through security.

I was travelling with my 10 year old son and they separated us a number of times with no concern for child safety. They were aggressive and I felt verbally attacked and oppressed.

Stall are generally rude. Saw a gate agent screaming at a very quiet and polite older man who simply wanted to know where the toilet was. Waiting by Gate B55 is excruciating as there is a defective piece of equipment that makes a constant metal scraping noise that no one seems to care about.

Got off the plane and took a photo of Lady Luck looking forward to our holidays after 12 hours of travel just to get here. Walked towards baggage claim and into passport control. We got in line and only one person dealing and then the wife noticed the 60 min wait time. One stroppy woman was barking at people to get in a certain line but none of it was clear to us. We don't live here. After 30 minutes the wife asked this rude lady about our line she mentioned as if we should have known thate we have an ESTA visa having been here in 2012. She told us, shouted at us to get in another line ESTA is valid for 10 years. We got in this new line relieved we might be out of here faster than we thought. The line she put us in reached a dead end. I walked sideways to grab another ladies attention whilst trapped in this belt system and she said go this way, pointing at anything she could, so dragging two heavy cases that's what we did to reach another dead end. I was losing it by now, tired and wanting to get to the hotel plus our suitcases were going round and round the baggage claim and could be nicked. I grabbed another bloke and he says use the machines. I put my passport in and it took my photo then said try again so I did. This time it gave me a print out that meant nothing to me so ""now what"" I thought. Wife put her passport in and her print out had a huge cross on it. What does this mean? We got to another passport control and he says you have to be manually processed but mine was ok. We both went back in yet another line and the people in front also from the UK said great welcome to the USA is it not. We slowly get through the queue and the pillocks who work here were of no help and not interested in helping. By the time we picked our cases up and got to the hotel by cab just 30 mins away it had taken four hours from landing the plane. What a useless outfit, just do not care at all. We pay their wages and these buffoons would not like it if it happened to them Training must be so bad here or non-existent. My advice is don't use this airport. Boston on our way home was perfection and we got through security etc in less that 20 minutes tops. We landed at Heathrow last Saturday and was out within 20 mins tops.",-1,JFK

Waited half an hour after landing for gate to open for us. The shuttle took twenty minutes to get us to terminal B, which stopped for a while in the middle of the tarmac for no visible reason a couple times. Terminal B is neglected and sparse. Where even are the trash cans? Where are the water fountains? You have to walk quite a ways to find a directory just to see if it's worth walking even more. Very little seating, few and far between shops and eateries. If you want to pay too much and wait way too long for a fast food burger, hit up Shake Shack. And if you want to do homework or read, too bad cause a football game is blaring at your gate. Your gate which has changed three times since you arrived two hours ago.

",True, We've just returned to the UK via JFK airport after a few days visit. Upon arriving - the queues for passport control were thoroughly ridiculous. Total time taken to proceed through immigration was well over an hour and a half plus a the time added for queuing before you get close to passport control. The whole arrivals experience is very unintuitive for passengers. When going to passport control you're greated by shouting staff who seem to only confuse matters more whilst being pretty rude to travellers throughout the process. Upon departing JFK - the queue for the security area was ridiculously long. Staff again shouting and being pretty rude to customers in general. Very disorganised and lots of staff around not seeming to be doing anything particularly useful. There just seemed to be a total lack of organisation and planned way of ensuring a flowing an intuitive experience for travellers with staff instead left to sort through the chaos as best they can. Pricing and quality of food and beverages on offer. Firstly I know all airport are expensive. JFK is ridiculously expensive - it's literally like management went round with a clipboard and said how can we screw our customers for every fine and give them the least in return. The food we had from the noodle bar was atrocious - $46 for soup and a couple of scoops of curry. Avoid purchasing food at this airport or anything for that matter. Clearly being run by accountants with no vision for experience and repeat customers. Rude disenfranchised staff. Poor unintuitive experience for travellers. Signage is very poor with just shops and dining wrote on the signs above walk ways instead of which shops etc. This means customers have to walk all over this place and it's a lottery if you have gone the right way to find what you're looking for i.e type of restauarant or shop. Overall security and immigration operations are very disorganised. Staff members are rude throughout the entire process. Avoid this airport if you can and go to one that values your custom and wants to provide you with a good experience.,-1,JFK

Immigration in T4 went well through electronic terminals. Security in T4 was reasonably fast, but the staff were extremely rude. I was selected for a full body scan, I did not realise I still had my boarding pass from LHR in a pocket and the operative screamed at me 'I told you take everything out of your pockets'. I had been picked for a random full search Heathrow and the staff were a model of courtesy and politeness, JFK could learn a lot of lessons from them on how to do it. The transfer Jitney from T4 to T2 is dismal, poor signage and totally disinterested staff and filthy old bus. T4 must be one of the most depressing terminals I have had the misfortune to visit. When you enter you are hit by a wall of hot oil cooking smells from the fast food outlets. The access into the Delta Skyclub is up a staircase in front of a fast food outlet, through a cloud oil fumes. The lounge smelt just as bad.",-1,JFK

",False,  While on layover at JFK my daughter and I had a 5 hour flight delay. She is a celiac and must eat gluten free. There are no restaurants with allergen menus. The Asian restaurant in our concourse didn't even have gluten free soy sauce which is a common item. After traveling through Ireland and finding gluten free options available in most of the villages and in all restaurant in large cities I find it appalling that an international airport wouldn't require their restaurants to have a few gluten free offerings. For my daughter this is not a choice but a medical necessity. We had no problems other than that.,1,JFK

One CBP Officer for about 400 arrivals. When I asked why I was informed it was shift hand-over time. Two and a half hours later three more CBP Officers arrived which must be the longest shift hand-over anywhere in the world. During that time no public announcements were made despite elderly and young suffering in the heat without water and no seating. Not sure if the CBP Management are incompetent, inefficient, disinterested or just lack the basic understanding of supply and demand concepts.

I requested a patdown and had to wait around 15 minutes for a TSA agent to do that. He told me in advance how he intended to search me and went on to do just that. The examination felt a little rougher than it did the last time I received a patdown five years ago. This was probably the TSA's enhanced patdowns that were implemented in 2017. Also, since my belongings were separated into four bins, the agent stacked the bins on top of each other without regard for their contents. So my heavy backpack was stacked on top of my laptop.

We were left wandering up and down this hostile environment with nobody willing to offer us help as we faced a night with nowhere to sleep, due to hotel rooms being completely full. What on earth happened to security? Even on these grounds, nobody stopped us.

Following an excellent flight with British Airways, my family of 11 and I arrived at JFK airport, in order to get our connecting flights to Orlando. We were looking forward to our 2 week holiday. Unfortunately, our flight was cancelled due to an electrical storm, we believe. We were directed from one end of the airport to the other, trying to find a resolution. We were met with disdain and utter rudeness. We were not even offered a glass of water, never mind a hotel accommodation. My family and I had to go through security on 3 occasions, we had to grab some sleep on the floor. Nobody helped us. We were horrified by the lack of support we received from the great USA. You would think that 11 people wondering up and down the airport would have attracted some attention? We lost a day of our holidays and we would never recommend travelling via JFK to anyone.

Extremely off putting experience, this airport has implemented new technology but it has not successfully reduced wait times or enhanced customer experience.

JFK air traffic control had us sitting on tarmac for 5 hours. Sending pilot mixed messages every 15 mins, babies crying, people needing to use the restroom but couldn’t get up because we were techically waiting to depart. Our plane was behind 38 others to depart. The weather was fine when we boarded but turned severe around hour 3. As a result we missed our connection and had to spend 53 hours in air and other airports to get to Africa. None of our seat purchase upgrades were honored and we missed the first day of our tour. Also was sitting on tarmac with earlier flight for an hour. JFK air traffic control manages inbound and outbound flights poorly. If you can avoid this airport please do.",-1,JFK

I think the two most galling aspects of TSA generally are a complete lack of urgency, unless they are shouting instructions at visitors and a propensity to have casual conversations amongst themselves. I appreciate that security is important but the collection of taxes on air tickets should mean that all these waiting passengers should be providing sufficient revenue to staff the booths adequately. More generally, I think the term ""customer"" has lost its meaning in many aspects of air travel. It's now often synonymous with ""inconvenience"".",-1,JFK

They canceled our flights yesterday due to bad weather even though skies were clear in both my departure and arrival cities. I believe the airport does this on purpose so that they can price gouge for the surrounding rental cars and hotels. The rental car place expressed to me that it is supply and demand and that when the airport does that they raise their rates accordingly because they know people will still rent I believe that is unacceptable and should be illegal for price gouging.

I explained to her that my wife was walking to the car and I could see her and the woman still made me drive around the loop and come back. When I couldn't pull away from the curb because I was blocked in, she asked me if I thought she looked stupid and if I knew how to drive a car. Just a terrible woman with a terrible attitude.

I have given up on Miami because the immigration make it so hard for all passengers coming from Latin Countries, although I carry an Australian passport and am 77 years old. LAX is too difficult for elderly passengers with horrific waits at immigration and ditto Atlanta. I decided some years ago to use JFK for arrival normally in Terminals 4 or 5 and then to exit normally with an Asian 5 star airline. Never again! The arrivals by JetBlue are disastrous now with gates not available and immigration waits of more than 2 hours. At Terminal 7 all but American passengers waited for 150 minutes plus to be processed from an ANA flight from Tokyo But now even the departures are disasters with waits of more than 2 hours on the tarmac quite regular and in my case in June more than 5 hours. Why are the USA airports so bad for non Americans and why are the elderly treated so badly?

At the security point, after passing the scanner, I was asked to go on the side where I was asked to empty my pockets. I had an empty plastic SIM card holder and a few paper tissues still in my pockets, as I didn’t know we have to fully empty our pockets. I assumed we just need to get rid of the metal. The officer asked ""You didn't know you have to get everything out of your pockets?"" to which I replied ""No"". He then told me I have to be thoroughly checked and explained that meant feeling up my legs thoroughly. After providing a brief explanation, this is what the officer did, in presence of his supervisor. Also, the officer examined my hand palms with what I presume is a drug detector. In that moment I was too intimidated to ask why all this was necessary as the officer was loud and, also, I was afraid of a potential delay with proceeding to my gate. So, I simply agreed and asked nothing. It is not clear to me why such a thorough check-up was necessary. Why I wasn’t simply allowed to go back through the scanner after taking out the SIM card plastic holder and my tissues is beyond me.",-1,JFK

I flew out of Terminal 4 on Delta and returned through Terminal 1 (having flown in on Alitalia). Absolutely no problems either way. I was able to print out my departure boarding pass from a machine and did not even have to go to the airline counter. I received a TSA pre-check on my departure and that made the security walk through a breeze. Terminal 4 has lots of shops and quite a few restaurants. They provide a full range of choices in products, services, and prices. The Delta flight departure was very well organized with agents ensuring boarding groups were kept separated. Announcements were made in a timely manner and the plane pushed back on time. The terminal was busy but clean and it had all the excitement of planes departing to all corners of the globe. Signs were ample and self-explanatory. I had the fastest exit in my life after arriving in Terminal 1. At 4 pm, the arriving area had no passengers from other flights. I used the machine to have my passport read and presented the slip to the agent at the exit gate along with the passport. He waved me through. There were many such machines. Having no checked luggage, I briskly walked out and made my way across the terminal to the Sky Train which for 5 US dollars connected me to the main train system of New York City.

2018-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,4.5 hours to get through immigration,False," For a city that professes to be the ""best in the world"" I can only say that my experience at JFK was an omen of what was to come. I hated the cynical, money grabbing nature of the city but the airport was just beyond awful. Arrived at 16:30 expecting to be in and out of immigration in an hour. Immigration hall was packed to the rafters with people off previous flights. No desks were open and there was just one staff member wandering about looking bored and not acknowledging anyone. A sign above stated waiting time was 90 minutes, which bearing in mind the amount of people waiting to go through was a bit of a stretch I thought. 2 hours later, one desk opens and we were shuttled like sheep through a maze of queues. Kids were crying, people were sat on the floor, an old couple constantly appealed to the one security guard as to why more gates were not open, only to be stared at with no response. Rude beyond belief. The heat was awful, there must have been 600 or more people queuing. After 3 hours one more gate was open so the queue started to flow a little quicker, but again, by now people were becoming fractious. Another two plane loads arrive making the heat unbearable and space at a minimum. There were no chairs to sit or places to buy water. Eventually at 9 oclock, 4.5 hours later we got through the immigration queue. I cannot describe what an ordeal it was. The staff were rude, unresponsive, gave no explanation or apology for the interminable wait, and cared not for the distress suffered by the young and old. We arrived at our hotel at 11 at night. A whole evening wasted in that damned hell hole. I have spoken with others who confirmed that this is about normal for JFK. So if you can find another means of getting into the city, do so, try another airport, because this was positively third rate treatment. Disgusted!",-1,JFK

2018-06-10,0.2,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,A dismal experience,False,"  A dismal experience (again). For as long as I can remember, there have been ‘improvements’ going on at terminal 7 but nothing improves. The seating is insufficient, the layout inefficient and the (few) food outlets terrible. No one would chose to fly from here if they did not have to. In the main restaurant, I ordered a salad which never arrived so I had to leave without eating as the flight departure time was approaching. I bought a sandwich in the shop - it must have been in the fridge for 12 hours - it was inedible. British Airways has its own problems more generally but having to depart from here does not help its corporate image. This terminal is a terrible indictment of the generally poor quality of airport infrastructure in the US.",-1,JFK

",False,"  One of my worst airports experiences. TSA agents were rude and inefficient, nearly loose my connection. TSA agents kept on placing people who arrived later ahead of us on the que. Their procedures were unnecessarily slow. I had shaving cream in excess of allowance I guess, (no problems with same baggage in two checkpoints in Europe). It took them more than 15 min to check the bags, and confiscate the item. The TSA staff kept on talking, to her co-workers, I am hard of hearing. I did not know when she was giving me commands, then scolded me for not following her orders.",-1,JFK

One would think that a highly rated world city like this would come with the appropriate airport, but it was exactly the opposite. My most shocking experience though was with the immigration/customs officers at the airport. Most of them were rude, unwelcoming and treated people in very derogatory ways. I do not know what training these people undergo in the U.S. to take on these positions, but certainly good manners and politeness ate not in their curriculum.

Arrived from LGW to huge queues in immigration, no organisation, fights breaking out because some got to jump the queue and staff barking orders at us. 2hrs to go through then collect bags. Departing a few weeks later from T1 was even worse, from the very rude check-in agent to the rugby scrum at security, agents shouting at passengers like they were stupid and it was obvious wearing a uniform puts them on a power trip. Dirty airport, toilets disgusting, Alitalia lounge agent didn’t say a word to us as we presented our passes completely blanked us. Lounge dirty, overcrowded, stale food and a horrible experience.

Travellers couldn’t fit in the immigration hall they were almost queuing to get in the hall. We were lucky, we got through in 2 hours, other people waited 6 hours. A couple in front of us booked a limousine transfer from the airport but it had to leave without them, it understandably couldn’t wait in excess of 2 hours. Our luggage was left standing at the side of the baggage belt unattended for over 2 hours. There’s no drink facilities, no seats for the elderly, signage is misleading (current queue time in excess of 1 hour - it should say the actual time, I.e 6 hours). What a poor show NY.

While it is understandable that there are a myriad of travelers that they are responsible for screening, it does not excuse their behavior toward those traveling, especially the elderly and handicapped. They have no common sense and empathy toward the people who need help when travelling.

",False,"  This airport sure has a way of getting you in a bad mood. Many TSA and border agents are rude and untactful, and if they're not, it's just plain disorganization, but on my last trip, the immigration staff managed to be rude and insulting both flying out and back (in transit). The first time, my wife, who has two passports, was unsure as to which passport to use. I won't go into details, but it was in complete good faith, but still an immigration officer told her arrogantly that she was ""playing with identities"" and to me, when I tried to explain the reasons, he asked aggressively how much I knew about migration law. Then, on the way back, another officer, having learned that we live in the DR, absentmindedly said ""and I thought this was a bad place"", right out of thin air. My other encounters with this airport have been better, but not exactly great.",-1,JFK

There is no terminal at JFK without its flaws. Departures at Terminal One is somewhat decent, but the arrivals there is by far the worst. Terminal Four is a disgusting mess, and the rest are all horrible as well. To start, the staff at JFK are some of the rudest people I have ever met in my life. Just walking through the terminal you get looks from them, when you ask for help they're condescending, they bark orders at you instead of using a basic human being's tone. The airport is also disgusting. The bathrooms are not clean, some of the seats in the terminal or at gates will be wet or sticky, it's truly disgusting. The airport is also very confusing, gates are not clearly marked, nor where to find them. There are very few boards throughout the terminal. All staff at restaurants or food concessions are rude, or mess up your order, or are clueless. Flights at JFK are frequently delayed, and planes take forever to get to the gate which I can't seem to find a reason as to why that would be the airline's fault. The wifi at the airport also doesn't work at all, and better yet they don't seem to get any kind of cell service there (I've jumped around carriers and have always had the same issue). The security at the airport is a whole other animal. These people assume every person in line is guilty and will not hesitate to yell at you. The people at customs as well love to harass. The lounges at JFK also seem to be lacking. All New York area airports are lacking, but JFK really seems to be the worst.",-1,JFK

Lady shouting orders at us then tutting at us as if we were idiots as I handed her all passports together. She kissed her lips saying, 'jeez you should know it’s one at a time' then proceeded to shout at us to move quicker down the line. Rudest person I have ever met, JFK.

2018-04-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,lots of seating and bathrooms,True," As a frequent user of this airport, I am surprised by the generally negative reviews it gets. I mostly use Terminal 8 - tenants include American Airlines and several One World members - and have found it to be modern, spacious, with lots of seating and bathrooms, along with shops and eateries, and clean and tidy too! My recent trip through terminal 8 was no exception. True, the TSA staff often do not exude charm but they keep the lines moving through the security machines. On departure, I used the Admirals lounge - it offers nice views of the taxiways through large windows and a good selection of hard and soft drinks. More attention needs to be given to keep the food areas tidy, but more importantly, ensure the food trays have food on them! I returned from Canada and with US immigration done at point of departure, arrival at and exit out of the airport could not be faster or easier. Reviews on this site suggest that the experience varies across terminals and thus broad generalization about JFK may overlook many positive aspects of the airport including its easy access by public transportation.",1,JFK
2018-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,signage was wrong or non-existent,True," After a 15 hour flight from Doha (and with connections to CA) I was stunned by the disorganization, wait-time and general chaos while re-entering the US today (March 31, 2018). The signage was wrong or non-existent, US Citizens are thrown into the same “lines” as non-citizens and there are far too few Officials to establish a semblance of order. The “Passport & Immigrantion” touch screens are temperamental and require multiple attempts to advance in order to procure the coveted ‘receipt’. One beleaguered red-coated employee said this was the ‘new normal’ as staffing was insufficient. That is clearly part of the problem, but the whole ‘process’ is highly problematic. We waited well over an hour to pass through and nearly missed our connection — with many others waiting much longer. And as we all stood there like cattle, it was impossible to get WiFi. One helpful fellow recommended downloading the Mobile Passport App in the future - but this doesn’t help visitors who were as distressed and annoyed as those of us who are citizens.",-1,JFK

There is no distinction between US Citizens and foreigners who all are forced to stand and wait in the same lines. The red jacketed attendant stupidly replied to me that this was a better system, that the signs for USCitizens did not mean anything, and that no one was superior with this system. This insulted me for several reasons. 1) All foreign destinations have lines for citizens and another line for non-citizens. The citizens lines tend to move rapidly. 2) I am a Vietnam Vet, a US Citizen, a taxpayer and feel we should have priority entering our own country. As it was, we waited in line for 2 hours, and after the fingerprint scanner failed, the Officer simply got up from his desk, closed the door and walked off the floor. If this was a private business, he would have been fired.",-1,JFK
2018-03-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,TSA rude and unhelpful,False," TSA rude and unhelpful. Barking orders as loudly as possible and all the time the same orders as though it was a meat processing plant. We were told we were TSA Approved and it was on our pass for boarding - we were told to tell the staff member which we did. It seemed to make them want to search for a problem even more. They ridiculed my plastic boots given to all passengers in Madrid to keep their feet or socks clean when they remove shoes, and they were so rude and told me it was not acceptable after I had cleared the machine - shoes removed because of big heals. There was zero in my tiny case other than clothes but they held it back and kept it for so long another passenger intervened and told them to give it to me, and they had just left it sitting behind the the x ray box and had not done anything with it after the screening there! They then proceeded to try to close it and were catching the clothes in the zipper which seemed to amuse the man doing it. We asked for it back to close ourselves, before something was torn. This is about the third trip through this airport and we will never return to the airports [or city]. The flight to Seattle from Virgin was delayed three times and the the third time it was then backtracked upon and we were told - by a soft human voice and no inter-com it was ""going right now"". By then many people had walked right away from the gate to fill the three hours projected wait from the last delay: somewhere other than the boring gate area. People crowded around frantic to get on, and there was only an elderly staff member half directing who was boarding in a quiet voice with no inter-com. It was a total gong show, unbelievable. No cabin staff around other than at the door, and suitcases being stuffed into bins overhead where half would literally not fit! Swap out most of the staff to Seatac for two weeks and show them some manners and common sense tactics. Maybe La Guardia is better?? NJ certainly is not! I am a well travelled 72 year old, and this airport is the worst of the worst. Pay staff properly and get some fresh faces, not control freaks!",-1,JFK

Once I got into the customs hall reality hit - 1.5 hours waiting in line with hundreds maybe even thousands of other passengers to get processed.

I hardly managed to catch my flight because of long queues, and because instead of following the signs and going into separate lines, all of us had to go in one line. Machines are not working properly, there is no one to show you what to do, and when you finally fight your way through crazed passengers and arrive to the officer in charge who will check your passport, you get a terrible treatment. Unfortunately, no one will care about all these negative reviews and about all our frustrations, until we all stop flying to and via NYC. Considering the number of people in the world, this will never happen, but I sincerely hope that someone will make a big deal out of it, someone important who will be treated like this and put a stop to all incompetent and miserable people who work there.

I am not sure why, but the staff here think they are far superior to any passenger! We were treated terribly on arrival to the airport, with staff either ignoring us when we asked questions about which ESTA lane to join or they simply shouted their robotic “all first time ESTAs this way” in our faces. Both of us had been to the USA previously, so we joined the “returning ESTA” line, but apparently if you haven’t been within the last 2 years you have to join the “first time ESTA” line? Had the rude staff member we approached explained this it would have been quite simple. Then on departure the man at security was simply inhuman. Screeming at people to step inside a security screen and then barking orders like “don’t you dare move a muscle”, “are you blind?”. I understand the need for strict security with all that has happened in recent years, and I can appreciate the need for staff to be formal and professional, but that is not what this was. There was a complete disregard for maintaining the respect and dignity of passengers. There is absolutely no need to speak to people in such a manner, these people need to be taught some manners and get off their high horses. I won’t be flying into America again for this reason. I’d rather explore all of the other wonderful places in the world that treat other people with dignity and respect. The cleanliness of the airport was also an issue. With smelly toilets that were consistently out of loo paper and sticky seats and tables.",-1,JFK

Each visit the process of going through immigration and security gets worse. On arrival from Heathrow it was clear to some of the staff at JFK that a few of us weren't sure where we had to go. When we approached staff we were either ignored, tutted at or laughed at. One member of staff was sniggering at a family struggling to use the self check in machines. It was chaotic. However at the end of our trip when we returned to JFK well what can I say. TSA service was disgusting. The only thing missing was a cattle prod. Shouting orders, humiliating people, talking to us like we were animals. I have never in my life experienced another human being talking to any member of the public like this. There was no need for it. Many people were visibly upset and uncomfortable. It upset myself and my daughter. I will never ever return to America again. It has totally put me off forever. I would also recommend friends and family to avoid JFK at all costs. That is unless they want to be treated like a prisoner. It was so nice to get home to Britain.",-1,JFK

This is the first tsa checkpoint I have encountered with the most rude and unprofessional personnel in my thirty years of traveling around the world. The superiors of the tsa personnel need to go under cover and see for themselves what a nightmare JFK airport really is. The tsa employees were inconsiderate, rude, and words cannot describe their unprofessionalism. Not only was my family affected by their actions, but everyone in the same line.

The booking allowed for 3.5 hours between flights which we assumed would be sufficient. In fairness to the airport there had been heavy snow the day before but when we arrived and went to baggage reclaim, it took 2 hours for the bags to come through, my bag came through on a different carousel! It was sheer luck I overheard another passenger telling someone that I found my bag at all. We deposited them with the Baggage Transfer Desk and ran to catch our flight which was, fortunately for us, delayed anyway. The staff there were surly, unhelpful and rude, no appreciation of our dilemma at all. We arrived at Cancun to find out our baggage had not arrived and in fact it took 3 days to turn up, we were very stressed and ended up having to go shopping for clothes and other items which we could barely fit in our luggage. On our return, everything ran very smoothly, arrived in time, quickly retrieved our luggage, passed it to Baggage Transfer and got on our flight without any problems back to Heathrow. Unbelievably only one of our bags turned up, we are still waiting for the other one which was delayed for reasons unknown in JFK. I will never ever go via this airport again, I will either find another route or not bother than go through this misery.

I arrived from Cairo and left a 3.5 hour transit time. The immigration queues are massive and once you pass immigration you have go to baggage claim. You need to buy a trolley for $6, god help you if you manage to find one, let alone if you don't have dollars. Unfortunately the airport staff are not helpful and aggressive and make you feel you are not to approach or bother them. In transit you need to claim baggage first if you arrival in terminal 4, its chaotic getting out and trying to find your terminal departure or connecting flight - very crowded. I would honestly try to plan to avoid arriving in JFK. The departure hall in terminal 4 is really nice with a lot of amenities and services, if you have the luxury of time, however even with a 3.5 hour transit time I thought that was enough, I was wrong.",-1,JFK

It was a horrible experience! First we kept getting delayed because of the plane leaving JFK to get to us. 5 hour delay which cost us an extra $150 in lunch and drinks at the airport for four of us. We finally board, and land at JFK only to be told we don't have a gate! Sat there for almost 3 hours, pull up to a gate and no one to direct the pilot all the way in. 15 min wait for that! So glad that we didn't have bags checked in! I'm now sick because of being up for 24 hours. My youngest son had to drive back to college that same day. Should have been home by 9.30 Saturday night instead of 5.30 am Sunday. Felt bad for the flight crew, they were completely spent from being on the previous flight also. No excuse for an airport of this magnitude!",-1,JFK

Every member of staff I came into contact with was disinterested in their tasks, rude, careless and irritated. At customs I was shouted at by members of staff and when making a mistake with which way to line up I was humiliated by staff who laughed at me and questioned me in the most patronising way about why I had gone one way and not another. Once through customs I burst into tears after such an unnecessary and upsetting ordeal. The staff at JFK are absolutely the rudest people I have ever met. I cannot understand why they are allowed to behave like that. I will avoid this airport at all costs in future and will be reluctant to visit NYC. Disgraceful. Manners are free, a smile is easier than a frown and belittling others is not an acceptable form of ‘crowd control’. Playground bullies.",-1,JFK

When we finally unboarded at 3.30 am the airplane, we went to immigration where we encountered a severely overcrowded area with passengers and under staffed by immigration officers trying to cope, that took us about 2 hours more.

The staff at the departure gates, (flight no EI0108, December 6 at 21.10) were downright rude! I can’t understand why these people work with the public, they have no people skills whatsoever. They were very obviously never taught any manners or customer service skills and they must have no one supervising them.The way they spoke at (yes spoke at, not to) people queuing up made my blood boil and I could see a number of people extremely annoyed by their behaviour.

On arrival I was in a wheelchair and was shouted at because it seemed the hand scanner was not successful in scanning my hand, after 3 attempts he shouted, 'What have you got on your hands'. What can you say. I didn't know why it didn't work. He tried again, still nothing. So then he starts shouting at me to go to a different scanner. It appeared it was all my fault that it didn't work. The second scanner was successful on the second attempt. It was all done in a horrible uncaring manner and I have to say I was beginning to regret traveling to New York at all. The immigration official was so miserable and rude I felt I was totally not welcome in the country. When leaving New York it was even worse. I was in a wheelchair again and was shouted at to go this way and that way. I then underwent an intensive search in public. The wheelchair was scanned and that belonged to the airport. When he was finished I was told that I was sitting in the wheelchair with my legs apart and that looked suspicious. I suppose that and the fact that my body was shaking because I have Parkinson's made me a potential criminal at 73 years old. I wouldn't have minded so much if they didn't talk to me as if I was already guilty commiting a crime. They are rude, unsympathetic and downright nasty without cause and I will not be going back there again.",-1,JFK

There is nobody giving directions on getting through security check. Most airports have you take off your shoes, place coats on belt, etc. Not JFK. They make their own rules.

Besides the expected hour long wait on the runway before take off, that every flight experiences, the terminal is a nightmare. TSA employees are always very unprofessional. The person who takes your ticket at a movie theater behaves better than these people. The employees at the resturausnts would rather you ""go over there"" for food, instead of you sitting at their restaurant. Food is terrible, atmosphere is terrible, people are miserable, WiFi never works right. Next time I fly to DC, I am absolutely going to fly through either ATL or DET.

It is dirty, and very third world - it is an embarrassment for such a major city. All the airport staff are horrible and incredibly rude.

A complete lack of seating is available which is not helpful at all when travelling with elderly relatives. There were no customer assistants or staff to direct or help. The air con was broken or does not exist but the temperature was far too hot and unacceptable. The wandering tiki was over run with people due to lack of seating in the terminal or at the gates. Just trying to get a drink was an ordeal in itself. The staff however were friendly but evidently unable to keep up with demand. The long island brew house was put of action however even with this I do not feel this would have helped the seating situation. People were literally laying all over the floor. I can guarantee I will be paying extra to fly in and out of Newark.,-1,JFK

",False,"  Worst airport ever. As an American, I feel ashamed that there are people from other nationalities coming and going from this airport daily and experiencing the downright dehumanizing rudeness from its employees. Despite just getting off an 11 hour flight and a three hour one before that, I was in a good mood, until I arrived here. The immigration line was long and horrible when arriving. The place is filthy and the food selections are downright terrible. When I checked my luggage in, the clerk was extremely rude straight away and acted bothered by nothing. TSA both coming and going were unprofessional with horrible attitudes whose only real profession seemed to be making snide comments for extremely petty reasons. Everywhere I went there were long lines of people being herded along like cattle by some rude staff member. I have to wonder, is it in these people's job descriptions to be blatantly rude? I will do what I need to never use this airport again, even if that means paying more for a ticket elsewhere.",-1,JFK

Myself and my daughter were shouted at for walking to the wrong line, a line that another employee had told us to join. This is what she shouted verbatim - 'Hello maam, Hello am I not here? Are you blind? Are you just going to ignore my instruction?' To which I replied of course not, it was obvious that she wasn't interested in what her colleague has said.

The CBP clearance during arrival was very chaotic. Officers/personnel pointing you in the wrong direction. The baggage was taken from the belt and put together on the ground due to a lack of sufficient amounts of reclaim belts. Departure was smooth. No long waiting times in the DL Priority area, curbside very crowded. TSA not that bad, only 10 mins or so. But the waiting areas around the gates were very crowded. I was happy that I was able to acces the DL Skyclub to avoid all those people and crying children. Duty-free very overpriced and limited shopping.",1,JFK

They literally bark at you, offering no assistance if you look like you're struggling. My husband forgot his wedding ring after leaving security, when he went back to get it the TSA officer was disgustingly rude. My husband is not one to back down so he gave him a piece of his mind.

Once I arrived at customs there were two very long lines. Since I was a US citizen, I was able to get on the shorter line. I had to use electronic kiosks and then was redirected to a long line. But luckily, there were plenty Customs Officers on duty so I was able to get through in about 20 minutes. Baggage claim wasn't too bad and taxi dispatch got me a taxi really quickly.",1,JFK

Very inefficient system of scattered scanners, people having difficulty and staff refusing to help people. Then you wait in a disorganized line for customs control. Asked me if I brought anything and I replied that I didn't bring food whereby he rudely lashed out ""that's not what I asked you"". This is no way to be welcomed back to the United States regardless of being citizen or not. We are supposed to be a leader in technology and friendly country yet first impressions by every face I saw was one of misery, fear of complaining and disappointment.

2017-08-24,0.6,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,,3.0,3.0,I must have entered another dimension,False,"  I arrived at JFK for the first time in four years in June 2017. The immigration checkpoint had changed by then, with everyone required to scan his/her passport at a computer kiosk. Fortunately, an airport employee was nice enough to show me where to stand to take my picture. The Homeland Security official who checked my passport and customs declaration form (6059B) didn't stamp it. After retrieving my luggage and queuing up to submit the 6059B, an armed customs officer brusquely asked me why I'd gotten in line. I told him that I was waiting to submit the form and he rhetorically asked if he'd told me to get in line. So I left the queue and exited the terminal. Thankfully, that was the only bad treatment I got at JFK during this trip. Two months later, when I departed New York, security at its Terminal 1 was surprisingly streamlined. TSA didn't require passengers to take off their shoes, produce their laptops, or receive a body scan/patdown. I must have entered another dimension.",1,JFK

They were shouting (barking) orders at the people on the line as if they were drill sergeants. If someone left something in his or her pocket they insulted him and yelled that he's holding up the line. When someone is screaming at you at the top of his lungs, it's hard to comprehend and follow his instructions. I have been to airports all over the world and do occasionally make a mistake. I have found that everywhere else, the agents are polite and usually friendly. These people need serious retraining and should be let go if they can't behave like humans.",-1,JFK

I don't fly often so I was not familiar with the kiosk check in. It asked for my confirmation number, I did not know where to find it on my voucher (it was called something different on the voucher) so I asked a floor staff member for help. I asked how to use the kiosk and she replied, ""what's hard about it? Do you know how to read? All you have to do is read!"" Her tone was demeaning and she kept walking as she was speaking to me. TSA agents were basically rude robots getting easily frustrated over nothing. Even the lady working at the small convenience store near gate #32 was extremely rude when a price was not clear on an item. I was in a good mood before I got to this place.",-1,JFK

On the outbound journey, the security check lines were long but moved rapidly. The terminal is used by a large number of airlines. It has a good collection of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia lounge was spacious and airy with a good selection of self servings of finger food and drinks including beer from Italy. It also offered free wifi and an announcement was made when our flight was ready to board. On return, we used the automatic kiosks for our passports. The exit was a breeze. The officers were pleasant and we were out of the terminal in no time. In sum, it was a hitch free experience considering the number of passengers and flights that as handled by this terminal.",1,JFK

Several of them were shamelessly shouting at passengers undergoing security screening. Others simply didn't deign to speak to passengers. My partner was retrieving his things after they had been scanned, and he was apparently in one officer's way. Instead of saying ""excuse me"" like a decent person, she stood directly behind him until he noticed her, and then she made the ""shoo"" hand gesture at him. From one adult to another! It's honestly appalling. Additionally, Terminal 7 doesn't have enough seating, and I have located exactly six outlets (that work - I found two others that did not work) in the Gates 1-6 section.

Less than 50 feet later, we were told we couldn't take the cart in. That is absolutely wrong! There was no sign saying that you couldn't take it.

I sat and watched as the cleaner moved 3 customers who were in the middle of their meals so he could rearrange the tables. I then tried to get a coffee in the only coffee shop open in the entire terminal (it's 9.47 pm) only to be told they wouldn't serve me because they are closing, in 15 minutes.

We joined the conga line in about 300th place and the queue did not move for ages. Looking around I could see 2 officers in booths. This is ridiculous, by now the line had extended to crazy proportions and there must have been 1500 people some with very young children crying through tiredness and hunger. We were given no reason for this delay and were not given any water at all. It took us nearly 4hrs from plane to leaving. I think this needs looking at very seriously.

But after my recent trip to New York, passing through JFK, I am left feeling saddened by my observation that something has gone very wrong with this airports ability to provide a decent level of customer service. My arrival process involved myself and other customers being left standing in a line, not moving, for a considerable length of time, looking at empty immigration desks. Also the self service pass port check machines were not available. No explanation or apology was made for a very obvious problem. Some public announcement was made, worded in a way that only airport staff could understand, immigration officers made their way to their desks, we were then processed reasonably quickly. It was during my departure when I experienced similar issues already explained in other bad reviews for this airport, regarding security staff. I am left disgusted by the total lack of professionalism and any kind of courtesy or respect from your staff during the security process. I shared my concern with a member of staff at the Information Desk (with the understanding that it was not within her jurisdiction) who's response made it clear to me that she felt I was overreacting. I am left feeling that the management of JFK Airport have no understanding or just don't care that their airport staff are giving their customers such a vile experience.

I arrive shortly before 6am and see a long security line so I realize I am unlikely to make my flight. It's my fault so I realize I have to accept my fate. But once they scanned my ticket, a TSA worker asks who is boarding the flight. I raise my hand and they make sure I get through the security line and tell me to run towards the gate. I run to the gate with my bag and the airline staff usher me on board, as I'm the last to arrive before the doors close. I am so thankful I made my flight! JFK gets some poor reviews and I've had less than stellar experiences there but this one restores my faith in JFK staff.

There is no real method to lining up to go through security it just seems like a mess. They keep telling you not to block the areas but there is nowhere for people to go. Immigration is a shambles, the machines are good but again there is no real methodology to lining up. It says go to a machine when the lights are green but there are about 100 machines, half of which you can't see from the line. I was at gate C68 and assumed I had plenty of time when I followed the signs but no, without warning it told me I had to take a shuttle bus to another terminal. Why not say that like other airports e.g. time from here to gate -- then people know where they are and how much time they have - simple. Luckily though I did have enough time due to the airports sheer incompetence. As I write this I am still sitting on the plane after 2.5 hours waiting to be de-iced. I mean who would ever think that it snows in New York in January? If only we could forecast these things and maybe get more than one hairdryer to de-ice 125 planes!

2016-10-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,we were held for two and a half hours,False,  Interestingly we went through on same date as a previous reviewer. We arrived at terminal 4 on 24th September. Having been through the British Airways terminal a number of years ago you are not prepared for your treatment at terminal 4. We are currently appealing a no show on our taxi company as we were held for two and a half hours through security. My only regret is that I did not ask for the person's ID and name as he was enjoying every minute of the delay he was causing. Can I suggest you get rid of all the people controlling the queues saving that expense in favour of a light and bell system where you are called individually by the desk operator then you don't get the situation we all had which was being directed by a staff member at the head of the main queue to desks where there were already queues and being stuck. Our operator then delighted in closing two desks either side where people were queuing and asking us to merge into one. He then got a query and went off to seek advice delaying it even further. Whilst I think we all appreciate the vigilance we also travelled recently through Paris CDG and London Heathrow both experiencing the same security issues as the US but without the grief experienced in your country. Further to my suggestion of a bell and lighting system perhaps the government could seek advice from every major bank or retailer who operates these systems very efficiently. Interestingly when departing terminal 4 two week later nothing was complicated.,-1,JFK

2016-09-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,horrible experience,False,"  Paris to New York and vice versa through JFK. Horrible experience. The treatment from most of the airport staff was quite degrading. In a previous comment somebody mentioned that, when going through security check, a woman was yelling 'they aint gonna load emselves' to the people so that they put their bags/items onto the conveyor. That is exactly what I heard too. I mean, what are we? Animals? Passport control was even worse. There was a woman there, looking completely unprofessional, that was yelling incoherently to the people to go where she was pointing at. At first, when I was still a bit farther away, I thought it was some crazy person and the security would pick her up, but it was indeed airport staff. Finally, I would imagine that the main airport for one of the biggest cities in the world would be spacious, but far from it; narrow corridors and a general claustrophobic environment.",-1,JFK

2016-08-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,staff loud and rude,False," On arrival at New York JFK we were separated into queues - one for US citizens and one for foreigners. It took over an hour just to reach the ESTA machines. Due to poor signage, we asked what we should do with our little printouts from the machines and were directed along a corridor. Seconds later we were bellowed at by someone asking us to get back in the line. We explained that we'd been sent through but to no avail. We then collected our baggage and then we queued up to leave the airport and give another rude and sullen employee our stamped ticket. Altogether we had waited almost 2 hours. The taxi queue outside was unbelievable. Not due to lack of taxis but to the traffic chaos outside. Everyone for arrivals and departures are at the same place. Cars, buses, taxis with lanes constantly blocked by people stopping wherever they felt like it to unload / load etc. An employee ran up and down, yelling and blowing a whistle to keep the traffic moving. Nowhere is adequately signed e.g. Stand A, B etc. There is just one sign - Passenger Pick up and Drop off. I assume this means along the whole length of the airport. Hence no-one knows where exactly to wait. Everyone asked everyone else what to do. It was absolute chaos. In the queue for the taxi passengers further down were always trying to cut in but after an hour and a half wait, I couldn't blame them. From leaving the plane to getting a taxi took 3.5 hours. Overall the airport is poorly signed, with most monitors showing advertising instead of information. It is a challenge to find the toilets. Seating is limited and the whole atmosphere is stressful and unwelcoming. As for the airport staff - loud and rude is all that I can say. Never again, not even with a connecting flight.",-1,JFK
2016-08-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,staff were rude and unhelpful,False,"  International arrival at JFK Terminal 7, transfer to a domestic flight - Terminal 8. JFK is the worst airport I have ever used, and I've used many. It is almost impossible to make a 3 hour layover as the lines to immigration go forever. You get out of the plane and the line starts already at gate entrance. There is no information what this line was for or what is going on. The only spoken announcements were initially in Spanish. Staff were rude and unhelpful. Took 2 hours to clear immigration, then 30 minutes to check in for the next flight. You need to claim your luggage before transfer. Made it only because my next flight was first delayed, then cancelled - something that happens frequently at JFK. My advice - if you can, use a different airport for your arrival into the US.",-1,JFK
2016-08-19,0.9,Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"a good, convenient to use airport",False," 
Considering it is an old airport and among the busiest ones in the world JFK is a good, convenient to use airport. When we landed there it was easy to get through passports (friendly staff) and suitcases arrived quickly. Taxis and transport to the city are easy to find. Departing was also easy with small ques and fast but efficient security control. Not the biggest variety of shops but good enough to spend some time. All in all a good experience.",1,JFK
2016-08-03,0.7,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,not built for the A380,False,"  I flew with a group of my students to New York on a field trip. The last day, the pilots of Lufthansa went on strike. We got to JFK very early to make sure that we were rebooked on a different flight. The airline put us together on the SIA flight to Frankfurt. We had to change terminals going from 1 to 4 with all of our luggage and 5 teenagers who just lost their final day in NYC. After standing in line for more than 1.5 hours, we had to stand in line again for more than 2 hours. By the time we had checked-in, there was no going back to Manhattan. We passed security and hoped for the best. The typical food stands, Starbucks and Shake-a-Shack available. Most of the time they were bored to tears - so my advice, if you travel with boys between 15 and 18 do not get to JFK 4 hours prior departure. JFK has not been built for the A380 and the number of passengers. It is difficult to find available seating at their departure gates and this has happened to me with both LH and SIA.",1,JFK

I was in a complete panic after losing my cell phone at the airport. With no way to contact my family and let them know when I’d be arriving, I was extremely stressed and worried that they’d be concerned about me. Hillary noticed my distress and went above and beyond by offering to let me use her personal phone to send a quick text to my family. Her kindness, thoughtfulness, and willingness to help me in a moment of crisis made all the difference. Thanks to her, I was able to let my family know when to pick me up, and I could finally breathe a sigh of relief. Never did find my phone but there was a silver lining.

Floors throughout terminal 1 appear to rarely get swept or mopped. Im amazed the airport can pass a foodservice inspection. We ate breakfast at the wendys and the seating areas and tables had spilled drinks and food all around the dining space. Trash overflowing. It seems the cleaning crew are non existent or inept.

The D concourse appears to have more amenities which appear to have more amenities than the B concourse. The concourse is bright and spacious. Departure was from B concourse. The B concourse has only 2 restaurants and lacks amenities. Slot machines take up most of the space at the gates which makes for a very crowded gate area. I didn't notice any in seat USB and/or power outlets. The B concourse needs major renovations to align it the modern and spacious terminals you see at other airports. There is no lounge at either B or C concourse. Free Airport WiFi is fast. We dined at PGA restaurant. One of the worst meals we've had. Our meals were comped (fish & chips) as it was not up to the restaurant's standards.,1,LAS

Had a layover for a red eye, never a great situation but this airport is especially terrible between 1 am and 6 am. There aren’t many bathrooms in this airport to begin with, and then they shut down every bathroom in the airport at the same time for cleaning around 2am, so good luck. Need to sleep at the gate? Well, the seats have huge metal arm rests to prevent sleeping, so the gate was full of uncomfortable people trying to sleep upright. Then they have loud rock music playing nonstop. And, on top of that the person driving the floor cleaner up and down the walkway constantly honks the horn on it as she passes the terminal full of people trying to sleep. I get that it needs to be cleaned and there is never a great time for that, but blowing the horn nonstop was unnecessary.",-1,LAS

The shuttle buses take forever to come and they send one of the time every 20 minutes to half an hour with hundreds of people waiting in line, then at the rental car center the lines get even worse.

Very poor signage directing which of many carousels our bags would unload on. When I finally located the correct carousel, the switched it. Poor signage directing travelers to appropriate doors (there are many, many doors) for rental cars. No airport staff on hand to assist. No readily sighted baggage service areas if my bags hadn't showed up (and again, no one I could have asked.) All rent a cars are located in a terminal about 15 minutes away. You have to queue for a common bus to take you there. Long wait for busses both arriving and returning to airport. Bus operations staff generally rude and unhelpful. The departure side of the operations was somewhat better but the rental car return was again, not well run.

We have not flown in 2 years. We are Pre TSA and are flying Sun Country. The check in for Sun Country was great. Going through TSA was another story. The gentleman at the walk through scanner was very rude. I set the beeper off. I said it was probably my anklet. He said that was not possible. I told him that it had happened before. He told me again that was impossible. I removed my Apple Watch and two bracelets. I then was able to go through the scanner. I felt that he was very rude.

2021-07-30,0.5,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,the TSA checkpoint was confusing and frustrating,False,"  Going through the TSA checkpoint was confusing and frustrating. The TSA agents kept giving me conflicting instructions. Take off your shoes, you can put your shoes back on if you walked through the K9 area, put your shoes on to walk through the metal detector. It made absolutely no sense and when I acknowledged it I just received blank stares from them. The conveyor belt stopped working because someone’s bag jammed it because the TSA agents failed to tell the person to put their bag in a tray. I watched them watch the person put the bag loose on the conveyor belt and then fail to give them correct instructions. Then as they were trying to fix the jammed conveyor belt a TSA agent came over to where I was and said that it had stopped working because a tray was still in the tray dispenser. I don’t believe this had anything to do with what the problem was, and there were trays sitting in other tray dispensers, but they decided it was the one in front of me that was the problem and gave me stern look. Again, that makes no sense, my tray didn’t jam it. They need to improve their system and communicate better with each other and with people who are traveling because we are not mind readers. I see this happen a lot with incompetent employees, they can easily blame the customer for a problem. In this case it really seemed like the TSA agents were causing problems for themselves. What would a person gain by not following instructions and delaying their travel time at the airport?

You park on International or Domestic side which both lead you to terminal 3 D Gates. We almost missed our flight for departure because the security gate was not open and had no other way to get to gate C. We had all 3 teams to get there. When arriving try to find the Tram but you can only take a shuttle. I asked several people where to get to long term parking and not one person could answer other than leading me to Public parking. Never mentioned a tram. So we wonder around again looking for a way to get to Terminal 3 because we arrived in terminal 1. There are no signs anywhere but on the last elevator by the front door. All the TSA agents were absolutely rude when asked any questions. Not only by us but by anyone around I saw asking them how to get to a location.

I don't stereotype but this falls right in line with what I would have guessed. I re-screened and passed. Looked at the TSA agent and told him to have a really great day. TSA body scans kids. I know, because they tried to scan mine. Just because shes tall doesn't make her older. Seating areas look like the 1980's. Charging ports in that area are few and far between.

I was immediately approached by the ‘traffic person’ before I even got it open. She rudely told me to move on. I said my friend was approaching but she again told me I needed to move. My friend was approaching my car but this rude woman told me to point her out because she didn’t believe me. There were only three or four people who had finished crossing the walkway. There was no line of cars waiting for anything, in fact there were very few cars there at all, but this woman was determined to make me leave. That’s when my friend stopped with her luggage to put into the trunk. I had been stopped less than two minutes. The woman didn’t leave us even then but continued to be as unpleasant as she could. My friend and I are both in our mid seventies and I hate to think how someone with a disability would be treated.

2021-03-31,0.3,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,LAS is just a really dirty airport overall,True," For such a newly improved airport, McCarran sure is trash! This is the worst practically new airport I've seen anywhere in the world. I don't know what the casino revenues collected in Vegas, or even the airport itself, are going toward, but it sure isn't toward having a meaningfully modern, efficient airport, despite the many years and dollars spent on revitalization. For the pros - 1) Baggage claim was actually efficient. 2) Signage inside the airport was ample. That's about it. As for the cons? 1) There is no efficient means to take a rideshare or taxi, as the wait for either can be over an hour. It took me 40 minutes and I felt lucky compared to the people around me. 2) There's no effective means of public transportation to the Strip and this is considering that the airport is practically on the Strip! Not even a monorail. 3) The terminals have mostly new, though very depressing and uninviting, architecture and design. 4) The terminals were poorly lit, in both the late evening and early morning. 5) I saw a tiny handful of anyone working in the airport who smiled, or who otherwise just didn't look angry. 6) Airline (baggage claim) and security personnel were almost entirely ill-mannered and officious. Not just ""having a stressful morning and need coffee,"" but flat-out rude. 7) Apparently this airport doesn't believe in automated check-in and baggage machines, even though they're chock full of them, Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc. weren't operating theirs, and required their passengers to stand in long lines (of course, if you checked in in advance and have no baggage to claim, this isn't a problem for you). 8) LAS is just a really dirty airport overall, plain and simple. 9) Practically nothing was open in the airport at either 9pm or 6am, I guess this isn't a huge deal to me only because we're still in the midst of a pandemic. I understand that LAS has to interact with a never-ending array of passengers who don't even understand clear airport signage or etiquette, but I would respectfully suggest that LAS look to Salt Lake City (stunning new airport with overall great service) or even Phoenix (which is above-average but not great) as examples of how to operate a respectable airport.",-1,LAS

She had already flown with her new name in their system, but the Spirit staff member was amazing helping her cancel her flight and then re-book it to comply with TSA. Long story short they asked her to travel with a name that is no longer her legal name. She had all the documents needed marriage certificate, new social, new debit cards, new temporary license, and her passport with her maiden name, and her old voided I.D. but it still wasn't enough.

My dad was trying to be my brothers partner because he’s afraid of dogs. But the lady TSA agent wasn’t listening because she was yelling at him to go.

I’m all for security, but rummaging through a 13 year olds bag while looking at her and not the contents of her bag which is falling on the floor is awful. They didn’t check anything, not even her eyeglass case. Just tossed everything around and let it fall on the floor. Then took my 17 year olds bag away without explanation to the walkthrough screening out of view, wouldn’t answer where they’d were taking bag, squatted and searched out of our view and sent bag back. My visibly upset, crying, angry daughter was made fun of by TSA so I said that it was wrong to make fun of a kid. He said he was “communicating” with his coworker to see if he was in trouble. Communicating in customer service is asking if coworker needs help. He was just being a mean person. Then the man asked if she wanted to speak to a supervisor, and my daughter said yes. TSA agent simply walked away telling everyone he didn’t know why she was so upset. When my daughter opened her bag, nothing but her underwear was touched (it was on a pocket on side of the bag).

I had flown out of LAS with the same tool not even 5 days before with no problems. TSA was very nice about it, but I still had to throw away a gift from a friend no longer with me. The reason I couldn't have this tool? it had a 2in ""saw"" blade. My question is what am I supposed to do with a 2in sawblade thats going to cause such havoc that I cant bring it with me?

I thought that since it was a smaller airport, it was be easier. Man, was I wrong! We left from the huge Atlanta airport and went through TSA with no problems. At McCarran, the people were rude, we had to stand in front of a machine to be scanned with our legs spread and arms up over our heads. Then we were frisked! Everyone had to do both of those things, not in Atlanta! I also made the mistake of buying a gift of lotion for a friend and it was confiscated! I know that I don't look like a terrorist, but I do know their rules. The woman had absolutely no empathy at all. The lotion was still factory wrapped. What the heck do they do with the things that they confiscate? That lotion was $20. I've never been treated so badly at any airport ever! Pre TSA is strongly advised here.",-1,LAS

To say they are arrogant, angry, condescending, and very loud would be an understatement. I have never been treated with so little respect while going through security in my life. Commands were shouted and if not complied with immediately further abuse was received. I purposely wear a plastic belt to enable easy pass through security but an officer barked at me to remove it. I accidentally left a hotel key in my pocket and this gave me the pleasure of a full body pat down including my crotch and hand swab. My carry on had to re x-rayed because I failed to separate all items as requested and I was suitably chastised for my inability to complete their orders. In addition they insist on shoe removal, even when I was wearing plastic flip flops. In conclusion I hope this situation with the TSA improves as this experience has left a bad taste in mouth after fun few days in Las Vegas.",-1,LAS
2019-11-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"Terrible, shameful treatment",False," Visited Las Vegas for the first time recently. Our trip was wonderful, but our experience traveling through this airport ruined it. From the Fox Rental Car shuttle the bad treatment started, and it just got worse. Nearly every 'service' person we dealt with, from the American Airlines check-in, to the shop assistants, TSA, Burger King lady, and nearly every AA representative we were forced to deal with was breathtakingly rude, and sometimes downright bullying. And my husband and I are very polite and patient people. We spent the night in the freezing airport due to AA incompetence and got nothing but hostility from nearly everyone we (politely) approached for help or information. When we were finally put on a plane with the help of one American Airlines employee, I witnessed at least four other passengers being treated terribly for no reason. It's like they are trained to abuse their clients. The icing on the cake was the 2 AA cabin crew members getting into a very loud fight in the back of the plane. The tension on the plane was palpable. I've never experienced this in my life, and suddenly the news reports about passengers flipping out on planes seemed understandable. I'm not surprised, if it happens on American Airlines, and guess what? It would be totally the fault of those employees. Terrible, shameful treatment of their clients. I will never fly AA again, and will never pass through McCarron airport again. Beware!",-1,LAS

While waiting in the line, we were up next and we see this one officer who's just staring at us. While I am used to them signalling us to proceed and seeing nothing from him, I asked if we could. To this he shouts from there ""why are you making things difficult?"". I asked him softly, ""how did we make things difficult for you?. We were waiting for you to let us know if we could proceed"".

I asked another staff why we can’t use the passport scanners and got another answer “There aren’t enough immigration officers”. Well, isn’t that the point?

Yes it does not have a WiFi connection but only in the main terminal. No phone to order taxi as well. So if you of a need to order a taxi at 3 am as we did, you have to drag your several suitcases with you to the outside parking over a small bridge back to the parking just to find out that there is no internet there so you will not be able to see if your taxi is coming. So the solution is to run between the main terminal to the parking and from the main terminal to the Uber parking, this is a very disappointing for this level of airport, what a shame. The shuttle to rent a car organizes was very rude and did not organize the lineup at all, he was just standing there beside the bus doing nothing and when I said to him that he should do his job he was rude.",-1,LAS

You will be harassed. When I asked the first security officer if he could request an opt out he said it will be a long time and you need to ask the guy on the other side of security. Well that is awkward because you have to go through the line to talk to the guy on the other side of security, at every other airport that person is the one to request an opt out. I was finally able to ask him. Disgruntled he requested a female opt out. He told me to wait in a small crowded corner where the floor was covered in trash, as I was wearing no shoes. Later when asked if the opt out was female he said, ""um I think so"". I am currently looking very female and very pregnant. After a while an upset woman waved me over. She was rude in very thing she said. I travel a lot, I've had over 20 pat downs being pregnant and none of them were humiliating at all, let alone this humiliating. She directed me to stand between lines of people getting their stuff on a mat, as she barked what she was doing. As she started explaining the pat down she struggled through every part, rolling her eyes, and being sarcastic. She never told me I was good to get my stuff. She just walked away once the swab was tested. I will be using the Saint George airport from now on, when I need to come to this area.

From the obnoxiously rude woman at the Frontier counter to the unorganized, inefficient, demeaning, and harassing TSA agents I was completely shocked that Las Vegas Airport allows these people to represent a city who’s economy is based solely on Tourism. TSA can have a reputation, but the staff of LAS go far above and beyond to berate and belittle travelers, I was astounded by their treatment of a woman in a wheelchair and a man who’s luggage and person was being inspected. I'm embarrassed that these employees get their kicks out of feeling more powerful than airport patrons by being bullies. The airport is dirty and reeks of cigarettes and the design is unfortunate (the closest bathroom to my gate was a good 10 minute walk, only to find out it was closed for cleaning and I had to wander another long hall in the wrong direction while my flight was boarding).

",True," McCarran International Airport (Las Vegas) is one of the worst airports I have ever had the displeasure of using. Where to begin? The only good thing about this airport is it is very close to the city center. Otherwise, it's loud, crowded and uncomfortable. No matter the hour, loud rock and country music is playing. No place to escape the assault on your senses. People are crowded into gate areas that are too small with inadequate and uncomfortable seating. People are sitting and laying all over like in some post-apocalyptic scene. The rental car shuttle consists of smelly, old diesel buses with rude personnelle that yell out instructions. The food choices consist of over-priced fast food. Once again, inadequate seating in the restaurant areas. Huge lines to everything with more rude people treating passengers like cattle.",-1,LAS

I have been traveling with appropriately sized containers to make sure something like this didn't happen for years, yet now my less than 4 oz container is now more than 4 oz and you want to escort me an hour back in time to the back of the line to keep the container? At the very least the staff that couldn't figure out how to scan my boarding pass and told me I needed to go back across the airport to reprint it could have been more polite (and after protesting, another staff member at least tried the pass and got it to work).

When we returned to depart later that week, we turned up one hour early so we had to wait an hour before check-in. Seating was adequate and comfortable. Check-in process was fast and effective. One confusing thing is that I was travelling with a friend and I got exempted for TSA Pre Check. So we had to split lines and Wait for him after security. Overall smooth and efficient.

After we went through security, we did not see my father. We started to panic and frantically looked for him for him all over the airport. We asked a few LAX employees where we could possibly find him. They shrugged and acted like they didn't care. None of them got on their phones or walkie-talkies to communicate with each other.

We were instructed, by another TSA agent, to find any open space for the bins and use it. A couple in front of us obviously didn't know how this TSA worked, and neither did I, in addition, to taking their time and holding up the line. In the mean time, the older women TSA agent wasn't paying attention and was making small talk with the couple. I had already placed items in 2 bins, and stacked another because she wasn't paying attention and her male co-worker was giving my mom (who was unable to move bins because of surgery) instructions to put a heavier suitcase in a bin. The way the luggage line is set up, there is a divider and the TSA agent has to pull the bins from the customer side to allow them to move toward the xray area on their side to create space. I attempted to maneuver the bins and then waited, but there was still no space in front of me, so I took one of the two spaces that the  couple was not using, because the older TSA agent wasn't paying attention. The TSA agent then gets an attitude with me and tells me that I took the white woman's space that was in front of her; but, the woman of the couple had 2 spaces without bins and she was holding up the line and I needed to get to my flight. So I proceeded to tell the TSA agent that I was helping my mother because he coworker was instructing my mother to put items in a new bin and rushing her along and my mother wasn't able because of her arm, and I asked her, since she wasn't moving the bins in front of me to create space, what did she expect me to do, and she stated to ""hold it (the bin)!"" Really?! I attempted to explain to her that her coworkers instructions and her instructions were conflicting and that I was trying to help my mother. She continued to go back and forth with me. The male coworker was apologetic after we told him of my mother's condition, but the older agent continued to be rude, which caused me to also respond. This could have been resolved if the TSA agent was paying attention and moving the bags along and instructed the female to place her items in one of the spaces and allow me to place my items in the other space. The couple continue to talk about me and the situation and my mother became upset because they were saying I was mean and inconsiderate but that couldn't have been furthest from the truth. The situation only escalated after the couple, along with the TSA agent, continued to be inconsiderate of others trying to make their flights.",1,LAX

The Cancun delay of 1 hour 30 had changed my connection time to one hour. Usually an impossible task. I was in luck and was travelling using disability services due to a broken foot. The disability services had been arranged for each leg and when I mentioned my predicament the staff were just absolutely amazing. Firstly the lady who name I can’t remember got me through customs and bag pickup in minutes, handed me over to a waiting disability transfer van she had called ahead for. Once in the international terminal a gentleman by the name of Lyn made a personal effort to get me through all the check points radioing ahead to let all staff know he had a passenger whose flight was boarding. Once through all checks he got me on a golf cart and raced me to my gate. Without the tremendous kindness and effort of these staff members I wouldn’t have made it. I made an extra effort to be courteous, kind, thankful and called everybody by name. It’s amazing how far people will go if you are actually thankful and polite.

No markings on where to go. Incredibly slow and crowded. Nowhere to sit. I'm glad I had I 3 hour layover because I spent every bit of it just getting to my connecting flight. TSA was incredibly rude and wouldn't look you in the eye when talking to them.  I still cant believe its an airport on US soil. Its shameful. I will never transit through there again.,-1,LAX

2023-07-18,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,nothing but chaos,False,"  LAX Airport security is horrible. I have a pre-existing condition with high blood pressure and issues with my legs. Was not well when walking through the check point and forgot I had my keys in my pocket. I showed security my keys and they were snatched out of my hand and thrown into the scanner to the left of me. The key ring had all of my keys, from apartment keys to my car keys. Security lost my keys. I submitted an online claim as they apparently do not have a phone number to call, my claim was closed citing could not verify ownership, could not find the missing item. My car key alone when getting back home here in Cleveland was over $200 to replace as it also is a key fob for locking, unlocking, and remote starting my car. The rest of my experience at LAX Airport was nothing but chaos. I understand that there is construction there currently but there needs to be better organization there and Security needs to get it together and not be horrible to everyone that comes through because there may end up being someone that comes through that has a critical condition and the way the mistreat folks might end up sending them to the hospital. Wheelchair assistance was not great as that was request for myself and my mother however only 1 wheelchair was brought to us at the time.",-1,LAX
2023-06-11,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,discriminates against people in wheelchairs,True," TSA Security discriminates against people in wheelchairs. Be forewarned, you will need an extra 30+ minutes if they can not walk through a scanner. Tampa International Airport let us skip most of the security line and had someone almost immediately to pat her down and wand her in her wheelchair. LAX gave us no priority in line. Once we arrived at the security gates the rest of my party went through. They held my mom in her wheelchair for 20+ minutes! And no justification other than they want to be lazy and not do their jobs. I highly recommend keeping your handicapped loved ones far from LAX.",-1,LAX

I was traveling with both of my elderly parents, and they transfered us from one set of wheelchairs to another to another to a golf cart, to another set of wheelchairs, to a bus, to another set of wheelchairs, and then the boarding wheelchairs never showed up, and we had a terribly long walk for my parents. My parents had a VERY hard time climbing into the golf carts, and mom nearly fell twice, and on the second golf cart she was not belted in. It´s ridiculous to make elderly people change wheelchairs so many times. It was utterly exhausting for them. At all other airports we have ever been to, it´s one to two sets of wheelchairs and that´s it. I give LAX a ZERO on the scale of 1 to 10. I will avoid traveling to LAX in the future.",-1,LAX

It is the worst airport I have ever been to. Not only is it not clean, but everything is overpriced and the food isn't even worth the $20 per person.  There are very few ""name brand"" restaurants here, so I have to blindly trust that the food here will be decent. There is almost no seating for people to sit in the terminal and it is so bad.",-1,LAX
2022-09-25,0.7,Family Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,impressed with the experience,True,"  My review only focusses on the Tom Bradley International Terminal, so, for any other terminals within LAX, I cannot comment. LAX is generally a good airport, the arrival area is nice until you get to the immigration area. It is small and some of the screens were glitching. It seemed tatty too. After an 11-12 hour flight, it isn't the best thing waiting for an hour and a half in the queue either. Having said that, the vibe was calm and staff seemed organised with the queue system. None of the staff were rude or pushy. Signage could be improved for arrivals. There is a nicely lit and futuristic tunnel once you've cleared immigration and you can take a shuttle bus to LAX-it (their Uber/Lyft stand). Great idea but too expensive! Very disappointed that there isn't a metro/train service yet, being from the UK. I am aware that in late Autumn 2022, there will be a people mover connecting out from LAX. The Departures is very nice. Like Arrivals, the staff are organised. However, it is easy to quickly get through and to get to Airside. Airside feels a lot like Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar; think of it as a compliment LAX! The shops are generally good, however, food options could be better. The layout was simple but effective. The airy area, shops and screens definitely gave the area a nice metropolitan feel. Getting to your gate is super easy. Overall, was impressed with the experience, was very surprised as I had low expectations for a US airport.",1,LAX
2022-06-25,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Absolutely disgraceful,True,"  Absolutely disgraceful. Apparently nobody working at the US Customs and Border Protection. Nothing like getting off a 14 hour flight then waiting in a 2 hour immigration line. Absolutely avoid flying in to LAX if any other option is available at all. Despicable lack of signage and crowd control. People were piling up on the moving walkways with nowhere to go like the chocolates in I Love Lucy, which was downright dangerous. Shameful, shameful showing from the airport staff here.",-1,LAX

Staff was not very helpful I have to walk from terminal 6 down to terminal 3 and back to terminal 2 to get my boarding pass then back to terminal 3 again for security because I was told terminal 2 was closed by the security officers immigration guys. I almost missed my flight because of this. And so many constructions going on and prompting and instructions was not clear enough and very confusing. I will not use this airport any longer until they make some changes.,-1,LAX
2022-05-02,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,homeless men and women sleeping all over the building,True,"  Upon arriving at Terminal 1, my sister and I kept seeing people sleeping on the ground in the terminal (before TSA check in). We at first thought they were waiting for a connecting flight but then realized they were filthy and had belongs in trash bags with them. Flying back into LAX at 10 pm we were shocked to see even more homeless men and women sleeping all over the building. No one is doing anything about this! What an awful first time coming to California and your first impression will be of homeless people all over the airport.",-1,LAX

ALL motorized walkways and escalators switched off. Had to dangerously carry heavy bags and cases up a non working escalator. Then to get to the departure gate back down a non working escalator. Departure gate seats covered in other passengers trash and just left. All in all a very unpleasant experience. Most concerning if all is the strong likelihood someone would have a serious accident walking Up and down escalators which appear to be just switched off to save money as the terminal not That busy. Disgraceful !",-1,LAX

I just got off 2 back to back 11 hour flights from India and was very jet-lagged. Went through security and since it was my first time at LAX and was in a brain fog I didn’t move my bin right away to make space for the next person. A TSA security woman yelled at me saying I was taking up all the space and yelled “So selfish!” rudely in front of everyone. It was embarrassing and disrespectful. She could have kindly asked me to move along. Another TSA worker spoke disrespectfully to my mom when she didn’t understand what he was saying, he spoke to her like a child when she has a mental illness disability. On top of that 3 people refused to take my mom in her requested wheelchair because they didn’t feel like taking another connecting flight and were visibly annoyed. Ridiculous, unprofessional, disrespectful staff and things are not run efficiently. Made me not want to travel to LAX again.",-1,LAX

People are crammed into the departure gates like cattle as there is simply nowhere near enough space or seating. My pregnant wife was left sitting on the hard floor for hours while we waited, being stepped on and over the entire duration. With covid in full force, I felt very uncomfortable in this incedibly claustrophobic small space. I have never felt the need to review a single thing in the past but felt it was important to draw attention to the situation lax has allowed, leaving their passengers trapped, exposed and abused. Expand your airport or do not allow your airport to reach this capacity. This is unacceptable in today's social distance world and masks are not sufficient. Also, I feel it is worth mentioning that if you manage to find a spot to sit and eat, the food is beyond horrible.",-1,LAX

If the right people are not working, they'll refuse you a private room for screening, and make you wait at the normal security checkpoints. Theirs is super disorganized. They made us wait 15 minutes while holding our cats in our arms. After they let multiple people pass us without pets go, we asked when we would be able to go through. The person working the line got angry with us and said you're going last. We had to wait for a few too many more people out of their spite. You all just lost my business.",-1,LAX

You are processed through from baggage to boarding like cattle. Even the LAPD assigned there for traffic duty are unprofessional.

Coming back to travel after COVID and transmitting thru LAX was so disappointing. Not enough seats for passengers at the gate. Few bathrooms. Buses from regional planes instead of airjets. Terminals still not connected past security after twenty years, you have to take a bus or go out and back thru security if you change terminals. They should hire whoever made MSP awesome.

Barely any places for people to sit and long lines all over the place. TSA workers are rude as anything here. They like to yell and talk to you in a condescending tone, like you're dumb - typical character. Their training must be to treat every individual like a threat.

They were in CA to care for our 94 year old father, who was hospitalized, then recovering at home, not a vacation. The terminal was unable to handle the numbers of people, and there are two blocks lined up outside the terminal for checking baggage. Although they were at the airport hours early, they will miss their flight due to this inefficiency. They are now in another extremely long line at Special Services. There is no reason for this other than extreme inefficiency on the part of the airport, and the over-booking by American Airlines. Travel for family emergencies should never be this difficult.",-1,LAX

Thank you so much for your efforts. This woman not only throes to find my children’s tickets information, but she personally ran with my kids and I to make our flight. She took my children to their seats I felt like we were in the movie home alone lol. I saw what our surroundings were and it was chaotic. Thank you for night just telling me to turn left turn a mother left and have a good day. You were amazing. My kids made their flight to see their grandparents today because of you.

If that was not enough, I have never had to deal with a more rude and uncouth staff than here. I was travelling with a couple of tech items and the rude lady at security started screaming (yes, screaming) contradictory instructions at me while I was simply getting everything on the trays. Later, while I was trying to remove and assemble my things from 4 trays after passing through security, I have another lady telling me thrice to stack up my trays. In which airport is that the job of a passenger? Every airport I have ever been to either uses belts that automatically stack these up or airport personnel do this manually. How is a passenger supposed to be stacking trays with hands full of expensive things that need to be repacked? Would recommend flying via SFO instead because LAX has got to be the worst airport in the world in every possible aspect.",-1,LAX
2021-05-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,the worst airport I’ve experienced,True," LA international airport is the worst airport I’ve experienced, seriously, in the world. And I’ve travelled to a lot of places. I felt the same way when I came through this airport about 5 years ago, but it was under construction of some kind so I assumed there was good reason. Nope, still appalling. No construction today but equally dismal. Shocking really, an embarrassment to America. Nowhere to sit other than the gates and a handful of dirty tables in a food course (7!) – and no plug points available for people needing to charge devices (well all apparently deliberately turned off), despite the obvious necessity), and no real food – all fast food, at absurdly exorbitant costs. I paid $20 for one fish taco (takeaway fast food) and a beer. As my first stop in my homeland after 3 years, I feel like getting on the next plane out again. Shame on you LA airport designers! Horrific. Then one is bombarded by continuous loud repetitive messaging from megaphones. Seriously, take a trip to Paris and learn a bit of class for pleasurable airport environment – that is, if you care about customer experience.",-1,LAX

Our flight was changed and rather than connecting through San Francisco we connected through LAX. The airport is even worse than it used to be. Extremely dirty, and run down. I am sure there are some Covid restrictions in play but this is the only airport to which I have traveled where almost all food establishments are closed. For the entire Alaska terminal there were just three very busy very dirty places in operation.",-1,LAX

I was attempting to locate a bathroom and terminal 2, when I accidentally walked through the exit gate. I walked 15 feet into the hallway and realized my mistake. I did attempt to return through the gate and was stopped. I explained that I was trying to find the bathroom and I just got off a plane and was connecting to another. The security person wanted to look at my boarding pass so I showed it to her. She said this is not a boarding pass and would not let me return to the terminal. I said I just got off a plane and I am not going to go through security, I had to reprint my boarding pass, wait in line for tsa screening. I just made it back to my gate as it was boarding. No one was helpful. I was very very angry at the situation.",-1,LAX

This is an update of the review I posted yesterday. I missed two consecutive days of flights at LAX because of Copa Airline's lack of communication, systems malfunction, and also the incompetency of the Copa Airline's rude staff at LAX airport. I now found out that my return flight for this trip that didn't happen has been mysteriously changed to a day earlier. I didn't make a request to change the return date because I never make it to the destination. I'm waiting until later today to get to the Copa counter to talk to someone there and make my request, so I do not understand how this happened.

2020-10-19,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,2.0,,3.0,,,,1.0,just unacceptable behavior,False,"  Worst experience I’ve ever had within the first 10 minutes of being here. Now let me preface this with a large thank you to those working under the circumstances of a pandemic. This is not easy work and I appreciate those who come to work everyday. I understand that many things have changed and are changing to accommodate COVID-19 mandates and regulations. With that being said, I am still a customer and expect a certain standard of customer service.  First we walk in and have already checked in online so no need to go to the kiosks. My father and I walk over to go through TSA. A gentleman asks to see our boarding pass. This ain’t where they scan the boarding pass by the way. So my father shows him his boarding pass on his phone and the gentleman walks away from us. A few seconds later he walks over to us and in a raised tone asks to see my boarding pass. So my father shows him my boarding pass on his phone. The gentleman proceeds to tell us in a raised and non-neutral tone that why would we think to not to shows the other pass. Okay, I get your point but isn’t it unprofessional to speak to people that way. AND you didn’t even look at the boarding pass. So we go in line, ignoring the guy still ranting to us and go to scan out boarding passes. The names were switched for our seats and were showing up wrong on the phone and his scanner. Instead of being patient and working with us to see what was wrong, he rolls his eyes and says “my computer says something different so I can’t let you pass”. Again, totally understand that is a rule that you must follow. However, there’s no need to roll your eyes because we are just as confused as you. We the. Go through TSA. What an absolute mess. Everything is so backed up by the continue to let people go through. So after you go through the scanner you need to wait in line AGAIN to get your belongings. And by wait in line I mean for 5 minutes. Doesn’t seem like a long time but ideally it should take one minute for my belongings to be checked after I have been scanned. There are workers standing around chatting it up instead of helping their coworkers. What kind of team is that? I just don’t understand what kind of place would allow their workers to speak to customers in those tones. Now, it’s not like we raised our voices first. I’m all for customer service employees to stand up for themselves when being disrespected. No one should have to put up with that. However, we never raised our voices or put blame onto the workers yet we were disrespected because? Don’t forget those workers who are doing their job. Especially with a pandemic, there’s no reason for extra people to just be standing around. You are increasing their risk and the risk of others. This is just unacceptable behavior.",-1,LAX
2020-10-11,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,this airport has some serious issues,False,"  Don't fly in or out of here! This airport is a joke, and I’ve flown all around the country, by far this airport has some serious issues with pretty much everything. The terminals are being remodeled, so we got off and onto a bus that dropped us off at a door that then took us back into the airport to get extremely lost because, why would you put direction signs? Getting your car from the car rental is another chore that you get to wait for a bus to take you to. Don’t let me get started on that complete mess, no organization, poor customer service, it took us from the airport to actually getting the car over an hour! On our departure, we got dropped off at the bottom level baggage claim by our lovely, being so sarcastic here, car rental bus driver. Again, no signs of directions to anything! Finally figuring things out on our own, because apparently no one works here at 6 am, getting through TSA was pure hell! I’ve never been talked down to, yelled at, or felt like I was doing something wrong, this is exactly how I felt the entire experience going through TSA. It really solidified me never flying into or out of LAX ever again. Fly into Long Beach of John Wayne Orange County.",-1,LAX

The staff/officers on the ground are rude and are not helpful at all. I checked with 4 different officers, that I have a connecting flight in 2 hours and my visa type is L2. I was just told with a loud voice ""I said, all passengers in one queue"". Result: I had to wait in the queue, go to the kiosk, enter my details which only indicated that the kiosk does not accept L2 visa and I need to continue to go to the customs queue (what a waste of time!). And then the customs queue again was one single queue (All visa types, all transiting passengers). I missed my connecting flight and had to wait 6 hours for the next flight. Had even one officer said, your Visa goes directly to the customs queue or if there was clear signage, it would have saved 6 hours of my life! Safe to say, for a passenger the airport staff is the first contact with the country. And LAX is failing miserably at representing the USA. If someone from the airport is reading this review, you only need the following queues at immigration: 1) US and Canadian citizens --> Use the dedicated mobile passport area (no queuing required) 2) One queue for Transit cardholders (to a country outside the US) 3) One queue for connecting flight (within the US) boarding pass holders 4) One queue for people actually immigrating It will only make passengers but also your life easier.

Since I am new to living in LA, I didn’t know it was Terminal 1. Took my 40 min to drive 10 miles and when I got to the terminal there was no clear signage that stated where to pick up arrivals. I called my friend and while I was on the phone with her, within 10 seconds, an airport cop told me to keep driving and go all the way around to pick her up. He knew very well that it’d take me another 30-40 min to do that. I responded “my friend is right there!” as she was walking towards us. Within a minute, he decides to write me a $100 ticket.

This is a ridiculous and appalling standard for what is meant to be one of the biggest international airports in the USA. I know the reason is that they're building a train but this should have been done years ago and having your customers walk for 30 minutes with their bags or risk missing their flights is not an option.

Imagine flying from abroad into LAX, having to go through customs with your bags, but not being able to check your bags for the flight out to wherever you live, as the flight leaves more than 4 hours from arrival.

Passport control staff were (quote) “at the end of shift” and were more focussed on leaving work than getting the backlog of passengers through.

The whole part of that building was bus station like with only one small shop. It was very much amateur hour that evening on gate 138 because the check in staff had been looking without success for a bus coordinator for the last 90 minutes. No bus coordinator equals no bus!. We eventually boarded a bus and were taken out to a remote stand (not BAs fault as they were also keen to point out). Then we had to walk up a series of ramps to board the aircraft.

I spent the first six hours trying to find a place to charge my phone. There are a few outlets next to the restrooms, but they were all taken. This is the worst airport I've ever been to.

I was there to pick up a passenger arriving on KLM from Amsterdam. It was difficult to know where to park. It was impossible to know where to meet arrivals. We were sent by an employee to Terminal 2. It was a very long walk from Terminal B, where it turned out we should have been to meet the passenger. There was very inadequate signage. Non-existent information with current arrivals and flight time. Very unfriendly employees. We are both in our 80’s. Not enough seats. Physically grueling.

Baggage reclaim was 10 mins and only because the oversized baggage guy didn’t have a clue or certainly didn’t want to help. The convoluted entry system, really?? That’s no way to treat people, non US citizens or not. It’s disgusting. Queue after queue, long and slow. Hang your heads is shame.

In confusion, I pulled over and asked for clarification and direction. Within 10 seconds, my husband entered the car, but I noticed the officer noted my plates. Still in confusion, I asked the officer what he was trying to tell me in motioning. He refused to explain but told me I would be getting a ticket. He refused to provide his last name. This, with a very smug attitude, leaving me in further confusion, now in stress. What was he motioning to me? Why was he noting my plates? Why did he say he was ticketing me? Why wouldn’t he explain? Why was he so smug and disrespectful? I've never been so confused, stressed, and treated with such disrespect.

It’s like do we just keep kicking the can down the road or overhaul this hell hole. Has the worst parts of Philly airport, taking busses between terminal transfers, but none of the good things.

Then on top of our flight being delayed 2 hours and 45 minutes without a reason why, we were forced to wait near the terminals where there was about 1/3 of the seating as there were people in the terminals. Tons of empty space there could have been seating installed. Floors absolutely disgusting with trash and food everywhere on top of broken down restrooms. By far the most awfully designed and maintained terminal I've ever had to wait in my life, including 3rd world countries I've traveled to and from that were more nice than this. This place should be shut down especially for how greedy they are with flight prices on top of every single flight I've booked this month being delayed and only one being from an actual weather issue which I understand is out of the airports control and didn't make a fuss about.

Newark is the worst but LAX is a close second. TSA is usually at least ambilavent with their attitude but slow always. There is never enough chairs in the terminal, I usually sit on the floor. Much worse though, is the attendants outside who shoo away people trying to pick up their loved ones. These guys could not be more rude about this literally every single time. The power goes to their heads in such a pathetic way. I’m waiting for my mom and he asks me to go all the way around again, but I can see her she’s just zipping up a bag and this guy starts writing my license plate number down and taking pictures of me. Even when you do move like they want you to, they will just harass you again when you come back around. They act like you came to the airport just to annoy them and there is no necessity for their job. I feel bad because they do just want to keep the line moving but I’ve never seen the arrivals get that cramped that they need this weird pickup queue gustappo.",-1,LAX

We arrived with a reasonable amount of time to met our connecting flight. We arrived at the at immigration to find a huge very slow moving queue. They only had about a quarter of the booths open and no one wanted to help us at all. It took 1.5 hours to be processed. We asked several staff if they could help us get to our flight on time and not one person offered any help at all. There was no one to help us get from terminal B to 6 so had to run, which is no mean feat when you are in your 70s. We later found out there is a shuttle which no one told us about. We made our plane but only after member of the public let ups jump the xray queue. On our return trip through your airport we found the signage difficult and at no stage could we find directions to shuttles. This time we were on terminal 7 going to B. We took the wrong option and walked all the way. There is so much you could do to improve your service and I hope that by our next experience things may have changed.

Unfortunately the area of the airport that you can access with bags that still need to be checked only has barstool style seating, or you could just sit on the ground. I have a bad hip. So you know how much it hurts to have to either sit on barstool type chairs, which are really high, or sit on the ground, which is really low, when you have a bad hip?

",True," Oh, where to start. I've been through Riyadh airport (apparently the worst in the world) during a blackout and had a better experience than transiting through LAX. Twice. Both times 4 hour layover, first transit waited for almost 3 hours at immigration and had to run to make my flight. About a third of fellow passengers missed their connections. There were 3 or 4 officers checking passports and another 15 or so mall cops standing around barking orders and generally being unhelpful. Return trip, went through immigration in about 15 minutes but was then told by three seperate employees to go to the wrong terminal. The last was 'Information' desk who told me, with rather shameless dismissiveness, not to worry that my flight wasnt on the departure board. Then went through security to find, surprise, surprise, I was in the worng terminal. There is no information desk airside, eventually had to accost some maintenance workers who kindly made some calls to direct me to the correct terminal. Why this was so hard is incompletely beyond comprehension. Note, I had checked in at the time if my first leg, so gate details were not on my boarding pass. Eventually got to the gate to find people flayed across the ground - for some reason the gate had no seats. By this stage the overwhelming incompetency became comical and I had a good laugh. There were another few terrible encounters with outright obnoxious staff at LAX which on another day I would have cared more about. Allow at least 4 hours for transit and also meditate or pray beforehand (depending on your disposition). I would say avoid but unfortunately there aren't many options.",-1,LAX

",False,"  A lot of the reviews for LAX here are harsh and exaggerated. Personally I think this is an excellent airport, especially the Tom Bradley Terminal. I flew in from Sydney on April 15 and was through immigration and customs in less than 10 minutes. For those of you thinking that was a lucky fluke, this was not my first time getting through this airport quickly on arrival, despite numerous other international flights arriving around the same time (6am). The staff were all courteous. I admit the other terminals need some work and the traffic is bad but they are doing a lot of construction. Orlando and JFK remain the worst airports in the US. LAX and DFW are both excellent.",1,LAX

Ladies & Gentlemen : Exhibit A The Los Angeles Airport A 3rd World, 3rd Class Airport. LAX got its last renovation back in 1984 when the Olympics were in town. Thats about 35 years ago! That is the type of vibe Los Angeles Airport has. The Airport that time forgot. One of the major paradoxes in the world is that Los Angeles gets more visitors than practically anywhere else in the world. Fourth to be Exact for this year. And yet it is an International embarrassment to walk to one and through one. This is even far more true for domestic travels. Yes, I'm pretty sure Joe Biden flew into LAX and that is when he famously is quoted for ""Some of these Airports we have here in the US are 3rd world in class."" There is nothing in these Airports you will ever take your camera and pose with. And that - is tragically - pathetic. How do you spell LAX? P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C. You have Hollywood right here. Legions of iconic celebrities. Monroe. Hepburn. James Dean. Legions of classy world class photographs and you see not one anywhere in this sorry excuse of an airport. How bad Los Angeles Airport is, it a testimony to how pathetic the city's leaders are. No vision. No Class. Just like their airport. A 3rd World Airport. I was here, unfortunately, just this month in April for a flight out with United. Dear God, will someone take a photo of this horror - this sorry excuse for an Airport - and put it next to photos from the Airport in Munich, Hong Kong, Dubai, Singapore or anywhere else in the world. Suffice it to say, Los Angeles Airport - for a world class destination - is firmly cemented in a 3rd world class reputation. If you can avoid the LAX Los Angeles Airport - do so - it is like a Plague. Its not like me to criticize without offering resolutions. Disney. Universal Studios. Have them sponsor a renaissance into the world of tomorrow.

'Did you pay?' 'No, not yet - I was...'. '- then you haven't ordered' - was her interruption, given at such volume most of the customers looked up.

I consider that a successful journey, so no complaints. Departing - Gate area is totally inadequate for the number of flights arriving/departing. I would say there's seating for roughly 1/4 of passengers, with most standing wherever possible. In addition, the eating options are very limited. It was an unpleasant two hours.

I have been diagnosed with severe degenerative disk disease and cannot walk very far at a time. We set out from a domestic terminal at one end of the airport to the international terminal. We had our suitcases in a cart and kept asking employees which way to go. When we reached the end of the building, I asked a group of chatting employees how to reach the international terminal for our flight to Singapore. The female of the group said to go outside and walk about ten minutes and we would be there. She could see my cane, there is no doubt we are elderly and that my husband was pushing a large cart of four suitcases. I asked if that was the only way since it was raining outside and she smiled and said yes. She gave us no indication that there are shuttle buses for travelers so we started walking. It might be 10 minutes for a young person, but it took us at least 30 minutes. Time was not a problem, exhaustion was. We finally made it to the international terminal where there are very few seats...maybe one per 50 passengers. Our airline counter was not yet open so we stood and waited as seats became available. After a couple of hours, I needed to find a restroom which was a very long walk from where we were. No seats and no restrooms. Once we checked in, we were told that it was a very long way to our gate. That was an understatement. Our airline, Singapore Airlines, was the last gate at the farthest end of that terminal. We walked and rested and walked and rested. We were passed up by many carts carrying people. How are you supposed to get a cart? I had asked before we flew if we could get them and was told you just had to happen upon them. We never did, but others sure did. Later I realized that many people waited at the plane upon exiting and the carts were brought to them yet I was told this could not be done for us. The capper to all of this was when we were finally allowed to board, we were taken out into the rain and very strong wind to a bus, from the bus, we climbed stairs onto our plane. I felt like I was back in primitive 1970s Iran. Upon our return, we had a very tight connection and had to get from the international terminal to a domestic terminal. The first employee I saw when we deplaned was a nice man who handed us two orange express connection passes. We took those and rushed for our baggage so we could go thru customs before boarding a domestic flight. We thought those passes would help, but they served no purpose whatsoever. We went to the back of the line just like everyone else. They would have signs directing us to the express connection lines, but they were no faster than regular lines. At least this time I found a kind employee who told us there were shuttle buses we could take to the domestic terminal. That was very helpful, but we rushed as fast as we could and were told there was no way we could make our flight. We will never go thru LAX again. Why no help for disabled travelers? Why do you have to go outside to another terminal? Visit Changi airport in Singapore to see a truly amazing airport. They have lounges you can sleep on, free foot massage machines, clean restrooms, lots of seating, helpful employees and even a nature walk. Even the tiny airport in Dunedin, NZ, is better organized and cleaner than LAX. LAX is crowded, dirty and poorly planned. I consider it the slum of airports and I've seen some pretty pathetic ones in the Middle East.",-1,LAX

She didn't know her way around LAX very well and when asking employees of the airport and airlines, they acted like they didn't have time for her. I will never fly to this airport again.

It was not busy when we arrived Feb 5, 2019, 7:30am so after almost 25 hours travel time we were walking slowly and she said ""move faster, what are you afraid of?"". Then the male personnel at the customs was also rude when he pointed us to the secondary inspection. He said ""go to letter a, don’t you know letter aaaaaaa?"" We are Filipino American professional friends who vacationed together and we are slower but not dumb. We understand the letter a. We were treated way better in other international airports and to be treated this way by our fellow Americans is just unacceptable. The screening of our bags did not produce any ""banned items"" like they ""expected"" coming from the Philippines. We came from Incheon airport and I accidentally forgot to eat a fully wrapped individual banana and the male personnel made it appear a intentionally committed ""crime"". He asked for my passport back and obviously typed something on the computer. When I asked what’s with the passport, he said ""what we do with your passport is none of your business"". What a rude response.

I have travelled this route several times over the last few years and never experienced quite such lengthy and convoluted queues for Immigration. We reached the automatic scanning machines reasonably quickly but then were made to join another queue which spiralled around the arrivals hall, it took 2 hours to reach the manned desk where we were obliged to undergo repeat fingerprint and photography. Why twice for passengers who are only waiting for a plane to be serviced during a 2 hour transit? All that our airline staff could do was to call out that the plane would wait for us! I was then subjected to aggressive questioning around the item which I was legitimately carrying as documented, checked in luggage safely stowed in the hold of the aircraft. Officers threatened that they would unload my luggage for inspection and I would be forced to miss my flight. My passports were confiscated during this process and I was made to wait on the border with no id documents. Three officers discussed this between themselves, none of them asked me for the documentation and I was treated like a criminal. When their supervisor finally arrived after about 20 minutes of this she instructed them to let me go and board the plane which was by this time waiting for me.

International arrivals is a complete cluster. Luggage transfer was a real joy. Why they have a ramp going up makes no sense other than makeing it more difficult for families, elderly and anyone who may have difficulty moving their luggage. Signage is awefull. Good luck finding which way you need to go and employees are no help other than saying keep moving. TSA was a real joy as well. No communication skills at all. Xray machine broke and instead of letting us know they had started moving our stuff to another line we were all just standing around looking at each other wondering whats going on.

I have been here multiple times now, and at this point I had to write a review. Staff are unfriendly and not very clear or helpful when giving directions. I also feel like this place is outdated in design and convenience. Having to take a bus to get from terminal to terminal is inconvenient and time consuming. There are times I want to get food at the limited selection of restaurants, but don't have time to go because the bus schedules are unpredictable. So then your option is the very underwhelming gas style deli counters and vending machines. I'd understand if this was a small airport, but this is a major international hub. I can honestly say when I book flights, I got out of my way to make sure I never connect to this airport and on the few rare occasions I get diverted here because some kind of airline problem, I always groan.",-1,LAX

We had a tight turnaround time to transfer to another flight. There was no assistance from staff to make this easier. We were sent to wrong queues, no empathy was given when airport delays contributed to us being late for our next flight. When we experienced frustration at being told by one staff member that we need not take anything out of our bags when going through security checks and then another reprimanded us for not taking anything out we were told not to come back to America. Staff need to be aware most travellers are just coming off long international flights and just need them to engage in a welcoming manner. A smile occasionally is welcomed. International travellers are not all criminals. We have lives and families just the same as these ‘welcoming’ staff members. As this is the second time we have experienced poor behaviour at this airport, in future we will be attempting to use a different gateway airport into the USA.

I am unsure as to why they had a delay, but imagine it could have been technical - these are overseas planes we are talking about and I am all for them being as safe as possible. The problem was the lack of care I experienced at the airport. When I relayed my nerves about getting to the place on time, the staff seemed apathetic about it. Sure enough, I missed my flight by about five minutes. Like my luggage made it on, but not me kind of close. Now if even one of them had cared enough to offer me a ride or radio the plane to wait, this could have been avoided. Most of them could see that the time was close and even remarked on it, but made no move to actually help me with the problem. But instead, through no fault of my own, I am currently waiting an over six hour layover with no guarantee I will even get on the next flight. The staff for rescheduling were fairly sympathetic and patient about dealing with a very tearful me, since this was not the first major thing to go wrong for me.",-1,LAX

In the therminal we find a family restroom but with other name. It was “All genders restroom” guess what? They all were busy because everyone wants to go and check the restroom so we have to wait and wait. One of the doors in “all genders” restroom was broken. It let you in but you can’t go out. I pushed an emergency button but they didn’t care and I was rescued when other mom with a baby pushed the button from outside. The people on the checking point were rude! I had to wait a long time for my stroller because they placed it on the side and forget to check it, finally when it was cleared, they told me go back to the scanners and pick it up but in that time my baby was so tired and frustrated so he laid down on the floor (very dirty by the way) and cried so I couldn’t move anywhere and I begged them to bring the stroller to me and they just stayed there.

LAX should be ashamed of themselves, treating your customers like cattle. The stress of arriving to (and from) the airport (and it's not just the new construction). Cattle going to the slaughter house are treated more humanely than the unfortunate people who frequent LAX airport. The only slight relief was the refreshment area which lasted one second till he told me the price of a bottle of water. Shame on you. Were we paying for all that excessive marble and advertising glitz in Arrivals? (Thats a whole different complaint). You should be looking at how other airports address the traffic. Barcelona for one, who separate the buses, shuttles, taxis etc from the cars. Its a great stressless experience. Great unassuming restaurants that you pay reasonable prices, shops that cater to the masses instead of the wealthy. Your mantra seems to be grab as much money as you can from the unsuspecting victims and then wait for them to complain. Shame, shame on you. The employees are miserable and rude, not a smile or welcome from any of them. Being shuttled like cattle to the airplane in a miserable over crowded bus. Shame shame. Look at Gatwick airport, where they have a hotel in the airport for early morning travelers, where they have a train station that is an elevator floor away from check in. Stressless and a great experience. LAX is a stressful money grabbing people barking orders mass of confusion. Hateful experience. I would like my money back for the excessive price of the bottled water. Shame. When I return I will no doubt have a horrible experience but when I glance at the marble and the glitz of the advertising my thought would be ""why did they spend the money on this instead of finding a way to eliminate the lines, the traffic, the confusion, the miserable employees, the expensive shops and the the most unwelcome airport ever.",-1,LAX

American Airlines flights to Eugene are out of the American Eagle regional flight​ annex at LAX, which resembles a third-world airport more than a major US facility. These 9 gates are a long bus ride on the tarmac from the main domestic terminal. They might as well be in Long Beach. There is a huge traffic jam getting to and from these flights, with passengers waiting up to 20 minutes to even board a short bus. The annex terminal has few services, with only a small deli for food. They do have a lounge out there, but were not selling day passes that day, due to construction at the lounge in another concourse.

They need more training and made me miss my international flight after my bag was re-scanned 3 times because the bin “was dysfunctioning” and the scanner did not “take a picture.” That occurred multiple times before changing the bin. Then my partner was calling to relay information to the gate, but they would not allow me to even answer my phone which was ringing right in front of me, they treated me like a criminal for wanting to answer my phone.

The nightmare started after I entered the LAX international terminal, The first bad experience was the baggage carousel, which was going to handle my flights luggage, broke down. They waited for 30 minutes before deciding to bring my flights luggage through another carousel. This was putting catching my new connecting flight at risk. I finally got my checked luggage, cleared customs and was directed to the connecting flights area. After another 30 minute wait, my luggage was checked in on a Delta Airlines flight and instead of a boarding pass, given an A4 piece of paper and told curtly to go to terminal 2. At the crowded terminal 2 I was curtly told by terminal 2 staff to use one of the check in kiosks. The kiosk would not accept the information on the sheet of paper. Luckily some Qantas passengers, who were in the same predicament as me found someone who finally gave me my boarding pass. I finally got to the boarding gate with 10 minutes to spare. To sum it up, my main criticism is the baggage carousel breakdown and their refusal to bring our flights luggage through a different one and the unpleasant and impersonal airline staff who treat anybody who is unfamiliar with the terminal like a sheep.",-1,LAX

Eventually an agent rubbed my hands with a cloth and told me to keep moving. I don't understand what that was all about. Next I went into the terminal 8 first class lounge and they wouldn't let me in because they told me it is for international flights only. Seriously? Most flights in that terminal at that time were domestic! I saw people holding boarding passes that said LAX-IAD on them being allowed inside the lounge! There is hardly any good seats in the gate areas. It is always way too loud and hectic in the terminals and the WiFi does not work at all.

Staff are offish and ineffective. My 14 year old daughter was pulled for an immigration check and we nearly missed our connecting flight as we were sat in a waiting room for 2 hours. In that area, 2 people worked running the checks, one person sat on the front desk taking passports and handing them on, another “supervisor” sat and watched the TV and two more (maybe security) wandered around the waiting room occasionally in between sitting down watching TV and napping. One man was told by the lady at the desk to stand by the vending machine, a while later he was shouted at by another staff member for standing there and told to stand in the other corner. He said that’s where he was told to stand so she shouted “well now I’m telling you to stand over there ao you go stand over there” Even if it’s a connecting flight, LAX require all luggage to be picked up and then taken to another area for it to be checked in to the final destination. This makes LAX a poor choice for connecting flights. Toilets very dirty landside but better airside. The security screening is moderately rapid but there are no signs up to explain what should be done (shoes off, liquids in a bag etc) which means it’s mainly managed by staff yelling at the guests - usually with conflicting instructions. We got through OK but some less experienced travellers were left quite flustered. Overall, better than JFK and Newark but worse than any other US airport in my experience.",-1,LAX

",False,"  This airport and the employees here are the worst! We had a connecting flight that we were rushing to make & everyone here seemed to make it as difficult as possible for us along the way. The Southwest agent checking our bags wouldn't let us go ahead even though everyone in line said we could go first because our flight was leaving before theirs. Then comes the lazy, sluggish, rude, and inefficient people at the screening point. They have lines backed up and don't seem to have respect for anyone. When they pulled my backpack for an extra check, they left it sitting there and they slowly went through other people's stuff. When I told them my flight was leaving in 5 minutes, the guy shrugged and said, ""I guess you'll just have to wait"" then proceeded to talk to his colleagues and ignore me. I'm embarrassed this is in America, I'm dumbfounded that people are so blatantly rude, and I'm ashamed of their lack of compassion and common courtesy. Also - the airport is ugly, the layout makes no sense, and things run so poorly here. No wonder they're rude - their jobs must suck. Everything comes back around.",-1,LAX

The experience typically starts with huge traffic jams to reach the terminals and then you get to enjoy some of the worst public transportation facilities. To be fair this review is focused on T3 which is really bad both on the public and airside. There is nothing to enjoy in that terminal. It is old, there is nothing good about it.",-1,LAX

",True," The lines are ridiculously long and inefficient. Employees seem like they are all on their first day of the job. My pregnant wife was berated by a sassy airport employee during her pat-down, and was denigrated for bringing food for the flight. People selected for additional screening were waiting an average of 20 minutes after passing through security just to have someone pawing through their personal effects aimlessly. There was no privacy for the pat-down, which they required for us to bring our baby's food through security. Every time I route through LAX I spend at least 20 extra minutes on the tarmac, and every time I think the same thing: this is the worst airport I have ever flown through. Also, there is no skytrain between terminals, so if you need to transfer between terminals, you also have to pass through security again! Incredibly inefficient-like most of California.",-1,LAX

Have been to many airports in the world but nothing like this mess of a place that is called an international airport. People are treated like sheep because the place has been set up as such. The workers there have to be given a medal each to manage to work in such a place which has no vision of what an airport should resemble.

Although the staff on the ground/coalface/chalkface/in the trenches seemed to be doing their best to be friendly and efficient, the dynamics of the system they are trying to run are apalling!

2017-12-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,the worst experience I have ever had,True," This is the worst experience I have ever had while flying/connecting internationally. And that is after I didn't think my horrible experiences at John F. Kennedy International Airport could ever be surpassed. But they did. At first, I was very pleasantly surprised at the immigration lines. The wait was much less than expected, the terminal is new and beautiful, lots of staff to direct travelers. But then the nightmare started: I was already prepared that my luggage would not make it because of a severe delay in arrival when connecting in Frankfurt, Germany. Frankly, I was completely at ease with that, I didn't mind, it is not the first time this has happened, and I usually pack accordingly. However, for some reason there was a delay in delivering everyone's luggage that did make it, to baggage claim. No biggie, I thought, I had 2.5 hours to connect after clearing immigration! There were multiple announcements overhead where they apologized for the delay in delivering the bags, that there was more luggage waiting to be delivered, and to absolutely not leave without the luggage as it would not be transferred automatically. Meanwhile, 1.5hours later, Aeroflot luggage arrived at the same carousel, not one announcement that the remaining Lufthansa luggage would be taken off the carousel on one end of the thing, or that there would not be anything else coming. I started to get nervous because we were now entering the time frame where I might have trouble connecting to my last leg (approx 45 min to go before departure) and asked for the tenth time, what the plan was. Finally someone found out that there was no further luggage to be had, and to start heading for my connecting gate. Lines through customs were nearly a (felt) mile by now. Luckily I was able to use the much shorter Global Entry lines. Then came the shocker. Since I had no luggage to be rechecked, because it didn't make it, a customer service representative directed me to my connecting flight. ""Leave the terminal and hang a right to Terminal 7"" he said. I left, only to turn around because there were no good signs where terminal 7 even was. He did not offer any further instructions. I started running/walking to Terminal 7. During the 20min it took to get to Terminal 6 there was not one single bus that passed me. I ended up hopping on the bus to take me to the last terminal, because I was running out of steam. And I don't consider myself unfit! Now at Terminal 7, I had to go through security again. Mind you, with all that until now, if I had not been able to take advantage of TSA Precheck, I would not have made my connection because on top of that the gate was the second to last in this Terminal as well. I know of at least 4 more people that would have needed to get on the same plane that did not make it. Never will I do this to myself again.",-1,LAX

Come on - when someone empties the trash cans, please can someone come by and wipe down these desks! It is gross.

I have been stopped on many occasions when going through various security checks, mainly because I have jewellery which bleeps. I've never minded being questioned or having a general pat down, but the procedure I endured at LAX is absolutely beyond comprehension. I am a 72 year old woman, not that that makes any difference, but because of the bleep I was asked to wait in a separate area, and wait I did, for around 25 minutes, I only eventually got someone to do their job when I asked how much longer I would be kept waiting. The young woman advised me that I could go into a private room which I declined, thinking I was just having the ""normal"" pat down, how wrong could I be. It was humilating, legs apart this way, that way, her hands going down and around my waistband, whilst being watched by dozens of travellers. Where is the common sense, has it totally disappeared.

Going through security was the most unpleasant part of our travel experience at Terminal 2. It felt like TSA implements their strictest security checks and most unfriendly customer service for families traveling with little kids and baby food. After clearing security, we proceeded directly to the boarding gate and didn't find any space for us to sit. In contrast, the security agents at London Heathrow were very polite and helpful, and there was ample seating. Overall, I can't recommend LAX T2 for families traveling with little kids.",-1,LAX

I thought my troubles were behind me now that I was returning home on a domestic flight, however I was sorely mistaken. I arrived for a 4.30 am flight at 2.30 am and was unable to check my bag until 3.30 am. The Southwest employees were late and rude. Without adding anything to my bag - their scales showed my checked bag was over by 3 pounds. After that issue was resolved I promptly went through security and off to my gate in terminal 1. About 15 minutes before my flight boarded at 4.15 am the same loud beeping from an inattentive airport employee who left a security gate open again continued until it was my turn to board my flight at 4.45. Now this issue seemed to be with Southwest - but overall all employees are inattentive to their own security rules.

I arrived at 7.30pm last Wednesday on an Air New Zealand flight into Tom Bradley terminal. After clearing the electronic passport readers quite quickly my happiness turned to despair as I was forced to queue through secondary immigration for a further 2 hours. The official asked why I was here and when I replied to stay with my daughter and son in law he asked if I liked my son in law. I was in no mood for banter and ignored his question. He repeated it until I answered. It is like a third world airport with no clocks seating or clearly marked toilet areas. I was so long in immigration that my suitcase had been dumped on the floor next to the carousel. The staff are rude and the experience is enough to put you off using this terminal again.

But, this time the lines for TSA were absolutely horrendous. The worst I have ever experienced. It was a 40 minute wait just to get to the screening area. This is unacceptable. This is mickey mouse. This is not making America great again. They could do a lot better. There were a lot of screening lanes closed. This is simply a lack of budget. This is very poor. Bad management.

The terminal was beautifully decorated for Cinco de Mayo festival. There were plenty of self-serve kiosks and the check-in area was not congested. The TSA security line was also short. After security, the rest of the renovated terminal had a familiar look and feel (nothing that makes you go ""Wow""). I was able to find a place to sit, relax, and utilize the free WiFi by LAX.",1,LAX

I wandered around one of the terminals trying to figure out how to get to my connection in another terminal without leaving. I finally asked security staff at the exit and he was rude and really not interested in helping out. He told me ""I don't know, you're on your way out right?"". When I said that I was trying to connect to another airline, he basically didn't really want to help me but he eventually asked which airline, and he then said ""I don't know"". I got frustrated and told him that I'd ask someone else for the way to the international connections. Nobody there to help at all. Finally fluked out and asked a service counter for help and they pointed me through Gate 22 downstairs and into a lineup for a shuttle. No clear signs, nothing. I then made it to Terminal B, I must've walked around for 30 minutes before I could figure out what's happening because the departures board doesn't say anything beyond a couple hours at a time (my flight is leaving in 3 hours from now). I finally gave up and went to the lounge for my airline and saw a screen listing the gate. About the only thing decent was the overpriced sushi lunch and oh, yeh, I get free internet. I'm not looking forward to my return in a week's time. I guess in this case a 6 hour layover worked out for me - brutal.",-1,LAX

We checked the departure information on their website but this did not show our flight. We asked at least 4 different people who all reassured us that we were in the correct terminal. As the time for our flight drew closer we became more and more anxious. We were advised that there was no information desk. We went to the British Airways desk and they made a call and told us that we were in the wrong terminal and needed to be in terminal 6 (the terminal that we had come into in the first place.

Immigration and customs procedures took approx 1h 55 min! All lugages of French passengers were systematically controlled by customs. It's too long.

Information desk was antiquated with no computer screens in sight, and an equally antiquated staff member bought out some dusty old book with which she retrieved a whole lot of useless information and pointed me in the wrong direction. There was no useful signage for departure / check in, no information on baggage collection apart from one screen with very small writing that was displayed sideways (impossible to read).

The TBIT terminal at LAX is great. On a NY to Sydney run, stopped off there. Good facilities and a great bookstore. Having lounge access makes such a difference. There was a delay to my departure and rather than return to the lounge went to have a look around. Plenty of seating, refreshment areas and stores to stock up on.

2017-07-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,Poor old LAX,False,"  Poor old LAX: the heaving, antiquated, white elephant of US arrival points from the Pacific region. If you repeat to yourself for weeks in advance, ""It's going to take three hours to get out of there"" then, like me, you'll be fair chuffed with 1 hour and 45 minutes (50 minutes to reach the machines that you stick your passport and your fingers into, then another 55 to reach the immigration officer to show him your passport and stick your fingers into his little machine). On the bright side, your baggage has gone around 350 times before being removed by someone and placed at the side of the carousel, so no waiting there (unless someone else has walked off with it). There seems to be some kind of hierarchy, whereby the grumpiest, shoutiest staff welcome you from your plane and scream at you that you're an idiot for not queueing properly (maybe owing to the lack of signage?), the would-rather-be-somewhere-else-but-can-affect-caring-if-I-really-try staff help out at the electronic machines, while the immigration officer at the final desk is pleasant and friendly. Maybe it's a kind of Hunger Games / Battle Royale deal: survive each stage and you get to pass into the U.S. The arrivals terminal (Tom Bradley) is cramped and full, but because it's small it's easy to escape. Not sure I'd fancy transferring from it, though. Not without four hours up my sleeve. It's better than it was ten years ago though, and once you get out into LA's sunshine you can quickly forget it. Tip: arrive here directly from Shanghai Pudong, and you'll at least feel more like a human being than you would if you arrived here from Auckland, Changi, Narita, Hong Kong, Melbourne and Heathrow.",-1,LAX

You climb off your plane after 10 hours from auckland, spend two hours progressing through an unnecessary security process, only to end up back at your plane again ready for another 11 hours to London. We had already been through a very thorough, professional security check in New Zealand. The queues were long and slow. Everyone was annoyed. The fingerprint scan was the final straw. How were they able to get this passed through law? I had not broken any US law, and yet they forced me to provide finger prints, which I am sure they were able to keep on record after I moved on. Where are my rights? Once we made it into the airport terminal we had 20 minutes to buy some food - 15 of which I spent in a queue watching one woman serve a line of 20 people while her manager stood watching. So we made it to the plane hungry, annoyed and sore from walking around. There is no money in the world that would convince me to pass through this airport again.",-1,LAX

Today I came from HND to LAX - the customs line was insanely long and only 1 agent was working. People have connections to make and taking an hour to just get through that line is irresponsible and unacceptable. Following that, every other airport in the world I have passed through has a separate security line for just connection passengers, not at LAX - they actually make you leave the airport and go back through the general security line which today looked to be another hour long wait.

As a frequent flyer out of LAX I appreciate this terminal for not being completely hectic. For those of you who have flown out of Terminal 1 or Terminal B you know how crazy those one can be.

2016-05-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,line for security was so long,False,"  I have traveled throughout the world, through many airports, so in saying that, I want this feedback to be as objective as possible. On April 27th I flew home to Australia from LAX. The line for security was so long, I had to queue through watching many people frustrated as they were held up for flights that were about to board or were boarding. May I make one very useful recommendation? Have a priority queue at security, for all the passengers whose flights are currently boarding. Other airports around the world do this, and have airport staff pointing those quests that are on a flight that is currently boarding, to the priority queue. It works well and efficiently and will eliminate the sudden rush of passengers who are trying to get through the long security line to their flights – which in turn will reduce the amount of delayed flights that are moving out of your airport. As mentioned, this method works in other airports around the world, and I believe can be successfully administered at LAX. Other passengers who have ample time for the security queue will not mind those passengers who are about to miss a flight, to move to a priority queue which is solely for guests who are on a flight that is currently boarding. I understand the budget cuts have affected the airport but this is a simple method that does not require extra staff but is better management of the current staff allocations. I, along with many other quests, were very disappointed at the nonchalant nature of the staff at LAX who showed no sense of urgency, empathy or even concern for those passengers whose flights were about to leave.",-1,LAX

2019-10-12,0.7,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,It was just a bazaar experience,True," Bluegrass is an amazing airport that I have flown into and out of numerously with nothing but positive experiences, until this July, 2019. To start, I'll tell what all I like about Bluegrass. Firstly, pickup, drop-off, and parking are almost a joke, they're so easy! Absolutely no hassle, ever. Secondly, the terminal was fairly modern to begin with even before the remodel about a decade ago, and now it's a ""well-flowing,"" well-organized airport (as if it already wasn't). Thirdly, while there are very few shopping and dining options, and they're really only open during peak traffic volume hours, this is to be expected for such a tiny airport, what options are available are of pretty high quality, plus Dunkin' Donuts (at least last time I checked). Fourthly, baggage claim is efficient even by tiny airport standards. (That said, if nothing is open pre-security, there's a piddly little coffee and hot chocolate machine that doesn't seem to work and when it does, it doesn't seem to work right.) Fifth, personnel from airport check-ins to security, to gate agents to store staff, are usually very friendly, attentive and kind, it's like Bluegrass is a sort of big small town. Sadly, however, when I flew out in July, there was an exception to that friendliness. When I flew out, the TSA Pre-Check line was closed, so I had no choice to go through the regular TSA line. Okay, fine, but the guy who checked my driver's license barely even moved his eyes. The officers at the scanner were more pleasant, but still made me take almost everything out of my backpack, thankfully, I didn't have much to take out, but I don't remember having to empty out so many little details from my bag while flying anywhere around the country or world. It was just a bazaar experience. Thankfully, security are still efficient and the gates are only a 2-3 minute walk from security, so I still made my flight in the nick of time, but that particular experience was just aggravating. Overall, Bluegrass is a fine airport that sets the gold standard for what tiny but very functional airports should be, but I sure wish all of its TSA folks understood the concept of Pre-Check.",1,LEX

There were about 20 people ahead of me but, with 4 stations open to check ID, the line moved quickly. Found myself in a too-slow security lane. People, why do you wait until you get up to the scanner to remove your watch, belt, jewelry, etc. Especially if you're in PRE, you know who this works!

We thought! However our flight to Portland was delayed several times and then cancelled late at night when shops closed. There were elderly people and handicapped people and some medical issues. No assistance was offered. The passengers stuck together and tried to help each other as much as possible. Had to ask for snacks and water but no wheelchairs, no blankets, no directions, just a lot of rudeness. We spent the night on the floor freezing in the airport, then next morning when trying to leave nothing but rudeness everywhere. Security screaming at deaf boy because they wouldn’t calm down long enough to realize or listen to us trying to tell them he was deaf. Eating places the same way.

Some people just skipped the line and went directly outside where they queued with the passengers who had waited for one hour while the other stranded people were inside still waiting. People in wheelchairs were set aside and automatically skipped the line. My wait for a trickling taxi was one hour. When I finally went outside to the next queue the waiting travelers inside had at least a 2 hour wait. The line inside the airport extended way outside the rope lines. People with children or pets were literally in deep trouble. The taxi cabs are not allowed to pick up passengers at the airport curb but are obliged to wait in a parking lot two miles from the airport and then fight traffic to get to curb and pick up a traveler. They make this long circle around the airport. There are hundreds of taxi cabs waiting in the lot. Causing hundreds of stranded travelers waiting for hours inside the airport. I would like to know the genius who created this mess so I could tell him/her what a dumb way to manage the taxi/passenger situation. With all the taxi cabs waiting in the parking lot causing the passengers to wait for hours in the airport instead of a quick turn over like in any other civilized country. It’s a disgrace and mismanagement of available taxis, time, airport disruption due to interminable lines and disgruntled passengers and extra fuel since the driver needs to travel fighting traffic to reach the terminal AGAIN. Besides that, think of the extra burden on the environment and the air we breathe, circling around like that for no reason whatsoever. Taxis are constantly needed, don’t keep them in a parking lot 2 miles from airport trickling in, like slow drops.",-1,LGA

You will have to walk through mud, rain, snow and ice to get in and out of that terminal. There is not even a drop off without having to walk for 5-10 minutes through the complete mess. Once you made it to the ""terminal"", don't expect seating anywhere near the ""gate"". Also, don't expect the plane to be anywhere close to the construction zone that you have to enter to catch a flight. For that, you leave the building and walk and walk through the same weather, mud and rain that you experienced getting into that building. I have no idea why any airline in the world would assume that this was anywhere close to acceptable. Over the last 40 years, I have been flying with poor airlines into poor airports, but this is absolutely the worst and most unbelievable experience. For sure the last time that I flew with Delta Airlines, which is the only airline expecting their customers to accept walking through a muddy construction zone to use their ""service"".

And if you forget, or need to use a restroom after you get to the gate, be prepared to hike back that half mile! Further sadness is the design flaw of the expansive windows. Pretty views, but no overhang and poor window tinting means I left the airport sunburned and sweating from the greenhouse-effect heat! Sunburned from sitting inside an airport? Crazy, but true.

The airport is undergoing a multi billion dollar renovation and is still very much a work in progress. Eating and shopping options are somewhat limited compared to other airports I was at on this trip. I was too tired and hungry to go exploring. There was only one monitor to check for departing flights at the far end of the C concourse. This was frustrating as my departure gate changed twice.

My wife and I arrived at a high-numbered (no letter) gate and saw that we needed to get to gate 'D2'. After looking around in confusion and almost following a sign for D gate departures OUT of the airport, we figured out there was a shuttle between terminals (no signs for it that I saw). After a short walk, we got to a waiting line of shuttle passengers, some of which it sounded like they were waiting many minutes more. Another ten minutes later we were finally got on the shuttle, which took another ten plus minutes to get to our gate. Fortunately we had a reasonably-long layover to work with so we made our flight, another shuttle passenger was not so lucky. Also, at our gate the seating was very poorly laid out and cramped, yay. At least the staff at that gate showed some hustle to get us on the plane which was appreciated, my heart goes out to them.",-1,LGA

They should't take in more flights than they're capable of handling. It took 45 mins to take a shuttle to go 2 terminals over because theres no traffic control for cars/buses.

The concourse of arrival Monday, September 16, for flt 5469 Delta from YUL and departure # 3300 Delta to GRR were awfully uncared for. Several ""cleaners"" were there but not doing their jobs anything more than chatting. It was very disappointing as Delta has certainly lowered the bar for service/customer care.

It took over an hour of us walking around, asking every Delta employee to eventually know where we were to go. The food options were pathetic: almost every stand had the same pre-made sandwiches sitting around for purchase. But the worst of all was the hot serve-your-self options that were placed under heating lamps in the middle of walkways. Passing travelers were free to touch and stir the food trays, but most did not even buy! All I could think about was the massive amount of global germs that would be deposited in each dish! To make matters even more depressing was the pan handle-like atmosphere where airport employees were harassing travelers to sign up for American Express credit cards. Some became indignant when we refused due to time restraints. One told me, “Ahh, come on, you got time, your plane isn’t leaving until 2.00!” Sadly, however, he or no one else, would help us locate our gate. My husband and I had to be detectives and do our own footwork to locate our plane’s eventual arrival gate. Finally, the “icing on the cake” would be the rock-hard stale doughnuts I purchased out of desperation after throwing away my pricey, cold, bland ham and cheese sandwich encased in a soggy roll, layered with smooshed tomatoes and wilted lettuce! Imagine eating that mess of a meal while looking at the horribly stained and filthy grey carpet and praying that you are hopefully at the right gate of departure.

The security check-in line was very long. After over 1 hour they got to the metal detectors and were told the phone or phone scanners were down and told the boys they would need to go get a paper ticket printed. They did this and of course by then the flight had departed. The airline would not help our boys and they are right now stranded in New York. We have scrambled to get them a hotel.

Only scanners were being used at security screening, my wife and I were concerned with harm to our baby, so she tried to opt-out of the scanner to do a pat-down instead. Security staff were immediately demeaning towards her, pushed her to the side of the scanner without offering direction. I had to stand on the other side of security watching helplessly while my pregnant wife was forced to stand in the open, without shoes, for almost 10 minutes until I questioned staff on my side. Employees never gave a clear explanation, and the employee she had initially spoken to just walked off without communicating the opt-out to her co-workers. Any time I questioned staff, they were confrontational and hostile towards me. When my wife finally got a pat down the employee verbally demeaned her, chastised her for not following directions, even though directions were not given. TSA guidelines clearly state that an opt-out of scanners is not meant to punish people, but my pregnant wife was embarrassed and felt like she was being punished. Shame on the security staff for being so ignorant and unprofessional. We will never ever visit this airport again if we can help it.",-1,LGA

One has to wait 30mins to go from Term B to C or D.

Going through security, the clear company was putting 10 and 12 people at a time at the front of the line, the TSA agent had to take his word for who was clear, they had two lines going to the same bin line instead of opening up another one. No one knew if they were supposed to go through metal detector for the scanner so they were getting mad at those in the wrong line, after getting through people were grabbing the wrong bins with the security guard standing there watching and not helping another passenger who had her laptop taken.

2019-06-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,inconvenience and mismanagement,True," My experience at La Guardia was beyond the most horrific I have ever experienced in an impoverished third world country. I have been through airport construction projects in numerous airports and none remotely approached the inconvenience and mismanagement at La Guardia. None, nowhere. Communication was nonexistent or worse, incomprehensible. I will select a few examples from this nightmare just to illustrate. We landed hours late because of weather (to be fair, no fault of the airport). It was almost midnight. We followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs until, finally, at the end of the terminal, far from the usual curbside, we at last found the taxi stand. Or so we thought. The long line waiting for taxi was actually not waiting for taxis at all, but for the bus, to take us to the taxis. Taxis were not allowed at the terminal. So we waited in torrential rain for the bus, which eventually took us to another place where we waited in the rain for a taxi. For our return, I had rented a car and had to drop it off. Unlike any other airport, there were no signs directing you to the rental car return. Fortunately or so I thought I knew my way around. I headed through a maze of construction to the place car dropoffs had been for decades . All but 2 had to move because of the construction. There were no signs or any communications informing you where to go. I asked a police officer, who kindly sent me in the wrong direction. GPS didn’t work. Finally, we found the virtually unmarked dropoff. I asked why there were no signs anywhere directing people to the new dropoffs. He responded, incredibly, that “we are not allowed to have signs off the airport”. We waited for the shuttle bus only to find out that the shuttle bus had to take us to another shuttle bus. During construction, car rental companies, who could not have signs off the airport, were not allowed to have shuttles on the airport. I know construction creates inconvenience, but the experience was a horrific nightmare not an inconvenience and I place full 100% blame on management, customer disregard, and complete incompetence in planning. As the saying goes, only in NY. “",-1,LGA

It takes chaos to help us recognize peace. I lost my phone after I got to the airport this morning, in the security or it fell out of my coat. Rushing up to the security, a few kind New Yorkers working at security helped me ping my iPhone with my Apple Watch, called it, helped me look on the ‘find my phone’ app and even ran my bags through the closed line to see if they could see it on X-ray just to be sure. Just about then the tears starting coming, thinking I couldn’t board my plane and get home. Home sounded pretty darn good about now. All of a sudden the New York hero swoops in holding an I-phone, that suspiciously looks like mine, and proclaims “someone found an I-phone”. I took the phone, uttered a million thank yous. That didn’t seem quite enough and I hugged Mr Hero. Still overcome with gratitude, I threw my hands up in the air and shouted “ I love New Yorkers”.

First off, I have been to much better run airport in most 3rd world countries. They have made somewhat of an attempt to ""modernize"" some terminals, but it still requires catching a shuttle from one terminal to the other, where the transfer station signage is almost as bad as the attitude and organization of the staff who are responsible for running and coordinating the shuttles. I literally missed a connection because of the inefficiency of having to go from one terminal, to the other, and I had 45min to do so. Also gates are often switched at the last minute due to staffing and scheduling issues which forces you onto the archaic shuttle system between terminals. Oh, and also while I was here, a water pipe burst at the entrance to one terminal, which facilitated the need to again bus everyone on said shuttle system to another terminal, just so they can exit the airport.",-1,LGA

The traffic wardens inside the garage appear lost, disoriented and overwhelmed.

2018-11-12,0.8,Business,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,A great convenience,True," The terminals at La Guardia are undergoing a massive makeover - hence the immediate approaches look daunting; it is also outdated in terms of decor and available services. However, this airport, given that it serves the needs of New Yorkers travelling to points east of the Mississippi, and Canada, is extremely convenient. A short taxi ride brings you to the airport. The distance from the entrance to the gates is very, very short. Thus, you save a lot of time. From being dropped off at the entrance gate of the terminal to the TSA check area, it is less than a one minute walk - if you have your boarding pass with you. The gates are immediately thereafter. I am sure once the new terminals are constructed, the walks will be long and I will have to trudge long distances to my gate. I used Terminal B for a United flight from Gate C9. C9 is at the end of the terminal pier. So this is a very convenient, straight forward, quick terminal to use. In less than 5 minutes, including TSA inspection I was at my gate! I did not check any bags. Ample seating and quite a few electric connections to charge your phones all around. At this end, with the large glass windows, not only is the waiting areas bright, thanks to natural light streaming in, you can see flights landing and taking off. I was given TSA pre-check and going through the security inspection was a quick walk in the park. I did not have to pull out my laptop or liquids or even shed my coat or remove my footwear; I had put the phone in my bag. Food stalls after TSA are few but basic snacks and sandwiches are available. A little bit of research before coming to the airport can help travelers prepare for the services available and thus manage expectations. While the airport currently handles more traffic and passengers than it was built for, this is the airport where you can be at your gate from arriving at the terminal in just a few short minutes.

",True," La Guardia is the worst airport I have ever flown into and out of. The airport is extremely mismanaged and lacks quality customer experience. We witnessed an elderly woman who was being assisted by one airport associate drop her 3 bags at the bottom of the escalator and told that she needed to go upstairs but lacked the ability to get all of her bags up the escalator herself. She then had to flag down a police officer to ask another associate to assist her who then loaded her bags and brought them up on the elevator for her as the first associate should have done. The signs throughout the airport contradict each other offering opposite directions for where the public transportation and the uber/Lyft pick up is located.

Can you believe a food court with different places, all owned by the same company, ridiculous. $6 for a slice of pizza. $7 for a bag of candy and a drink. $12 for a small sandwich.

No restaurants for people who want something quick and cheap, and even the stores that sell fast snacks had terrible selection (they don't even sell Doritos). Literally every flight was delayed: we were misinformed multiple times about the extent of our delay, about whether or not we were waiting on another aircraft to arrive or if they were going to use a different aircraft. The WiFi is ridiculously expensive, hence the urge to write a terrible review during your free complimentary 30 minutes of wifi before you are kicked off and forced to pay!

When I flew back in 2014 it was a disaster, 3 years later nothing has changed. When AA took over US Airways they got Terminal C which is where the legacy US Airways routes including flights to Charlotte depart. Terminal C is awful, very small, limited food options and very little seating, the AA side of the terminal is bland while the Delta side is a lot nicer with iPads (with almost no apps) set up. Airport is very very old and very dirty and everything seems to be falling apart. Expect your flight to be delayed out of LGA flight rarely leave LaGuardia on time. Our flight ended up leaving 45 minutes late, check-in was super slow and so was security, most of the staff are completely clueless and have no idea what is going on. When arriving in LaGuardia they gave us the wrong carousel for our bags and after waiting 30 minute we finally found them at a different carousel on the other side of arrivals and the airport staff had absolutely no idea!

Their Spirit flight from Chicago is arriving at least one hour late. I am told the only place to wait for arriving passengers is near baggage claim. There is a woman there, apparently doing nothing, in a kind of uniform wearing a badge reading something like ""passenger assistant"". I ask her where to find an arrivals monitor. She laughs and says: ""there are no such monitors here"". I ask where to find them elsewhere, she says ""there are only departures monitors"". I express my surprise, she keeps laughing and she says ""this is how this airport is right now"". Then I ask her to please find information about Spirit 630, she laughs again and says ""it's impossible"". Then I wander about the airport, finally spotting, on the floor above, an arrivals monitor.

I arrived at La Guardia airport in American / Delta terminal and had to wait 50 minutes to meet my colleague flying in on a separate flight. There is nowhere to sit - period. When I enquired I was told by an airport employee that all seating was taken out due to the homeless population. As a traveler who has paid for a flight into NY that should not become my burden.

The buses are so inconsistent and sporadic at La Guardia that the system is in disarray. Upon our arrival for our first flight the bus we needed was no where to be found. Another bus radioed the correct bus and no answer. He was nice enough to bring us close to our terminal since we waited over 40 minutes. If this driver didn't help us we probably would have missed our flight. Upon our return the same senerio happened- no directions and every employee we asked hadn't a clue. We waited 40 minutes and the driver stops and talked to everyone he knows bringing the trip to retrieve our car close to a hour and 10 min. The airport should institute and educate directions to their employees and have signs for where to go. Airport staff as far as TSA, American Airlines staff and the Hudson news staff were excellent. This isn't our first time parking since construction. Once the parking issue is complete it will be seamless like prior to the construction.",1,LGA

He asked me to move my vehicle twice, even after I told him my friend and her family were walking over from the luggage area outside of the airport. His demeanor and tone were aggressive and he didn't care to listen when I said my friend and her family were approaching the vehicle.

With enough space to accommodate surges. I'll take this airport any day over an Atlanta Delta layover. Clearly a new addition to the Kansas field (did not experience old terminal). Customs/bag claim, re-check, and re-screen for TSA for the domestic leg was super quick. Really like the glass jetways. Friendly TSA and gate agents. Bag claim and TSA were all quite clean. Gate areas were dirty - and not in the post-rush kind of way. Heavy duty cleaning seemed neglected/deferred. One example that stuck out: Dusty and fingerprints on window area/sills, etc. Bathroom sink areas could have received more attention. Some soap dispensers not functioning. A small gripe: Impossible to get a bottled unsweet tea anywhere in the facility. Every retail business had the exact same drinks in their grab and go coolers. My guess is it is contracted out to Pepsico or something. What's the point of having multiple retail businesses if they all serve the same stuff? Overall, I really like the size and style of the facility. Will look forward to my next layover here, should the time come.",1,MCI

The gate seating area only sat 55 passengers. More shops and restaurants, why are there any at all? An airport is not a destination, it's a thoroughfare.

The signage is not great. They must have forgotten about signs for baggage claim because they only have sandwich boards in the main terminal area directing you to the baggage claim. We found NO SIGNS for rental car area. Finally got a broadcast on the PA regarding car rental location and shuttle. The TSA lines were very long even though not many people are here. They had the area roped of as if they were expecting a large crowd and didn't bother to shorten the lanes when not needed causing people to walk more than necessary. The new seats are uncomfortable. Our TSA person at the baggage check area was rude and didn't seem to know the rules for people over 75. I realize it is a work in progress but seems like some of these issues should have been obvious to the designers and planners. Lets hope it gets better as time goes by.,1,MCI
2023-07-06,0.7,Family Leisure,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,modern necessities one would expect,False,"  Feedback on my initial visit to MCI (new terminal). I am a Kansas City native --- this review is critical, as it should be. Overall impression is outstanding compared to the 1970s era terminals. It addresses the needs of a 21st century Midwest airport with all the modern necessities one would expect as a flying customer. First impression walking in, it's big. It spans wide and the design incorporating natural lighting with an abundance of windows is refreshing. The evening sunlight streaming in through different angles really provides a ""non-restricted"" feel as you walk about the terminal. The respective airline check-in counter/placements are easy to identify and span the width of the front end of the terminal for easy access. Security access is fairly streamlined and the entire process is able to accommodate large volumes of travelers (non-TSA airport - VMD corp) more natural light as you progress through each arm of the terminal (A/B/C) with interior lighting not overbearing. The walkways are wide and allow for excellent views of the tarmac, exterior gates, and various angles of the entirety of the taxiways and runways. Additionally, the escalators and walking escalators are positioned nicely and push you through terminal in a speedy manner. More shops, etc. at each terminal branch, providing basically anything the traveler would need. The vibe and local venues are all a welcome addition and definitely fulfill the needs of the traveler. Individual gates and structured well and offer comfortable seating and ample wireless device charging. The one thing that seems odd is the placement of the gate flight monitor(s). It is essentially in the seating area of the individual gates. Why not place it directly behind/above the agent booth/desk for easy and quick access and explanation (poor design decision). Boarding the plane, the traveler is treated to long glass jet bridges that allow for excellent views of adjacent aircraft and outside weather conditions. This is a well thought out design that many major airports do not offer. Overall, the new MCI/KCI terminal is a massive upgrade to the Kansas City area. It has the opportunity for expansion and I would expect future modifications to address design shortfalls and customer feedback. We concluded it feels like a mall when walking though the new terminal. Three things need immediate addressing - (1) Men's restroom upkeep and sanitary conditions unacceptable. Need to revisit the options of installing automatic hand blower machines and look at the cleaning schedules to ensure conditions do not deteriorate to the point of being an embarrassment.  Cleaning crews need to maintain a regular schedule on vacuuming the terminal carpet - paper and debris everywhere.  Please explain how the gate flight monitors are controlled by the city? How is this beneficial to the traveler or airline staff? Local control to change/modify the monitors shouldn't even be a discussion. This new terminal is supposed to represent the pride of Kansas City aviation.",1,MCI

They did not provide enough space to check is thus creating chaos. Confusing lines, no one was helping. For departing passengers using parking shuttle you get down on arrival area then get to upper level to ticketing, only 1 escalator going up and down. If not working you have to carry your check in luggage. very high escalator, did not see option for stairs and minimal number of elevators. Once you check-in getting to your terminal is a long walk not enough moving walkway. Beautiful but not functional, poorly planned new airport. Spent money to make it beautiful but poorly functional. Very inconvenient airport. If I don’t live in Kansas City, will surely avoid this airport.",-1,MCI

We almost missed our transfer flight because doorways exiting terminals were not adequately marked so we had to go through TSA again. Another lady said she had the same experience. TSA people took my reusable water bottle because it was full of water from last airport and would only let me leave airport and pour out. Before all this happened, I went to the restroom, which was shockingly filthy, broken doors, non working towel dispensers, half smashed toilet paper dispensers.",-1,MCI

The airport is broken into a lot of little areas for gates, and of course you can only go behind security in the one serving your airline. It seemed like all of the pre-security restaurants were closed, and in the Delta area there was only one post-security sit down restaurant, which charged an obscene amount of money even by airport standards. The airport itself is poorly lit, with a lot of broken stairs and escalators, and just gave off a depressing vibe. The only good thing is that security was very fast. But overall, this is not an airport where I want to return.",-1,MCI

Yes it has always been small, very outdated and practically no where to eat and shop but tonight when I got off plane about 10.15, it stunk beyond words. Trash was piled high, it smelt like bathroom was clogged up and people were trying to find seating wherever they could. The smell literally made me physically sick to my stomach once I got outside. For someone seeing this as first impression of a beautiful city it missed the mark big time. Come on KC it’s time to take some pride in your airport.",-1,MCI
2022-07-25,0.1,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,This has got to be one of the worst airports,False,"  This has got to be one of the worst airports I have ever been to and believe me I have traveled extensively. From the rude, loud, and verbally abusive TSA agents, the antiquated equipment, slow processing of bags and personnel, and just down right lack of up to date knowledge, this is your first interaction with the Terminal and sets a horrible tone. Then lets move onto the facilities or complete lack thereof. Restrooms are dirty and never maintained or stocked and you have to be skinny, traveling with no bags, and have a lack of smell to even get into and use one if you can find it. Choices for food or drink are limited, outlandishly overpriced (more than other airports), and if you do get anything its stale. Their locations in the dungeon you have to stay at until you board your plane give light to the complete lack of forethought by whomever designed this. Now you need a seat to wait for your plane. That too is horrendous, toxic experience with never enough, and the one I did find to sit in today at SW Gate 43, was sticky and there was a smell coming from the area around me. Decided to stand for the last hour until boarding. I will need to detox everything from my bags to myself before I step foot into my home. Not to mention complete detail my vehicle afterwards. Add to that there are not places to recharge your electronics at your seats like all other airports for your long stay in the cold, dark lifeless tunnels of a terminal unless you crowd around a small area with 1 or 2 outlets, like cows waiting on the evening trough meal. I see they have started a new terminal, but of course the designer there too was either stoned, blind, or has no architectural class whatsoever. And whom ever approved this so called improvement must have pockets lined with gold. You build a beautiful new terminal and then tower a gaudy concrete parking structure in front of it to hide what little majestic magic you were trying to show off. I was once proud to say KC was my home, but if this is the best foot forward you can show to our many visitors, returning Missourians, or International Flyers, then you should be removed. There are two pieces of sunlight that do exist in this total train wreck of an airport. (1) The rental car facility and staff still remain top notch. Whether spending big bucks or trying to save a few I have always be treated with grace, humility, and kindness on the buses, counters, and car parking lots. (2) Gate agents for SW and Delta (only two airlines I use) are always friendly and eager to help in anyway. Kansas City Airport (MCI) you need to seriously look over your customer service, facilities, and architectural managers and make a complete overhaul. Unless this is the look your are going for, draining the customers of all money, life, and happiness at which case you have nailed it.",-1,MCI
2022-07-15,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,the most poorly organized and dirty airport I have ever been in,False,"  This is without a doubt the most poorly organized and dirty airport I have ever been in. Here is a recap of my Kansas City Airport adventure. As the bus from the rental area drops you off at terminal C (American) door C10, you enter the building and can see overhead placards to the left and to the right both listing ticketing and gates. As my flight indicated C84 I headed towards the ticketing to the right. I dragged my bags nearly 1/4 mile around the curved building edge which obstructs your ability to see any distance beyond a hundred feet or so. After 8-9 minutes of walking I stopped dumfounded as the ticketing area that was revealed around the corner was Spirit and Delta. Not American Airlines. I completed an about face and walked all the way back to the C10 door. I double checked my ticket, double checked the sign and sure enough gate c84 was in fact the direction I headed. With no other choice I went the opposite direction and found the American Airlines ticketing center approx 150 yards in the opposite direction of my gate. Needless to say I shared my experience with 3 AA employees one of which was a supervisor. There is old used toilet paper on the ground right inside the terminal as you pass security. The restrooms haven't been cleaned in forever as is evident by the horrible urine stench, puddles of urine on the floor near the urinals, crusted urine stains on the toilets, the garbage is overfilled and used paper towels are spilled over onto the floor. As you walk through the terminal there is garbage on the ground, horribly stained carpet, food debris on most seats and literally piles of what appears to be mud/manure on the floor where someone had scraped their boots in the ground. Pretty sure I found the true origin of Covid. Yup in KCI.",-1,MCI

For people who live in the area, you can currently arrive at economy parking half an hour before your flight boards, take the shuttle to your gate, check in (with or without bags) and still easily make your flight. I have been doing this since 911 slowed things down. The city has embarked on a multi billion dollar new terminal ""upgrade"" to make our beloved airport a clone of larger markets. Long TSA lines, long treks to the gates (now it is about a 2 minute walk from check in to TSA). Separate TSA checkpoints at each cluster of gates means you get through in 5 minutes or so.), We are not a true hub. We don't want a hub. We have plenty of flights and the airlines compete for our business, resulting in lower airfares. The city stopped routine maintenance to strengthen their case for a new terminal. Had they done due diligence, the airport would have looked just fine. But the construction unions held sway and the travelling public here will now be paying increased ticket prices, laden with extra fees to pay for this. A giant step backward.",1,MCI

There is absolutely no reason to treat any person they way the lady treated my son and I at the initial check in. She was wearing ""2"" masks and I could not hear a word she said and my 17 year old son could not understand a word she said either. We are not frequent travelers and this was our fist time at this airport and the lady should have been fired. She was ugly to every person I heard her dealing with. She yelled at all the line telling us there was a ""glare"" in her little box so we need to stand in a certain spot so she could see our face. Just wrong all the way around and customer service was zero, then we go to the line where you take off your shoes and go through that machine. Where do these people come from.

There is nothing here but chairs (with no outlets to charge electronics), seating is located next to security so it is noisy with bins and alarms, no lounges or restaurants just a fast food grab and go thing (Delta gates).

Where to start with a list of what's wrong? First, instead of having access to the entire terminal building as all other airports, travelers are crammed into about 6 gate areas and you cannot leave it without going through security again to get back in. That means you are stuck with limited services unless you want to go through the TSA line again. And what great services are available! Small one-holer bathrooms with 1970s designs that are dirty and smell, too few to accommodate everyone which causes long lines even in the mensroom. Restaurants that close at 7PM when my connecting flight does not depart until 8:25pm. Not enough chairs for everyone to sit. Ancient airline displays with plastic cards vs. modern terminals. I've been to third world countries with airports that are much better! I'll never layover here on a trip again. Southwest, you should be both ashamed & embarrassed that you call this airport a hub! I'll fly other airlines instead of flying through KC. You've lost my business.",-1,MCI
2019-12-29,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,this was my worst airport experience,False,"  The staff at this airport made the decision to not honor passengers with TSA precheck during a very busy holiday weekend. There was no communication indicating this was happening so we got into a very long security line with little time to spare. Then the TSA agent scanned and took both my luggage and backpack aside for an internal inspection of all contents. All of my luggage contents were removed then shoved back into my bags without any findings. Approximately 75% of all passenger bags were inspected without any findings. The security line was so confusing with bags being removed and belongings being removed that people were walking away and leaving their personal belongings at security. In a span of 5 minutes, 3 different TSA agents brought over laptops to the gate agent that people left behind. I also walked away without my laptop then quickly returned to retrieve it. The TSA agents were also very rude and not doing anything to resolve the long lines or chaotic situation! Once we got through the gate I was shocked to see how absolutely dirty the gate areas were, with trash on the ground everywhere and overflowing trash cans! We’ve traveled to this airport for many years and I’ve traveled to many airports in and outside of the US and this was my worst airport experience and I will never return.",-1,MCI

My Uber driver was cussed out by an older woman who was airport security with quite explicit language for trying to merge into the exiting lane. There were no signs and she was not directing traffic, but rather sitting in her car blocking the lane we were in. No biggie, due to us needing to scoot over into the left exiting lane. Just as we were merging, she jumped out of her car and began to profusely scream and swear, demanding we stop. She proceeded to allow every other car pass us and then walked to the back of my Uber drivers car to take his license. She did not come to the car nor give a ticket, so I am not quite sure why the explosive language and looking at the license plate. Her level of professionalism was pitiful and completely uncalled for. It was a poor reflection of her position. The rest of the experience at the Kansas City airport was super friendly and pleasant, as usual. My rating is solely based off of the explosive security woman. I reccomend this airport, but strongly believe someone should address the exiting lanes with class and clarity.",1,MCI

Was randomly selected as usual, then once allowed through I discovered that the gates don't connect. So I had to leave, go through security once again, where I was randomly selected, once again, the ladies ahead of me had to deal with the same thing and were annoyed. The workers there couldn't answer any of the questions they or anyone else had. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the day before, and the part that made me furious is that they threw out my toothpaste saying it wasn't allowed since they don't let you take in liquids over a certain amount, but one of the gate TSA people let a pilot carrying four cups of Starbucks coffee through the security door without hesitation.

Food is worse than the convention center downtown - and that’s saying something. I ordered breakfast and it was honestly a pre-made/pre-cooked plastic-tray goopy mess. Bathrooms are wholly inadequate — and poorly serviced. Pre-packaged food in gate waiting area picked over and poor quality. Gate areas sardine-can crowded.

My first complaint is that my family member and I were separated going through security. As of last Dec. 2017, they now send TSA Pre to a totally different gate for security check. Huh? When I asked one of the agents to explain, he was nasty and said it was easier for employees. I mentioned I didn’t like it. Oddly enough a few minutes later I was patted down for my Apple Watch and a nylon zipper on my pant leg pocket. What? I’ve worn the same pants through security before-no issues.

Finally 30 min later Seattle customers done and all in line are feeling good. Our line was split in 2 and those who had been waiting the longest were in the TSA pre check, which I paid to have too. Then I watched as not only was our line ignored as the pre check, but also as the customers who had been waiting in line the longest.

If you have carry-on only, you can skip the long lines at the ticket counter in hopes of getting into the security line sooner. TSA Pre only recently became an option for AA travelers, and the newly renovated gate area for AA now links all their gates, but it still suffers the same problems that Southwest’s gate area in B does - lack of seating, no clear and direct paths between gates, sparse charging ports (and finding one that actually works is even harder).

This is easily the worst major airport I've ever been to. There are only two restaurants, and both somehow seemed like 1 and 1A for the title of ""Saddest Place on Earth"". When your best food option is a microwaved sandwich from Starbucks, you know you're in a whole new level of suck. Also, for some odd reason, half of the airport is walled off and is inaccessible to the general populous. Why? Good question. This isn't Westeros. I have heard from locals that the airport provides easy in and out access, which could possibly be true. But the fact that this place hasn't been updated since the 70's is incredible, and the shocking lack of restaurants and cleanly bathrooms make Kansas City International seem like the worst major airport in America.",-1,MCI

2017-05-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,3.0,0.0,,,4.0,transfer procedure totally outdated and unacceptable,False," I arrived American Eagle terminal C at Kansas City Airport, and had a departure connection with Alaska Airlines (SkyWest) terminal B. I had to exit the airport, take a shuttle bus and go back through TSA security. The airport was crowded and very confusing. I travel a minimum of 4 times a year and at age 77 I am quite capable of getting around with ease and understand directions. All airport employees, bus drivers, and airline agents were very friendly and helpful in a difficult situation as I had a short connection time. Once I arrived at terminal B, I immediately went to the Alaska Airline customer counter. The agent printed up a new boarding pass with TSA pre-check printed and marked with yellow highlighter. The agent then escorted myself and several others to the TSA check point, and explained to the TSA agent that the plane was in boarding process. The TSA check line was backed up. The agent explained they were not equipped for TSA Precheck and we would go through the routine boarding process. I followed instructions removing my CPAP machine from the original case, before placing it on the screening belt. Removed my shoes, and proceeded through the screen machine. I set it off and explained I was wearing suspenders, I was told to go back, another agent came up saw my suspenders, and politely explained to her co-worker I was wearing suspenders. I was told to go back through the screen machine, of course I set it off again. After lifting my shirt and showing the agent once again the suspenders the agent said put your shirt down (I was wearing a t-shirt under the suspenders) so no skin was showing. Another agent than began the long process of explaining the pat down all the while the plane was boarding. The agent commenced with the pat down process. His pat down was humiliating. Once I boarded the plane several passangers remarked ""they sure gave you tough time"". The work load on TSA would be greatly reduced if MCI Airport could make it so it is not necessary to go through security when changing terminals from one airline to another. The current transfer procedure is totally outdated and unacceptable.",-1,MCI

The circular terminal building was never meant to have the secure area splitting the length of the entire concourse.

Having to go through security just to use the restroom is ridiculous. Talk about deterring people from flying. 1 bathroom ""inside"" the wall to service passengers is bogus.

As a frequent flyer, out of all three terminals, across several carriers, this airport is pathetic. Between the sheer lack of on site parking, the lack of employees that speak English and unimaginably poor ground service, I loathe this place. I will do anything I can to avoid checking a bag because I know I am in for a minimum of a 30 minute wait at baggage claim. That’s on a good day. The wait for a gate to taxi to, the wait for a jet way brought to the plane, then the incredible, inevitable wait at baggage. Carry on only isn’t always an option for me. As one waits, the announcements are made at times only in Spanish, but when they do make it in English, usually secondary to the Spanish, it’s incomprehensible. Listen at any baggage claim, you’ll hear passengers complaining about them. After a ridiculous wait, when you finally get your bag, it’s smash to bits. Every.Single.Time.

They speak harshly to some and are nice to some. Second time departing Orlando and they tell me I have something between my legs. They told me either they feel me all over in front of everyone or they take me to a room to strip down. Mind you I’m traveling with a small child. They really need to learn courtesy and be more polite. Is this how they are being trained? This is the Jet Blue TSA ; one had gray hair and the other had red short hair.

2024-04-16,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,continues to get worse and worse,False,"   I live in Orlando, so use this airport frequently. I don't know what is happening but it continues to get worse and worse. I flew internationally for holiday and returned last evening (April 15th). I left out of Terminal A and returned to Terminal C. I parked in North Lot. Apparently you can take a shuttle from C to the South Lot but not the North Lot. WHY? So I had to take a shuttle to Terminal A to then take another shuttle to my vehicle in North Lot. The shuttle took forever to arrive to C. I saw other shuttles (Mears, off site parking etc) circle two or three times while I waited for the shuttle to take me to A. When it did arrive, me and other other 3 passengers all informed him we were going to A, however he dropped us at Terminal B and told us that was his only stop. So I then had to drag my luggage across the airport to get to Terminal A to catch the next shuttle. That shuttle arrived slightly faster, however the driver didn't even get out of his seat to help any of the passengers board. He just sat there staring at us. A nice passenger helped me load my luggage onboard. I had asked a couple people in the airport how to get where i was going and one girl actually told me ""it wasn't her job to answer that question"". When I did get to my vehicle and went to pay and leave the attendant couldn't have been any more annoyed that I was trying to pay her. She barely could extend her arm to take my payment and seemed severely pissed off she had to actually perform a function. I traveled to three countries and therefore three airports and am sadly embarrassed how our city is represented with regard to our airport. After customs and retrieving my bags, it took me 2 hours to get to my vehicle last night which is horrible. Why is there no shuttle to North Lot from C? Why doesn't the shuttle that is supposed to take you to A not actually take you to A? Why are the workers so rude and unhelpful. Really poor on MCO's part.",-1,MCO

2023-11-08,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,the worst airport experience,False,"  This was the worst airport experience in my life. Very Rude People. Very Few Facilities.  The public announcements were a joke and they were being read like it a joke by a person who sounded about 10 years old. They kept repeating that people are not allowed to use phones in the terminal, and yet looking around guess what, everyone is on their phones because that's what travellers need to do! Being asked to pay $30 for a baggage trolley. (£1 in the UK). Massive queues for the immigration lanes - we waited for over 2 hours. This terminal is very badly designed. No opportunity to purchase any refreshments and no seats. There are no shops whatsoever in the airport on the way to the hire car. (we rented a villa so a shop would have been really handy) Outbound - Similar experience, very few shops and no opportunity to buy any duty free. Encountered extremely rude & cranky TSA operatives. I ended up getting angry myself at the way I was being shouted at and left my iPad/tablet behind. It would have been fine but the tray with this item ended up on a different conveyer belt and I didn't realise I'd left it behind until I was on the flight. To add insult to injury, MCO Lost and Found have said the only option to get my item returned will cost me $349 via UPS. This is an absolute joke as the UPS website quotes me a fraction of this price. The item itself is worth about $150. When you consider MCO auctions thousands of lost electrical items for profit (ggauctionsonline.net), this little operation seems to be lining somebody's pockets at MCO. I had high hopes for this visit but I never dreamt I'd end up being financially exploited by the richest country in the world.",-1,MCO

Could not disembark on arrival as ground crew had a problem with connecting equipment - about 30 minutes extra. Allegedly only ‘one belt’ was working for baggage - waited 2 hours with lack of seating, people lying on the floor etc waiting to get bags. We asked if our elderly parents could go through passport control and get a seat, while we waited for the luggage. We were told yes, this would be fine. Then when our parents attempted to do this they were spoke to in a demeaning tone and said they couldn’t do this. Totally understand that things can go wrong in any industry, but a timely, consistent and courteous approach are some of the best ways of dealing with problems and maintaining or improving customer relationships and experiences.

To get through the line to have baggage checked by security can take very little time but the screening process takes forever if they have to pull your bags. It requires a supervisor who has led feet and all slow the process down and make things annoyingly tedious. There were 4 people in wheelchairs awaiting their baggage for almost a half hour while I and 4 others were also waiting for someone to expedite the process of opening and checking bags.  Service is slow all over, there is nowhere to sit and when you do find a seat it’s covered in crumbs, old turkey and goo from the 1980s. No where to charge your phone or get work done. Not business friendly whatsoever.  No retail spaces to pass the time. Folks sitting on the floors everywhere you look. The only pluses are that’s it’s usually cheap, car rental return is easy and the tram always seems pretty clean. Just get some real seating please.",-1,MCO

Over two hours for baggage to be retrieved on arrival and then an incredibly slow departure from the airport as you pass through customs.

Plain, unadorned beige walls. Shockingly scuffed and marred floors. Crudely finished bathroom floor. Marathon walk to bag claim. It looked like a low bid renovation of a bus terminal. The huge ceiling height and skylights made me wonder about cooling costs. I felt bad for my fellow travelers, walking the long distances after a 10 hour flight, undistracted by color, design, or assistance. I appreciated the airport ambassador who directed us, and the courteous passport control folks.

On arrival we had to go upwards via a sloped incline to arrive at an upper level where a sign indicated how far it was to baggage reclaim (it stated an 8 minute walk). This is not at all accurate for families with small children or for anyone with any sort of mobility issue. There are no moving walkways of any kind or seating prior to arriving into the baggage reclaim area prior to entering immigration/passport control. Our luggage that day took one hour to arrive; this was due to inclement weather and problems with unloading the aircraft. Some of the TSA staff at departures could benefit from more training in customer relations. Airside area is clean and has a few shops and eating places in it prior to arrival at the gate area. Be prepared for a long walk to your flight if your gate for this is at the end of the corridor.,1,MCO

NO working outlets for charging phones or electronics. Restrooms for women require long waits and today was relatively clean, but in the past has not been good at all.

This is the absolute worst airport experience I've ever had, and the absolute worst at MCO. We arrived yesterday at Terminal C from a British Air 9-hour flight. We were met with an uphill incline (and we had baggage with us). We are in our 70s and had to stop several times to catch our breath. Besides the steep incline, this is very antiseptic looking. Once I regained my breathing, I thought to myself that if I were a first-time traveler to the United States, I'd want to turn around and go home. Took a long time to get baggage, but we were on a large plane. Our plane arrived early at 6:25 pm, and our ticket said 6:50 arrival. We had family coming to pick us up, and they had to keep circling around. We left Terminal C around 7:30 pm. Absolutely ridiculous. Worst news for me is that I'm scheduled to fly Icelandair in November, and I'll be dreading that arrival for the next several months. Invest a buck or two, people! Install some escalators!",-1,MCO

From last gate 230 to main hall where most the food is will take you 15-20 minutes to walk there. The upside down nature departures on lower levels, aerials on upper. Constant elevation changes. Don’t know why you would put carpet on the international walkways. Airports have been in operations for a century and designers still can’t figure them out. Oh and don’t forget the walk to train to walk if you are connecting to another airline plan 40 minutes at minimum. Waste of 2.8 billion if you ask me",-1,MCO

I brought carry on so as to keep the trip chaotic free and an attendant that was checking the bags through the device chose to take one of my bags further and took two containers away. One was a gel that was over 3.5 oz. The other was a solid sea salt scrub and he claimed it was a gel and did not look into the container to see the texture of it. You have the scrape the product out with a stick it is so stiff. If that couldn't go on the plane as a carry on why was my deodorant allowed? I feel It was a pure and easy theft. I don't think it's right for one attendant to have the only judgement in order to get away with taking anything they pleases like that.,-1,MCO

Size of terminal, and lack of assisted transportation for those with disabilities. Coordination of rental car agencies. We arrived in terminal C and needed to find transportation back to terminal B. This took about an hour to finally get to our rental vehicle. Should have assigned or made it possible to pick up a car at terminal C. I understand that terminal C opened recently, logistics around the airport should have be planned as the terminal was being built. A lot seems to be after thoughts.",1,MCO

The lines for going through security were impossibly long. That area was clearly understaffed. The monitor claimed it would take 23-25 minutes, but it took us 45 minutes. The waiting area for Delta was filthy. The chairs were disgusting. Many of the chairs were actually broken. There were not enough places for people to sit. The food available was very substandard, and the selection was way too limited. The bathrooms were marginal and unpleasant. Often 2 or 3 announcements were blasting at the same time making it impossible to understands any of them.",-1,MCO

After a 4 hour delay we arrived late, the walk from the gate to the baggage claim is long. Very difficult for even minor mobility issues. There were at least places to stop and rest along the way. It is a very long walk across multiple levels with no moving sidewalks or golf carts. It probably took me 1/2 hour to reach the baggage claim where I waited another hour for the bags. Decided to walk over to the car rental desk to find out where to get the car. Turns out you either have another long walk to take the tram to terminal B or you wait 30 mins for a bus. My flight landed at 10 and I got to my Disney Hotel at 2.00 am. Will be hard pressed to fly any airlines using Terminal C unless they make improvements.",-1,MCO
2023-01-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,Terminal C is horrible,False," Terminal C is horrible. Very poorly designed. The walk from the gate to baggage is so long with no people movers. I use a walker and I know that no one with any kind of mobility issues will be able to walk the half mile to baggage. To get to baggage also requires going up two levels. Yes there are elevators but the buttons are at the end of the bank of 3. I literally pushed the button 3x and the elevator opened and closed before I could reach it. The fourth time I ran and managed to jam my walker into the closing door to get it to open. Signage is also not very clear, but three of us finally figured out how to get to baggage. I was last off the plane, had to wait 10 min for my walker, took 20 min to walk at a decent pace to get to baggage, was directed to the wrong carousel and when I arrived at the correct carousel the bags still were not coming out. There were 5 stops before I finally got my bag over 30 minutes AFTER I reached baggage. From the time we reached the gate until I got my bag, was over 70 minutes! At the VERY LEAST this terminal needs people movers. If you have ANY mobility issues or are even a little out of shape count on 20 min to get to your gate you are almost forced to take a wheelchair even if you normally can navigate with a cane or walker. Terminal C is a nightmare. I hope they correct the problems before I fly Jetblue again. So poorly designed.",-1,MCO

Now with 8 people already at security and a attendant or whatever they call her standing there. My husband who is 80 and suffers from Neurapathy and I am 70 suffers from arthritis we had to walk back and forth back and forth about 6 time. It did not occur to this person to lift the rope for us to go straight ahead as there was nobody else there. I could understand if there was a queue. This Terminal C is not age friendly. The next time we fly Aer Lingus we will have to take a wheel chair that otherwise would not be needed .,-1,MCO

Our trip out was easy enough but our return was a nightmare. We arrived at 8.03 at Terminal C. Had to walk over a 1/2 mile from the gate to baggage claim, up 2 floors to get to baggage claim area. There was no tram cars available to get a ride on. I am 75 yrs old and my wife is 72. We both have to issues walking distances, and needed to stop a few times to carry on. At the baggage claim we didn’t get our bags until 9.00. This is not a terminal to use for the elderly or those who have problems walking.",-1,MCO
2022-11-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,3.0,what happened with the design,False,  Terminal C - what happened with the design of this $2 Billion investment? The parking lot is a nightmare! The arrival hall is on the second floor and the departure on the bottom. Who flipped it on its head? The train station is bigger than average European airport train stations and there are no trains for at least another year and then there will only be a train that goes in one direction to Miami and stops in Cape Canaveral for the cruise connection. Everything in this airport is awkward to say the least. All the food outlets are after security and the multi floor building looks like a greenhouse that lets the sun in - and this in Florida? What about sustainability and eco friendly mess.  I am saddened at the thought of the expense of such an expansion of a major airport that starts of at the wrong foot. It is clear that the designers never traveled abroad and checked in at other airports from Beijing to Singapore or Hong Kong just to mention a few new airports that are inviting and welcoming.  The proof is clearly in the day to day operation: I counted 20 ambassadors helping travelers find their way just from the parking lot to the security area on a regular light travel afternoon. Check it out for yourself!,-1,MCO

First the key code to the jetway was lost so we waited 40+ minutes to get off of the plane. Than you have to walk a half mile to the baggage claim up a maze of walkways that are not friendly to passengers that are ederly or have health issues. Than there were only a few customs agents and 500-600 people trying to get through. Took an hour from plane through customs. Than nobody picks up at C because its to far away so you have to walk another half of a mile to the tram, take it to A or B and then catch your transportation. We could have driven to Fort Lauderdale and flown from there and it would have been faster than traveling terminal C. The desighn is terrible.  I blew out my knee 3 weeks ago and it was just on the mend and now it's re-inflamed. This terminal should be shut down.",-1,MCO

Poor/no road signage, no staff on hand for assistance, no car rentals available, baggage claim woefully inadequate, not allowed to bag drop at terminal instead have to go to terminal A&B and make the long hot outdoor journey from the train to terminal, no trolleys available for transfer to terminal, poor seating, no decent restaurants open, no vending machines, restrooms soaking wet with no hand soap, all staff claim not to work there.

2022-10-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,Absolutely worst TSA service,False,"  Absolutely worst TSA service out of every airport I've ever flown from and/or to. My girlfriend is a diabetic and we were waiting on our connecting flight. I asked 3 different TSA agents whether we would be allowed back through after having to leave out the terminal to even find a vending machine. All 3 said that we could re-enter with no problem. Once we attempted to reenter we were then told that we couldn't and would have to wait until 3am when they could process us because our flight left at 0830. Keep in mind I had already provided connecting flight info to the 3 that I previously asked to avoid having to wait in the long line that will be formed by then. Not a one mentioned that I would have to wait. All 3 told me and my girlfriend that as long as we were back by 12am then we could get through. To make it even better, the night supervisor Alberto was extremely rude and unprofessional and talked to me like I was below him and had a very condescending attitude. I will be directly contacting TSA regarding this and this will be the only time that I ever set foot in this airport again. Any future travel plans to the city of Orlando are hereby gone from my thoughts if this is the quality of service that they provide.",-1,MCO
2022-10-13,0.3,Couple Leisure,1.0,5.0,,4.0,0.0,,1.0,2.0,75 minutes to get through passport control,False,  We landed at the airport and it took over 7 minutes to reach our docking station at Terminal C. We were some of the first off due to the class of ticket we had purchased. We then had a 7 minute walk up hill to reach the baggage claim area. There were 4 such carousels and we waited just under 1 hour to collect out bags. They seemed to arrive just about 10 at a time and then wait more until the next 10 came. We were very lucky as just on other carousel was being used. We then had to wait 75 minutes to get through passport control. The old system allowed you to pass through passport control first so the first class passengers went through first. This also allowed time for the bags to arrive and then you were on your way. Passport control first makes the whole process much faster. We then had to walk a far way to reach the trains to Terminal B in order to pick up our car. We landed at 7.25pm and we drove away just before 10.00pm. Someone needs to look into this as passengers will choose airlines that still arrive at Terminal B.,-1,MCO

Be prepared to walk “7 minutes” (a sign tells you like you’re on the freeway lol) up hill to get to the baggage and customs area. Then be prepared to wait another hour plus to get your luggage, presumably because of the distance. Then wait to catch a bus to terminal B to get a car, etc. It’s not even beautiful. The flooring choice couldn’t have been a cheaper epoxy. I noticed the ceiling tiles in the main baggage hall were already dirty since I had nothing to do while waiting for luggage (you’re not supposed to use your phone in this area). Oh yeah, the LED signs were really nice if you ignore all the wires hanging out from the sloppy installation,",-1,MCO

Gate issue was British airways problem plane in gate had mechanical issues. Now the fun starts, the walk to customs was a long one, elderly will have an issue with the walk time. In the new terminal international flight baggage is sent directly to the customs area. So you are supposed to pickup your bag and go directly to customs. Now this sounds like a great idea but it’s a disaster. After the long walk I hit the baggage claim at 715 pm, another British airways flight on the same baggage carousel and it’s huge. I finally received my bag at 8.25 pm. I believe they are shipping the bags via conveyor from the gate to customs, that is a long haul and it showed. When I left at 8.25pm, 1/3 plane still waiting for their bags. Plane landed at 6.30pm didn’t get home till 10pm with 1/2 hour ride home. If the long conveyor ride for the bags is the problem they have to fix this and quickly, after a 8 hour plus flight you don’t want to wait for a bag for 1.5 hours.",1,MCO

It’s quite a distance to there, and after walking down long corridors, and negotiating various lifts we finally arrived. Before check in there is only one place to get refreshments, and they were terrible. Despite a board showing a variety of coffee, the only offering from the poorly trained staff was plain coffee , given plastic cup and told to fill it myself from a tepid jug. Check in staff also untrained and dismissive, barely polite. Security another nightmare of errors and misscanning. Airside no better, very little choice of refreshments and a vast almost empty area. Again staffed by poorly trained staff. Worst experience ever, how can you open a new facility in such a busy airport, and not have all the training in place. Never again.",-1,MCO

Why pretend to open on time when the terminal was clearly not ready? Clearly the management has no consideration for travelers, nor shows proper management skills.

2022-09-16,0.8,Business,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,3.0,I had an overall good experience,True,"  I had an overall good experience at MCO. While I don't think most airports warrant the reviews they usually get, no airport will ever get a 10/10 rating because the staff are always indifferent, tired, and unfriendly and Orlando is no exception. But they kept everyone moving effectively. Most memorable were the bartenders at the Outback steakhouse in Airside 4. They were in good spirits and seemed eager to be good hosts. The central building was clean and nicely designed. I don't know what it is with Florida airports and monorails, but the system to get you to the gates worked smoothly. The airside building with the gates had a good design because there were lots of amenities in the central part and from there it was 5 minutes or less to any gate. I will warn you that your experience is bound to suck if bad weather causes delays. My flight was delayed 2.5 hours because of a torrential thunderstorm. Orlando is busy because so many small planes are arriving from various places across the country. Delta must have a flight to Atlanta alone every hour. That meant that when the storm ended, the delayed flights were departing at the same time as the flights that hadn't been temporarily diverted. The halls with the gates became extremely crowded and it took almost an hour to takeoff as my flight had to wait in a bloated queue for takeoff.",1,MCO

After waiting in one line (following signs) we were told to move to another line for self baggage check-in, only to then have to move to another line to wait in to actually check our bags as if the airline wants as little customer interaction possible. Staff have been polite but a very standoff-ish, forced polite. We then waited in TSA line for well over an hour although a 24 minute wait was posted, rushed to the gate only to be told, along with about 20 others, that our flight was no longer boarding with no guidance or assistance as to what to do to rectify the situation. We secured an alternative flight home on our own, but the two waiting areas at the gates we sat in while waiting were both infested with ants. This flight, 9 hours later, was eventually delayed by 40 minutes and ultimately over 2 hours. Just issue after issue in an unclean place with unsympathetic sometimes rude workers.",-1,MCO

I have lived in Orlando for 34 years and fly frequently. My entire family, adults with their family flew to Dallas. We got there in plenty of time and went to each park 2 cars in the A/B parking lot. There was no signage stating it was full and had to go to the new terminal C. We entered the garage to be told we had to exit and go to C, which by the way is further and unknown. We left and both have clear to be told by an attendant it was a charge of $1.00. We asked how since you could not provide us parking and also exited as soon as we could. Then we drove to C and each parked. The signage there is terrible and also very isolated. My daughter, 6 year old grand daughter got lost and ended up in a closed parking lot. Finally my son was at shuttle and guided me to the terminal to take the shuttle. By then I was so upset I wanted to cry. We finally got to the main terminal and used clear but my son and family got stuck in the security line. His family thankfully made it only because Spirit was running late. Had it been on time they could have missed their flight. We as a family did our part arriving with ample time. This could have been avoided by letting people now to go only to terminal C. I am sorry but you should not treat anyone like that. Travelling these days has become harder and harder. Don't put more stress on us. We pay a lot to fly with most airlines just awful. I hope this is read by someone that will attempt to make it a better situation. My family has to fly to California in July and honestly we are all dreading it already.",-1,MCO

Our party of 15 came in with time to check in. The hotel should have sent the shuttle about 30 minutes earlier, but we made it to the airport. From there it was chaos and no one was friendly or helpful. I know the staff must be under a lot of stress, but that is no reason to be rude and unhelpful to the passengers who just want to get to their destination. Not all of us want to prove a point, and we all were ok with wearing the proper mask and thought we were following the proper rules. Because of the TSA lines and overkill on patting down passengers and 10 steps in the wrong direction, and a very rude and probably tired official there were 3 out of the 15 who missed the flight and spent the next 29 hours getting home. Because of this there were 3 seats that could have been used by 3 people in need, but used by the 3 of us who needed to get home. Our flight that we should have been on, had 3 empty seats. Because of this action at the airport 3 of us slept in the airport, was witness to a person walking around nude at 3am in the Orlando airport, waited for security to attend to this poor confused person 25 minutes, and had to fly to Dallas and then from there to Madison WI. The rude and overkill with the TSA team slowed down the process even more. There are always two sides to every story.",-1,MCO

They then went back to the check in queue and again approached several members of staff as there was only an hour till their flight left and again were treated very badly by the most unhelpful staff.

A lot of little food places to visit and seating if you need it. However, the TSA staff there is extremely rude. I understand they have to take their jobs seriously however, they do not need to treat us paying travelers like we're pieces of garbage. I'm a young woman traveling alone and I don't need any man talking down to me and you can't even get ""thank you, have a nice day,"" from them. They were extremely rude about the mask I wore and told me to put a real mask on, even though it covered my mouth and nose. The mask I wear is an alternative for my asthma and how I am able to comply with it where it's needed. Meanwhile there were people walking around with none on at all so I don't even want to hear it.

In July of 2021 l visited my son for a week. I flew Frontier from Rochester to Orlando which was just fine but the experience back was less than pleasant. The staff at the airport seemed to be trained in inconsiderate customer service. They’re rude and crude for the most part. I will say that the gentlemen that checked me in at the Frontier counter was very pleasant. He was THE only pleasant employee l experience during my 2 hour stay in the airport. The worst thing l encountered is that airport gate 16 smelled liked urine no matter where stood or sat. I feel that this is the one airport that should be setting an example for our nation since it is the number one vacation destination. Get it together Orlando!

On the way to security checkpoint, 1st TSA encounter: was yelled at while I was with my two young children (to walk shoulder-to-shoulder side by side: difficult to do when 1 child was in a stroller). 2nd encounter near check point was told to scan my tickets with another very rude TSA worker who called me back as I was about to walk to get a body scan, he was upset and had a very mean/annoyed facial expression. Again yelled at: “who are they!” I replied “my children Sir, I scanned my ticket sir”. 3rd Encounter and thankfully the last! I had to dump my sons water from his bottle at a close trash bin (didn’t happen at JFK airport where I’m originally from as the TSA there was friendly and performed a test to check the water, lady smiled and I was on my way). Had to throw away a plastic spray/sip bottle that I was unaware contained approximately 1 ounce of water. I asked if he can just please allow me to dump that water out as well and was told “No, it’s too late” but he let me dump my sons water from his bottle. I was totally confused as I watched him confiscate it. He then checked my sons backpack and took his 4 oz unopened juice box and tossed it! As I said before I was traveling with many other family member and other children who were all able to keep their juice boxes from another TSA worker a different line. Worst experience of my life traveling through Orlando Florida airport! And I’m from NYC.",-1,MCO

We got through the security checks after 30 minutes (what a relief) so our family of 6 decided to use the lounge membership before departure. Our departure is Terminal B gate 35. One of the lounge is located in Terminal B, gate 1-29. We took the tram to the lounge. After finished, we have to take the tram back to tram lobby area (this is the security clearance area after the checkpoint) to take another tram to our gate 35. The TSA employee closed the door and told us we all have to exit and go through security check again, although we have already waited in line and completed the security checks for 6 people. We had only 10 minutes to complete the security checks before our plane boards. The tram for gate 1-29 is the only tram that is separated by ""Exit"" door once the passengers depart the tram lobby area. The logistic of this tram design is so absurd that even though passengers already went through security check, but if you use the lounge (tram 1-29), and have to depart to any other gate, you have to go through security again. Airport Logistics Department need to re-assess this as this will cause passengers to crowd checkpoint lines and miss their flight. Very frustrated that this happened.",-1,MCO

If you can help it at all, do not fly into or out of this airport. We were departing back to Philadelphia from Florida yesterday and arrived at the airport with 2 hours and 45 minutes before our flight. Walked into a line wrapped around the entire one side of the airport wondering what the hell was going on. Turns out it was the security line. There had to be over 600 people in this line, all very disgruntled to say the least. It took us over two hours to get to security. We rushed our things through and ran to catch the shuttle with our shoe laces untied. Luckily got onto the shuttle as the doors were closing and sprinted to our gate from there with about 5 minutes to spare before the doors closed and we missed our flight. The thought of missed our flight only to have to go back to ticketing and returning to that torturous security line again was enough to make us prepare to drive two hours to another airport to fly out of. Despite the fact that we made our frontier flight by a hair, we ended up sitting on the plane for another 30 minutes to wait for the 56 (!!) passengers that were still not present for that was supposed to be a full flight. The airline waited for about half of them to get onto the plane and had to leave the other 20 some passengers behind. This experience alone made an otherwise decent trip a horrible experience that we were left with. I will never ever ever fly into or out of this airport again and urge others to consider the same. Aside from the insane waiting and stressful rushing to our gate, the staff at the airport was very rude and cavalier about the situation. Non apologetic, no concern and just flat out rude. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. On top of everything, we were practically starving for a period of 5 hours since the time we thought we might have to grab a quick bite before our flight was spent stressing in an insane line and frontier doesn’t serve anything on the plan for passengers. I would have rather driven to Florida. Also, I was forced to give this airport one star for some reason, but they deserve negative stars. Steer clear!",-1,MCO

Counter slapped the counter several times, forcefully trying to get me to move up in line. I couldn't because the people in front of me were still moving their bags. I said have a nice day and she said ""whatever"". Shall we start with TSA now? I was being told to step closer by a TSA agent who was farther away. I could not hear them because of the masks. The TSA agent in front of me said, ""hey, Dumbo come get in now, shouted and talked down at me just to stand on the yellow feet and put up my arms.

Then when I told her the lady just said leave the electronics in, one TSA employee says ""I don't know what airport said that to you"". I had enough at this point.

I'm flying for the 2nd time in my life and they huffed and puffed when I asked simple questions. I did not know to get out 4-5 plastic tubs myself for my things, while making sure the grandbaby is still next to me. So they had to help and were very displeased. Then I ask where to find my terminal. The employee rolled his eyes and pointed to the left. I asked if I needed to get on the train. Another employee laughed and asked if I was serious. Yes, in Atlanta you can actually walk to some terminals so I was unsure. Not all people fly all of the time. Have some patience. Treat people with respect and don't assume they know their way around. There were no other passengers anywhere to follow or ask. Sorry I had to interrupt them from socializing with each other, but their rudeness will never be forgotten.",-1,MCO

I fly Delta so I use the B terminal. Well to my dismay and consternation I find no signage telling me where to find Delta. I do see a sign that tells me about all the other airlines in the A terminal. What do you have against Delta?

Airport was fairly empty as expected except apparently a couple of other planes arrived around the same time. Airport security or TSA whomever controls the trams from the gates to the terminal shut down all but 2 tram cars just as 200-250 people were trying to go from gates to the terminal. With all the concern over Covid19 why in the heck would the airport jam all those people into 2 trams. It probably took 2-3 trips back to the terminal to move all the people. We happened to be on the front end of that crowd and once in the tram had no chance to socially distance ourselves from anyone. It was like stuffing sardines into a can. There were 4-6 airport personnel controlling the situation and they all were obvious to any social distancing requirement being imposed for health purposes. It was 11.00 pm which must have been quitting time and they just did what they did every other night when 11.00 pm arrived. Please allow them to understand what is going on in the world today and try to assist in stopping this current virus.

When the lady was telling me to put my feet in the yellow lines I didn’t hear her so she continued to scream it at me. Next my purse gets checked and the man very rudely asks if I have anything in there that will hurt him. I’m a 20 year old white girl I don’t even know how to work a can opener sometimes. Then he pulls out my victoria secret perfume and says this is too big to go through security so I can destroy right here in front of you or you can mail it to yourself. Throws the perfume at me and doesn’t direct me to any kind of ups or anything so eventually I got tired of going in circles and threw my item away. Now I’m sitting here waiting for my plane and crying. Isn’t this supposed to be about customer service? What is the point of being rude to everyone you encounter?

I've had people stand and stare at me waiting in line for coffee, only to tell me 5 minutes later they closed the line. I've been yelled at for not getting in the closest general screening line when there is an obvious general line that is shorter. Today, a security agent squeezed behind me with a cart full of bins, then get mad at me when I accidentally backed up and turned around to apologize (never even had the chance to say anything). Other airports also do a far better job of posting what you can and cannot bring on board, but I've been behind someone in security with full-size shampoo products. The seating area is really dirty today, and the bathrooms are overcrowded. I enjoy Chicago airport. I love Denver. Even LAX is tolerable if you have the right attitude.

I have been to this airport a few times. This is probably the worst airport I have been to. I have travelled to many different cities and countries and gone thru many airports. First, this airport's layout, it is just stupid. They make you go back and forth for no reason and you need to take monorail. The monorail was surprisingly fast and effective. Cleanliness of airport is very questionable. It is not a clean airport. Many places are dirty and the bathroom is Mr Cleans nightmare. I hardly saw any cleaning staff in the airport. What makes this airport the worst is the staff who work in the airport. Many are just rude and lazy. Even the baggage handler thinks he owns the airport. So don’t expect service or courteous here. Most likely you will get yelled at for bothering them. TSA here is joke. I saw 20 TSA, 3 TSA agents working and 17 TSA just standing around talking and laughing. I approached one of TSA to ask question. Her response, “just go over there.” Apparently sharing a joke with her friend is more important than the security of the airport. I thought Newark airport was bad but compared to MCO Newark airport is a well oiled machine. Once again, staff in the airport are what makes this airport the worst airport. Only bright thing about this airport is the immigration agent. Most of them are very professional and courteous. Everyone seems to be trained very well. If possible, avoid this airport.",-1,MCO

To get back to the plane they left and stand by. The official also informed those passengers that they were not going to be processed because the airlines they flew did not file the proper paperwork and they were unexpected! We made it through immigration recovered our checked baggage pleasantly surprised by being given a free cart, rolled through the customs door then told to unload the carts were not allowed to be used to take the luggage anywhere and we were told to place our luggage on the conveyor, told it could take as long as 3 hours to show up at the main portion of the airport. No passengers put there luggage while we were there they all struggled and all helped each other carry their luggage back to the main terminal. Ive been to many Airports across the world. Never have I ran into an additional 3 hour process at the end of customs in any airport at any country. What a waste of big money. why did not the airport let the cart vender rent carts out there rather than spend millions on conveyors that no one will want to use. Also no signs or instructions regarding this portion of the process. It was a melt down just waiting to happen every 10 minutes. They had such a nice appearance when we departed, arriving was a nightmare more than anywere Ive been in 30 years. The staff seemed to try to manage dealing with the ridiculous process.

Arrived at 10 pm on January the 7th from Panama and went directly to immigration line (visitors). Very disappointed to see that there were only 2 agents allocated for our line, while that line for locals had more than 7 agents. As a result it took us more than 1:30h to pass the immigration controls. Then, they took me to the customs office with the excuse of having a common name (they didn't provide more explanations but the way the agent explained didn't sound very convincing, besides it was the first time that it happened to me in US territory). Time spent in the office, 30 minutes. After the office I finally got to pick my lugagge, only to discover that it had to go through a 2nd security check and that we had to pick it in another terminal. Sadly when we got to the pick up terminal, part of the lugagge didn't come out. Nobody from the airport or airline was present to assist us. I asked to another passenger in the same situation and he told me that this messy inconvenient was really normal in the airport. We sat for more than 1 hour besides the belts, until the last bag finally came out. It took me 3 hours to fly from Panama to Orlando and incredibly it took me more than 4 hours to try to go out of the Airport. These guys have no idea of customer experience.

I'm glad we did, because there were few options near our gate. Because we ate first, security was short (it was horribly long before we ate). My biggest issue is that for an international airport at a major tourist destination, it is horribly outdated. For us, specifically, it is a huge lack of charging stations. We were at the gate 15 waiting area. In that area, there were 6 outlets, each with 2 outlets and 2 USB chargers. That makes a total of 24 people who can charge a device. Get with it. Most modern airports (we live in Denver and use DIA regularly, but have seen it at most other parts airports as well) have seats that charge, so every passenger has the opportunity to do so. In this information age, we all use our devices for everything from business, to email, to boarding passes, to transportation (Uber, etc.). We had been gone from our lodging most of the day and arrived with devices in need for charging. Do you have a plan for when a passenger arrives with an electronic boarding pass, but their phone dies before boarding because they couldn't charge it?",-1,MCO

During holiday season travel rush, the airport closed all TSA precheck lines and created massive queues, herding everyone into general security check lines.

We waited over two hours as this airport has done away with special assistance, my wife has muscular dystrophy and is in a wheelchair. We will never again fly into this airport. It’s appalling.

2018-11-14,0.3,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,there is no signage,True," Orlando International has two separate security check points in terminal B that are gate specific. Our boarding pass that we got printed a few minutes prior to going through security didn’t list a gate. Having not been to the airport before we just got into the first check point with our kids and all the carry-ons. It took about 20 minutes before we got to the TSA desk at which time they told us we had to leave and go to the other check point. We then waited in line another 20 minutes to get to the security screening in the second checkpoint line. Our complaint is that first the gate should be printed on the boarding pass as clearly the TSA counter had this information 20 minutes later. Second, there is no signage or employees going around checking to inform travelers they are in the right checkpoint. We all expect some wait at the airport but things like this are simply maddening! Further, when we talked to the TSA folks, they rolled their eyes like this is a very common thing and they wished it wasn’t that way. So my question is this, why isn’t the airport leadership taking this on as an issue to be corrected? Also, the gates for Delta were super crowded! We had to stand the entire time waiting to board, which isn’t easy with small children.",-1,MCO

I was traveling there because my daughter was having surgery so my mind was scattered. Once I landed after flying for 5+ hours, I was ready to catch Uber and get to her house before her surgery early the next morning. As I was taking off an outer coat due to the 40 degree warmer weather, I set my purse down. When I gathered my things as the Uber driver came up, I left my purse on the planter. Of course when we got to her house - no purse. My Uber driver was going back to the airport and offered to see if he could locate it when I gratefully appreciated. My daughter went on line to file a lost and found report. We prayed and moments later, a detective  called. They had been trying to locate me for more than 30 minutes. The Security Guard at the airport found my purse and immediately turned it in. When I spoke to the Detective, I thanked him profusely and asked about next steps. He said Lost and Found would contact me the next morning. They did - twice. They confirmed the contents with me and gave me instructions as to how to pick it up. I told them I would come after my daughter's surgery was over and they understood completely. Around 1pm the next day, I went back to the airport and found them - they were already waiting for me. I asked how I could repay them - tips, writing letters of appreciation or what. They said none of that was necessary and asked how my daughter was. All I can say is how much I truly appreciated their integrity, concern and graciousness. I will highly recommend the Orlando Airport and Orlando in general and a wonderful place to visit!",1,MCO

You have to walk and going up and down to reach your luggages and the parking. Also the staff at security gates (TSA) are not fit to handle customers. They are rude, impolite and unprofessional.

We checked the airport app upon arrival and the estimated wait time for Gates 1-59 security was 6-10 minutes. So we took our time, got some coffee, etc. My wife checked the app again a bit later and suddenly the wait time was 22-26 minutes. We hurried over and discovered the chaos that is MCO security. Several times, several lines merged into one or branched from one line to several. It was like herding cattle. The last time the line branched we apparently chose the wrong line. It just wasn't moving and when we finally got to the front we find that the bag scanner wasn't working properly. All told, it took me 47 minutes to get through security, but it didn't end there for my wife. Her bag was pulled out to be searched, along with a few others'. I went on to the gate to plead with the gate agent because we were about to miss our flight. My wife tells me that the two bags in front of hers were searched because of 1) Disney picture frames, and 2) a hairbrush. For her, it was a handful of quarters. She ran to the tram, then from the tram towards the gate. Luckily I saw her just as the gate agents closed the door. I told them she was on her way and pleaded with them to let us board. They reopened the doors for us and let us on. TSA was rude and condescending, though. I witnessed it myself but my wife tells me it got even worse after I left.

It's like herding cattle. Today I stood on one spot, in a line, for over a half an hour. Once I got to the scanner, the alarm went off. I went back through and it was fine.

",False,"  I have been travelling to Orlando for over 25 years for vacation and work, and over the last 9 months this immigration situation has gone from bad to appalling. You arrive after 9.5 hours in the air to go through a small area with no refreshments or bathroom facilities and then you put your passport into the machines getting a ticket which has cleared you for entry. Once out of this area you are the herded by ill informed rude staff to meet the customs officials and get asked the same questions by these people, some of whom are really nice others can be really obnoxious. So you land at 3.30 pm and get your baggage at 6.00 p.m. Not acceptable. Get this new area sorted get your entry system sorted, get your staff trained in customer service. I have been into dozens of US and other country customs area and this is by far the worse.",-1,MCO

Then, once we deplaned and had our wheelchairs we had to wait additional time before anyone arrived to push us. OIA needs to revaluate their wheelchair service contractor and demand that they hire additional people and buy more wheelchairs. It's a good thing we didn't have a connecting flight or we could have missed it.",1,MCO

First of all I am a frequent flyer and with TSA-Pre Check you can zip through security lines here. The airport is organized and although there is a high amount of passenger traffic everything runs smoothly. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping areas as well as an Apple store which is awesome. The airport is super clean and transportation shuttles are everywhere so you will always get to your gate on time. I have almost never experienced delays at this airport even during international departures. There is also great Wi-Fi through out the whole airport. Customer service and staff are calm and helpful and always cheerful! The only thing I would add to this airport is more international gates to increase international traffic. The overall experience is amazing though, so if you ever fly into Florida I recommend Orlando International Airport!",1,MCO

It is an unfriendly, tired and ill-prepared airport to arrive in. We were held on the plane for 40 minutes because they had no space for us in the arrival halls and then we had to wait in 'holding pens' for a couple of hours in endlessly long snaking queues standing up. Everyone had arrived at that time from long haul flights, so already exhausted. All the children were crying, there were no seats available for those who needed to sit. Nobody wants to spend three hours getting through the airport when they have travelled so far and then need to travel further to their final destination. The ceilings were all coming apart, everything looked very tired and not fit for purpose. Even an apology over the tannoy system would have been appreciated but there was nothing. Only commands to not use your phone or camera. I would avoid this airport at all costs. Plus the signage throughout is terrible!",-1,MCO
2018-07-27,0.4,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,Very tiring airport,True," Arrived at MCO on September 27, departed on October 3, with my wife visiting Disneyland. Very tiring airport, as after arrival have to take a shuttle to reach main terminal and then got to go down a level to collect luggage. Collecting luggage is not the easiest task as there is not enough space to wait around the carousel - tends to be busy most of the time due to Disneyland! Fairly warm as well. Signage there is not as clear as in other airports. Got to ask staff for info most of the time. Most staff are polite and try to help. Similar situation for departure, but signage is a bit better. TSA is much more strenuous than in MIA - put me aside for further check because they ""found something on my clothing"", even though I was wearing just a polo shirt, flip flop no belt and had removed my watch and rings. Then they emptied my carry on and checked my Hersheys chocolate - ""Hugs"", ""Kisses"", etc! An airport that makes you feel tired! I would say avoid it if you can!",-1,MCO
2018-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,passport lines were too long,False,"  On our arrival from Paris, we were kept in the airplane for 50 minutes because, we were told, the passport lines were too long and there was not enough space in the passport/customs entry area. When we were finally let out of the plane, we were taken to a holding area, where we waited for another 20 minutes, and because my wife and I had Global Entry, we were allowed to proceed at that point to the passport area. Goodness knows how much longer the other passengers, visitors and US citizens mixed together had to wait before being let into the passport lines, which were long enough that it would have taken at least two hours total from landing for them to enter the country. Once we got to the Global Entry line there were only two machines, and one was out of service. The one machine available did not operate properly for many of those in the line with us and in my case it failed to recognize that I had Global Entry, even though the passport official we finally got to admitted that we did. A disastrous experience overall and a wonder that any foreign visitors arrive in Orlando or US citizens decide to use MCO as their international gateway. We live in the area but are now considering abandoning nonstop overseas flights from Orlando in favor of other gateways.",-1,MCO

We arrived in Orlando, took around 2 hours to get through immigration with only half of the desks open. We had a family waiting behind us with three young children which included a very young baby. The heat was unbearable, the baby was screaming all the way through, the other children were watching cartoons on their mothers phone in which a security guard told her to put it away as phones were not allowed. The majority of the plane were families with young children and had similar experiences, I had a toddler with me as well. Its an absolutely cruel experience for the little ones. We waited over an hour in a room for our luggage, in which three other flights of people were waiting too. We then had to get a shuttle to the main airport to leave, there was no elevators and I was told by the security guard that I could not go on the escalator with a pram/stroller, I had to drag the pram with a toddler in my arms up the flight of stairs, with two security guards watching happily (I was previously told I would be assisted). A security guard was directing the flock of people through to the shuttle inwhich she had physically pushed my sister in that direction due to it being so over-crowded. In all it took us around 4 hours to get out of the airport, as we waited a silly amount of time to get the rental car out as well. The whole experience was exhausting and cruel, if we decide to visit Orlando again we will definitely be looking at alternative airports.",-1,MCO

",False,"  Well we were warned but wow what a wait! After a long flight into Orlando we disembarked the flight into a corridor and waited and waited and waited. Eventually someone came to get passengers with connecting flights but no explanation. We carried on waiting, the children were tired and thirsty and the corridor was hot. We finally got told that 5 large flights had arrived all at once. I assume this was the schedule and therefore was expected so why could they not either: advise people before they left the plane to be prepared for a wait or have more staff or organise some refreshment in the corridor or even better just advise people of the situation. What was worse was that upon getting the end of the corridor, there was a huge long snaking queue in the customs hall. It took us 3 hours to clear Orlando airport and then we had a 2 hour drive. Never again. I will find another route into South West Florida. Even the Virgin staff looked sympathetic and incredulous at our plight!",-1,MCO

I travel frequently and am forced to fly to Orlando once per year to go to UFL. I always dread this airport and today is no exception. Long lines, fed up security staff, very few services whilst you wait for your flight.

Upon arrival, we were not allowed to disembark the aircraft due to 'congestion in the terminal'. After a 20 minute or so wait, we were allowed off, only to find ourselves queuing in a hot corridor and then a further room for about 50 minutes to get to the machines which have replaced the landing cards. The machines were unmanned with no one on hand to help. It was an absolute shambles. Once we had mastered the machines and taken our printouts, it was into yet another monstrous queue to get through immigration. Orlando airport is an absolute joke. Considering its importance to the tourist industry there, you would expect that there would be investment of some kind to sort it out. Next time, I will fly via one of the hubs which are capable of handling large passenger numbers at an international airport.",-1,MCO

On arrival we were crammed into a tiny waiting area for security screening. Two planes worth all trying to get through the tiny area. It was also hot and stuffy. Once through the security question machines we then had to wait in queues for passport check. The whole airport is terrible and a trip hazard as ita going under works or its falling apart. The signage is poor and you have no idea where you're going especially for car rental. The tram from the terminal to the main terminal was unsafe, such a small waiting area which filled quickly then more people kept coming up the escalator not knowing how full it was had no where to go, it was chaos. It took us over 2 and a half hours to get out of the airport. On departure finding the check in desks was actually fine but more chaos from there. We arrived the 2 hours before checked in straight away then was met by 45 minute wait to get through security, there was no movement at all in any of the queues. It got to the point where I had to go and tell our airline we weren't going to make the flight to which they escorted us through. But even with an escort it was slow. Departure lounge and seating was poor, then the airport had delays so the plane was delayed landing. Thing we will be trying the other airport at Orlando",-1,MCO

Once landed at MSP and at baggage claim his bag wasn’t there.

To start with, the entire process of going through TSA security took 35 minutes. Despite people queuing up all the way into the atrium of the airport, TSA only had a few lines open. One of them was fully staffed but TSA officers were just standing around, laughing and high-fiving each other for several minutes. Then, they allowed a number of people who had only just entered, to proceed to this newly opened line, when everyone else who had been waiting for 15+ minutes were kept waiting. One particular demeaning and nasty TSA individual on a power trip was working the line I went through. As usual, there were no bins to put items in so I waited next to the belt. I was then yelled at ""Why are you standing around, you're holding up the line"". I politely explained that I was waiting for them to restock the bins to which he responded by yelling at me, ""Nobody told you to do that, keep moving. You're holding up the line"". I turned to the passengers behind me, and they looked as apologetic as I did. Another TSA worker then quickly restocked the bins, but the hostility and rudeness of the TSA staff really shocked me. I don't think I will be traveling through this airport again if I can avoid it, and rather attend my meeting as a phone call, or worst case, drive. I know TSA does not employ people for their customer service qualities, but is it necessary to become so hostile to passengers?",-1,MCO

People pushed by saying they were missing a plane. TSA did nothing. Projected wait times said 27 minutes and here it is 1 hour later. To top things off by the time my bag went through the check site, TSA stopped paying attention causing luggage to jam up, fall off and a suitcase flipped my laptop bin, crashing it off conveyor and slamming a hard case suitcase on top.

",True," This by far the worst airport experience I have had in a long time. The staff were doing busy-work but the administration is very poorly organized. Our Southwest flight (outbound in 40 minutes) did not show up on the departure screens and the information booth said they were not aware of any outbound flights to that destination around the given time. Unlike most airports, different gate groupings are not connected to each other, which is fine, but it doesn’t say that explicitly at the security check point. A confusing sign at one of the gates made it seem like it would be OK to go through any checkpoint. Fortunately our e-boarding pass finally updated with the gate number but we were on the wrong side of gate groupings. We had to double back out and make it through the other side.

",False,"  Unpleasant security line experience. We were taking a 6am flight on Sunday and found ourselves in front of a huge line of travelers one hour ahead of the departure time. While it was our problem to not arrive earlier, I approached a mid-aged male staff guiding the traffic, asking if there is an express line for people with less than 30 minutes to departure, so that we can be prepared if we couldn't make it in time. First, upon seeing me approaching, the male staff just turned his back towards me, and I had to address him in the front for him to speak with me, and then instead of pointing me to a panel with waiting time (it was above the security check), he replied ""No, you have to wait in line."" I then asked: ""Do you think I can make it"", he says with such plain tones: ""I don't know, you need to arrive early"". And then he turned his back to me again! It wasn't like there were other people around waiting for his help. Thank goodness that the lady at the entrance (who was super busy) was kind enough to tell us that we can make it and we actually made it. I just think that if you'd like to have tourists coming back, at least be somewhat friendly and stop turning your back!",1,MCO

Took 8 hours to travel 6700 km across the Atlantic and took 2 hours to move though 100 m queue at TSA. International airport it is not. Not sure I would call it an airport. Queue was full of tired elderly and children. Took over 2 hours to get through. Nowhere to sit, no air-conditioning, obvious lack of ""Ambassador' staff. Not the first time. Last time took 3 hours. On top of that you are not allowed to use your mobile in Immigration Hall. Can anyone explain why or is that just some stupid rule from the dark ages. People waiting outside to pick me up then became worried when I hadn't come through even though they could see my flight had landed. Orlando receives over 20 million visitors a year. Airport cannot even cope with two planes arriving at the same time. Just returned from India and got through within 30 mins. They have the same procedures at Immigration control.

On arrival we had to wait inside the plane because no immigration officer was available. Imagine waiting inside the plane after travelling 16 hours non stop from Dubai. I was with my 12 month old twins and family. The immigration opened after 1 hour or so and it took us forever to clear the immigration because there were only 2 or 3 officers available. We were holding our babies with their wet diapers in a long line up for immigration clearance. After clearing the immigration we picked up our luggage from the belt. We had around 8 bags and there was no porter service available. Worst part is once we somehow managed to move our carts outside the immigration and baggage pick up we been told that we have to drop our bags at another belt and take the train which will take us to main arrival halls where we had to pick up our luggage again.

We flew in mid afternoon on a Friday, flight on time. We left the aircraft promptly (should be thankful compared to some) but herded like cattle into a room with no air conditioning, all 455 of us from a 747. There we stayed maybe for 45 mins before moving into the main immigration room with only half of the available desks staffed. The ceiling was falling down and the queues took us all directly beneath the fragile looking ceiling panels. There we queued for another 1hr and a half before progressing to baggage reclaim where despite the time taken so far we still had to wait for our bags. Then we had to go upstairs via an escalator (Staff at bottom ensuring we could be crammed on, young families with their suitcases), so dangerous! Signage seemed ok. We also flew out twice, both domestic flights and a further arrival also domestic within the space of a week. The security queues on outbound flights were about 30 mins long but staff were on hand to make the various lines as quick as possible. Of course we didn't have to suffer the immigration queues and that is their problem. There appear to be new self service immigration consoles in place but weren't in use at that time. Otherwise the airport is in good order lots of food outlets and other shops. Being such a large airport taxi times seemed quite long.

One of the lines breaks into multiple lines but you don't know that when you get in the line. I had 200 people who got in line after me get through secuirty before me. The staff are slow. We had 30 people waiting to go through the screener while our bags had already been checked. Then once through security they block people from going to the tram until the other side exits. A totally inefficient system. Expect long lines, a lot of TSA around but extremely slow. They should take a lesson from Atlanta airport.

2017-11-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,2.0,you can do better Orlando,False,"  
I had a 2-hour layover in Orlando on October 30th which should have been enough time considering I didn’t have any luggage. The plane landed at 5pm, but due to congestion we were not allowed to disembark until 6pm. Since I knew I wasn’t going to have much time, I downloaded the Mobile Passport App to make immigration faster (I had very good experiences with the App in ATL and JFK). However, when I noted to the staff at immigration that I had submitted mine through Mobile Passport, she rudely said that they ""weren't doing that"". Thankfully the line for US citizens was short and I was out of there in 15 minutes. I followed the signs for connecting flights and had to go through security to get to the main gates, which didn’t take long. Unfortunately, when I got the gates and I checked to screens to confirm my gate number, I noticed that my flight was not posted. I asked a friendly staff in the information kiosk and he informed me that I must be at the wrong terminal and I had to take a shuttle to the correct terminal and get out of the airport and go through TSA again. I panicked since it was 6:15pm and my flight was supposed to start boarding at 6:20pm. I arrived at the correct terminal and spoke with a staff member at the exit and she advised that indeed I would have to go through TSA again. When I told her that my flight had started boarding she said “Yeah, you’re definitely going to miss your flight.” Once I arrived at security check I looked for the TSA pre-check line (which I have) but didn’t see it, so asked the person directing everyone in line and I also mentioned that my flight had already started boarding and he said “You’re probably going to miss your flight but just enter here and ask the staff at the front if you can go in the priority line.” When I arrived at the front of the line before the boarding pass check, I asked the staff member if I could go in the priority line since my flight had started boarding and she said “no, sorry!.” I started panicking, so I asked if the fact that I have TSA Pre-Check made a difference and she said “uhm, TSA pre-check is on the other side” and pointed me to it. I rushed over to the TSA pre-check area and was able to complete the security check in 15 minutes, which compared to everything else in this airport, it was a breeze. Finally, the inefficiency of this airport worked to my advantage and although I arrived 5 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off, there were people still boarding the plane. Moral of the story, I just came believe I had so many staff member telling me that I was going to miss my flight, but none tried to do anything about it. I also don’t understand why the TSA pre-check line is so hidden that not even the staff members know where it is. You can do better Orlando.",-1,MCO

",False,"  A shambles of an airport. After a long flight from the UK we were told by the apologetic captain that we were being held on the tarmac due to there being no free gates available to disembark. He mentioned how it was ridiculous that an airport of their size wasn't prepared for our arrival. When we finally disembarked an hour later, we entered the worst immigration queues I have ever had the misfortune of standing in. Two and a half hours it took, in a room with no air conditioning. We had a toddler that didn't understand what was going on and almost collapsed in the heat. No one was offering water or seats, just warnings that phones must be kept in pockets. To add insult to injury we had to endure the constant repeating of the flash entry video about how easy they make immigration. It was inhumane how they treated people, coming into their country to spend a lot of money. Eventually we got to baggage claim where our bags had been removed from the belts and deposited anywhere there was room. Then we were greeted with huge queues at the car rental desks. It may sound sensationalist, but it has honestly put me off travelling to Orlando again. The way out wasn't much better. An hour and a half to get through security on the way out. Staff looked like they didn't care and were rude and arrogant. I'm not sure I understand the idea of all the best shops and restaurants being before the security checks either. You can't spend any time browsing as you don't know how long it's going to take to get through. Once you get through security your choice is severely limited. Can I make one suggestion? Spend some money on the infrastructure and staff. You can't currently meet the demand. Your airport is an absolute shambles and I won't be returning.",-1,MCO

Arrived at this airport and waited an hour to get our luggage in an area with no AC. Why in the world is this airport not up to date? It looks run down and not well kept at all. The airport only has a total of 3 elevators? People make lines and push each other to get into one elevator. Traveled with my husband and 3 daughters to Orlando, Florida. Our youngest daughter only 2, when flying out of MCO the TSA agent checking our tickets was very rude. He was yelling at my husband asking him to move out of the way with an attitude as my husband assisted me with our 2 year old while I was getting my ID to give to the TSA agent. There was no reason for this agent to act this way! These TSA agents are in need of customer service training. They look very unhappy and have a big attitude problem. TSA agents specifically at this airport if you don't like your job find another simple as that. If you like your job then consider looking at these reviews and improve your attitudes towards travelers!

2017-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,This is no way to treat people,False,"  
I can only echo the reviews of everyone else here. This is no way to treat people, especially by a country that is supposedly the most advanced in the world. The slick videos they play in arrivals are the complete opposite to the actual experience. The officer we had was actually pleasant but it takes an age to process each group. The most frustrating thing is that most people coming into MCO are there ultimately to spend a lot of money in the local economy so everything should be done to make the entry process as efficient and welcoming as possible. I for one will never fly into MCO again. Finally, a tip for car renters. Having got through customs over two hours after we landed we then faced the biggest queues ever at the car rental desk in terminal B. Literally two or three people on duty to serve a queue of at least 30 and we all know how long we have to spend at the desk as they try and up sell everything. I went and spoke to one of the other car rental agents as I could see another two hour wait on the horizon, initially to see if I could hire something from them for 24 hours to then come back to collect our pre-pay car the next day. She took me over to Terminal A and said queues are usually much less there than in Terminal B. She was right. One person in front of me and a two hour wait avoided. I told a few beleaguered families at the back of the queue in Terminal B on my return. Always pays to be a fox not a sheep. Don't follow the crowd - look for alternatives.",-1,MCO
2017-07-17,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,3.0,this is woefully inadequate,False,"  I travel internationally at least once a month and being that I live in Brevard County, Florida, I always travel through Orlando International Airport. Since October of 2016, each and every single time I have arrived at Orlando International Airport, the flights have been forced to sit on the tarmac or at the gate because the airport’s immigration service is unable to process more travelers. The wait times have typically been between 30 minutes and 60 minutes. When you finally are allowed to arrive in immigration, you will find that the wait times to pass through immigration are very long (unless you have Global Entry, which I have). Be prepared to spend at least 30 – 45 minutes. Once you finally pass through immigration you will enter into the baggage reclaim area. Note that the international baggage claim has only three baggage carousels. Recognizing that this is woefully inadequate, the airport management assigns teams of workers that rearrange and shuffle baggage as it arrives at each carousel. Of course, eventually the carousels become so overwhelmed with baggage that the workers have to remove the bags and start stacking them about the baggage area wherever there is room. Be aware that your bags may be stored on the floor areas along side the carousel. Again, this is not new or temporary. It has been going on without improvement for a very long time. As you’re waiting for your bags – get ready as this can be very long- I experienced times from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. When you finally do get your luggage you will need to head off to the tram that will take you to the main terminal. If it is not working, which does happen, then be prepared to haul your luggage and kin for a half-mile through hot (and maybe rainy) weather. Of course, the airport will tell you that they will provide a bus if this occurs but realize this is not a speedy exercise. The last bit is the on-going renovations inside the main terminal. Currently (mid 2017) the escalators are sporadically available. If you plan to retrieve your vehicle or rental car from the parking area, be prepared. The elevators (3 in total in any one area) will have a load of passengers waiting to move to one of the three levels. When one finally opens for you, the flood gates open. If you are not standing in front of the one that arrives, you probably won’t make it in. The wonderful feature of these elevators is, as people are scrambling to pack into the elevator that just arrived, the remaining elevators will not attempt a pick-up because the last arriving elevator cancels the selection for your floor. You will have to wait for the filling elevator door to completely close before you can attempt to again summons another elevator. Bottom line, if you are arriving from an international flight (especially with a connection) to MCO then give yourself plenty of time (I would say 3 hours), as it will not be a speedy transit time.",-1,MCO

Holiday to Orlando, 'The Magic Place' well let me tell you MCO if there is one thing you're good at is shattering everyone's dreams the minute they land. Everything is slow. Immigration seem to relish in seeing the queue getting larger and asking dumb questions when you finally get to the desk which took well over 1.5hrs. Having kids ask 'are we nearly there yet' and 'why is it taking so long' when you've run out of answers is exasperating. Then picking luggage up and transfering it to the car hire area rather than carrying / pulling it all which took no more than 10mins on foot meant another 1hr wait for the luggage to arrive with 3 other peoples luggage.

I travel extensively all over the world, however the last time I had to fly via Orlando MCO was thankfully 2003 as it was pretty dreadful even then! I had the opportunity to visit a friend in Fort Myers and the only flight I could get came into Orlando, so I decided to fly and drive. My flight with Virgin Atlantic came in on time and we were all about to disembark when we were told we had to remain on the plane for an additional 30 minutes due to the fact that 'immigration was so busy'! We all waited patiently, and eventually allowed off the plane, just to join an enormous queue for the passport identification machines. Thinking this would speed things along, I waited a further 20 mins and eventually had my passport scanned and photo taken. We then turned the next corner to discover another snaking queue for the passport security check! After waiting a further 30 minutes, I eventually got in front of the Passport Control Security Officer, who I can honestly say was one of the most rude, acerbic and disrespectful men I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. He basically grilled me for around 10-15 minutes on every aspect of my life professional and personal. I eventually picked up my bag from the carousel, in a room with no air conditioning on day with temperature around 89 degrees, just to discover the necessity to join yet another huge snaking queue to show my documents yet again! This took a further 20 minutes and at this point, people were starting to look seriously unwell, with old people looking faint and babies crying non stop. In total this rigmarole took around 2 hours and all before having to get the shuttle to the other terminal in order to queue yet again to pick up my hire car. Unfortunately, I have to travel through the same airport with my children at the end of June and I can honestly say I am absolutely dreading the experience. Not only will it be even hotter then, but due to holidays I'm sure it will be twice as crowded! If they weren't coping with the volume of passengers in May, I really can't see how they will cope during the annual holidays. On the return flight, the security was yet again in total chaos with massive delays and once I got through this unpleasant part of travelling, there was basically only one restaurant which served table dinning; quite unbelievable for an International Airport. There also appeared to be no flight information whatsoever on the flight departures and the only way to get an update was to go to the actual gate. My advice to anyone with the choice, would be to fly into a neighboring airport, even if it's two hours or more away and just drive. I flew into San Francisco International back in March and the experience, could not have been different. The staff were quick, efficient and extremely polite an helpful. The whole process from leaving the aircraft to leaving the terminal was around 30 mins in total. I can therefore only sum up and say I will make sure everyone I know, avoids Orlando International at all costs. Just don't go there and they will have to review their policies.",-1,MCO
2017-06-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,can't cope with the number of travellers,False,"  Orlando is a zoo! Poor signage makes it difficult to navigate, not enough lifts to cope with the numbers, checking and security takes an age and some staff are not helpful and clearly under pressure. The airport can't cope with the number of travellers so I'll help them out by not using Orlando again, ever.",-1,MCO
2017-05-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Welcome to Florida I don't think so,False,"  5th May 2017 flight from Glasgow to Orlando International, scheduled to land at 14.05 landed at 15.15 due to 1hr + delay at Glasgow, then held on the plane for 3+ hrs due to reduce handling capacity in airport then queued for 2.5 hrs for immigration checks, then queued for secondary security checks then pick up hired car and drove out of airport at 21.30. I would not believe this story if someone else told me it. Welcome to Florida I don't think so.",-1,MCO
2017-05-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,the queues were horrendous,False,"  Arrived at about 5.30pm, Fri 5th May on BA 2039. We had then to wait initially an extended 30 mins on the tarmac as the gate was occupied, then at the gate we were told it would be another hour which again was extended before Immigration would let us off the plane. After we were allowed off the queues were horrendous and even after using the APC machines had to queue to see and be questioned by an immigration official also dealing with non machine authorized people. The best welcome from the immigration officer was to tell me that I wasnt allowed to hold my cell phone in my hand, even after telling him it was turned off, and he said I had to put it in my pocket. He even grilled me as to why I was travelling alone but looked sheepish when I told him my wife died tragically 18 months ago, but he didnt manage to say ""Oh I am sorry to hear that"" as most people do, especially after a 9 hr flight and 3 hour unnecessary delay. Then there was a horrendous queue at Customs making it difficult to get bags off and then to get to the exit. Overall I was delayed 3 and half hours from landing, the only consolation was that talking to Virgin and Lufthansa passenger arriving at roughly the same same said they were delayed 4 hours! Can you imagine the pain for about 2000 people arriving and being delayed by an average of 3 hours. What an awful airport, will never fly to MCO directly again, they just cant cope and don't seem to want to welcome people or to help to reduce the delays. Just get audio messages on the hub trains saying what a modern hi tech and progressive city Orlando is, maybe the authors ought to experience what visitors really experience.",-1,MCO
2017-05-01,0.3,Business,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,security setup just plain horrendous,False," Orlando airport is generally fine. Decent food options, easy access from city, good signage and easy to navigate. Unfortunately, both the TSA security setup and the TSA staff is just plain horrendous compared to TSA at all other airports I have ever been to. I'm a frequent traveler. 2-4 flights a month is normal, and sometimes it's a lot more than that. I have been to over 30 airports in the country and I've never seen a TSA setup like this. Lines coming from 2 different, opposite terminal entrances running into each other and then being allowed in one at a time. It's quite bizarre especially given the elegant alternative of just splitting the available security lanes into two - one for each terminal. This creates a lot of blockages and inefficiency as each side is temporarily halted while the other side goes on. The TSA staff only adds to this confusion. Not only are the staff incompetent at this airport, as is evident from their mismanagement of the lines, they are also rude, almost all angry, and very loud and unempathetic. I saw people getting yelled at unnecessarily, being made to wait, being given conflicting instructions and just generally having a bad experience over the course of 2 different departures in the same week from this airport. This is not including my own personal experience where it took 3 agents to resolve the security threat of me having a personal flask of water with...water inside. Instead of being allowed to drain it or drink it, I was sent back outside and forced to go through the entire security process again. My only other option was throwing the flask which was a biryhday gift and which I didn't want to forfeit. Overall, this airportms TSA general manager needs to look into the situation. They are turning what could otherwise be quite a decent airport into a terrible one.",-1,MCO
2017-04-30,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,so painfully slow,False," I have used Orlando Airport in the past and had forgot what arriving here is like. The past couple of times in Florida I have been to SFB and what a pleasure that small airport is in comparison. On to MCO, we arrived on time from London and taxied to our gate, everyone was getting things sorted to disemabark when we're were told the airport could not handle anymore people. We were kept on the plane for 20 minutes before being allowed to leave and that was just the start of the waiting. Queued for the self service machines to scan passports answer questions etc, you then have to queue to do exactly the same thing with a real person so I don't understand the self service machines use? Having finally cleared security we got our bags only to have to put them on another belt to collect in terminal B belt 29 according to screens. Anyway 3 out of 4 bags arrived on belt 28 despite screens saying 29. By the time I got 4th bag from belt 28 and got up to Avis and collected the car it had been over 3 hours since landing. When I used SFB time from leaving aircraft to driving car away was an hour, that's the reason I stopped using MCO as it is so painfully slow.",-1,MCO

This airport has easily the worst baggage delivery times of any airport in the world. I routinely wait up to an hour and have had to wait over that once. I have no idea why every other airport can figure this out and they cannot. Do not check baggage unless you absolutely have to.,-1,MCO
2017-03-29,0.5,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,,,4.0,it would have been chaos,False,"  We were extremely fortunate our plane was the only one landing at this time - and the delay getting through immigration was only one and a half hours. Delays in Miami of up to two and a half hours are not uncommon and I suspect this would have been worse had 2 planes landed at the same time as almost all the immigration booths were manned. The system is even more ridiculously convoluted here than in Miami. You join the ESTA queue for the automatic machines, then join an endless immigration queue where you are quizzed on reason for visit, then you queue for a third time to hand over your automatic ESTA slip at customs. Why this could not be done in queue two is a mystery. As I said, we were lucky. Had more than one plane landed, it would have been chaos. These issues with immigration will soon have a serious effect on America, after a ten hour flight these delays will soon cause people to stop visiting.",-1,MCO

The staff at the security gates were loud and rude. At least two members were shouting out to the hoards of passengers ordering everyone to 'push your own bags through X-ray, they won't move themselves' and 'this is what happens when you don't put your stuff in the box properly' referring to a mobile phone that had fallen on the floor. Going through X-ray was quite frightening. The guard yelled 'forward!' 'Stop!' 'Legs!' 'Arms up!' at me. It honestly felt like I was at an army boot camp! To cap it all, my 71 year old mum was body searched then asked 'have you got anything to declare, are you carrying drugs?' This left her severely shaken. We will not be returning any time soon!

We then had to pass through immigration where, yet again, they took photos and fingerprints. Finally, we had to go through the Department of Agriculture section where our passports were checked again. Whole experience from tarmac to transportation took 3 hours. An absolute joke!",-1,MCO

The staff attempt to be informative while also treating you like an idiot. A woman was placing her bags down to go through the scanner and one of then staff members yells out, ""As you can clearly see, none of this is automatic. You need to PUSH your items down for it to work!"" but a simple ""push your bags down"" would have been sufficient, and less time consuming. This is generally how all information was delivered throughout the process. Otherwise, the staff at the information desk and check in areas were professional and informative, and the airport was easy to navigate.",-1,MCO

2016-07-28,0.5,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,bags never turn up together,False,"  I visit Orlando International (MCO) quite regularly and overall it is a nice airport but it is spoiled by one long term irritation (bag collection) and a more recent one (TSA related). International Arrivals MCO’s international credentials are irritating. Having collected your bags from the carousel and then gone through customs, unless you are travelling lightly you have to give up your bags for transfer to the main terminal building only to have to retrieve them from yet another carousel. Invariably the bags never turn up together and sometimes the time for them to arrive is excessively long. This airport needs a one-stop international arrivals terminal, collect your bags once and go. Departures security on my last few visits, the TSA have spoiled the party. They seem to think that by penning people together before allowing them to pass through the scanners, they are being efficient. Wrong. All this does is succeed in annoying normally mild mannered people who see that they are being processed out of turn. The first TSA person you encounter does not even check boarding passes in correct sequence. We had about 20 people behind us when 2 females just walked to the front of the line and the guy said they are next. It is no use arguing because they are clearly selectively deaf. Do not get me wrong, there are many very pleasant TSA staff and they have a tough job but the whole TSA management structure at MCO need to be re-trained. Last week they did not have the trays ready for the scanner so told everybody to just pass through with minimal checking. Whilst it made the process quicker becuase I did not have to get my laptop out or take my shoes off, their job is to check people properly. They might feel people constantly bash them but most times they deserve it by being stupid. Orlando airport management need to have words with the TSA before they become as bad as Miami airport.",1,MCO

I have seen so many restaurants are closed by 7 or 8 pm. even airports and flights are operating till very late. The second time I been to 5 different restaurants and all had bad attitudes.

I explained that she is legally disabled and we can’t be separated. She insisted. That’s the rules. I was annoyed that she was embarrassing my daughter like that. I said I am using a walker because I have severe back pain. I can’t go stand in those lines. That’s why I have a walker. She said just go over there and cut in the line. So we have to walk against the flow of people to another station. We get there and they’re like what are you doing?

The new security and system for wheelchairs is at a very low level. Customers with ADA accessibility is third-class, they simply are not equipped to handle these travellers. Lines are not clearly marked and wheelchair patrons are left to figure it out on their own. Security is mismanaged, no room for the chair itself. No seating once you get through security to get reset after going through the lines. Additionally, bathrooms are a disaster, no working soap during covid? Who is in charge of operations at Midway, they are not doing the job! No one is cleaning or sanitizing anywhere! Be aware, this management doesn't care, they make it look good in the photos, but actually come here and try to be safe, it's nearly impossible. Why don't the touchless hand sanitizer and towel machines work? Looks like cheap equipment to me, they are either empty or the sensors are poor.

Cramped seating areas, bad/slow food, narrow concourse, few 'walking' escalators, tiny bathrooms, short runways that necessitate abrupt, rough landings, very few (and ludicrously small) flight update boards - these are just a few bullet points on a lengthy list, which comprehensively and easily condemns Midway as the worst major airport in the United States.

I had just gone through the TSA checkpoint when I realized I had left my work binder at the seating area on the way in. I was panicking and I asked a manager in TSA who took his time to walk me back though security and hunted down where I last saw it. There was a gentleman who told us that he saw another member of security take it to baggage claim. He went above and beyond to find the person who took it there and luckily it was descovered. Him and another member were able to get it back to me and I was in much relief. He was then able to help me get back though security so I could make my flight on time.

The new choices are poor in terms of quality. Seating has always been poor as long as I have been flying through Midway. They lost about 20 tables for general seating as they gave it to a single restaurant for expansion. Most of these were empty when I was there on a Friday night. I go though Midway about 10 times a year, but this was the first time I arrived for departure after 8:30 PM. TSA Precheck was closed!

2018-02-23,0.6,Family Leisure,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,lines are frequently long,True," Midway is okay. The airport is relatively clean compared to other American airports and the flights are typically on time and departure gates are easy to find. TSA, without Pre, appears to be a disgrace. The lines are frequently long with only one or two employees checking boarding passes. TSA Pre, however, is easy and extremely quick at Midway. Southwest dominates here, so the check-in process is simple and quick. It seems that on arrival checked baggage arrives extremely late without reason. Lastly, the food is below par and the seating is almost non-existent. But still, Midway's accessibility and gateway to the rest of the US makes the airport tolerable.",1,MDW

Earlier this year, Midway airport had some renovations and changed out many of its long time restaurants. These new changes amount to less options, as well as poor food choices. Many of these changes include Home Run Inn pizzas at the court and at both A and B wings. Likewise they allowed Dunkin Donuts coffee at the court and on both wings (where donuts is the worst kind of breakfast option) Many of the pre-packaged foods along the stands were also reduced to less choices and wilted looking lettuces. Overall the food options are heavy carb load choices and do not offer high quality fresh foods and lack variety. Mayor Emmanuel reportedly eats healthy and the airport eateries are not a place that he would be found dining in as a meal. Disappointed that he and the city allowed these changes to be made.",1,MDW

I now get food before going to the airport every time. Also the wait time at security are getting considerably worse, even for TSA-PRE. I went through last week with a friend who didn't have TSA-PRE, and only two scanners were open. It took 35 min for a short line to get processed. This used to be my airport of choice for convenience and my preference for Southwest Airlines. I will start flying from O'Hare if they continue with the decline. Very unhappy customer!",-1,MDW

This encouraged many people to step out of the long line and walk towards what we thought was precheck. Walked all the way in to learn that is was not precheck. Came out and were told to start the line over again. People were unpleasant and mean. I was able to get back in line to then be accosted by people around me. Please work to ensure this doesn't happen to other travelers. Communication will make or break any organization. This could have been certainly prevented by training all personnel on protocol.

2017-10-09,0.5,Business,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,,,,this restaurant change is a travesty ,False,"  
I have used Midway airport regularly for almost 10 years. The recent change in the available restaurants selection has made it so that I don't eat here anymore. As a frequent flyer who has maintained status for every year of that time, this is a problem. They've removed a convenient, and inexpensive (!) Sandwich restaurant (Potbellys) and replaced it multiple times with a restaurant (Home Run Inn) that costs almost 2x as much for a simple sandwich. On the plus side, the new place appears to have the advantage of being slower also with less professional service. Truth be told, I like Home Run Inn Pizza. It's really good and I recommend you try a slice or two when you're in Chicago. However, pizza is more messy to eat than a sandwich. This is a big concern when you have on the same clothes you are going to attend a business meeting in. I like this airport, it's small, convenient and really easy to get around in. But this restaurant change is a travesty for me and food is a necessity. You've taken the normal routine of mild annoyance that air travel had become and taken it too a much higher level of annoyance. Now, I'm annoyed and hungry. One suggestion, maybe they could install a few more electric plugs. I think these cell phones and computers will catch on.",1,MDW

I give this airport a lot of credit for how they keep the security lines moving fast. One area of suggestion is the useless amounts of trash from the food court. The airport boasts being green but the vendors will give you far more trash then you need. An example is, I went to buy a breakfast sandwich at the Greek place in the food court. They wrapped the sandwich in a sort of wax paper and put it in a small brown paper bag and then put it in a larger paper bag and then put in a fork and a knife and a pile of napkins. I told them a few times that I don't need need the fork, knife and extra bag and they can save I for someone else. So what did he do, he threw it in the garbage. Now, I'm not a crazy tree hugger but this happens every time I eat here. I just think Midway should step up its 'reduce waste' initiative. Thanks!",1,MDW

It is a functional airport with few frills, but it does its job well. The CTA Orange Line provides easy, quick and cheap access to The Loop, another MDW selling-point. TSA pre-check lines were quick, staff courteous too. No complaints about the food offerings before departure: the time passed agreeably in the Windy City Taproom.",1,MDW

Upon my arrival I was quite shocked that the new food options are nothing but expensive and are completely not nutritional whatsoever. At least McDonald's had some healthy choices. Home Run Inn pizza and Dunkin' Donuts appear to be the only food options. Considering the trend has been going in the opposite direction relative to healthy food options, obviously these new vendors were chosen based on how much they are paying in rent. Awful!",-1,MDW

Upon receiving our boarding passes at the kiosk, we noticed a long line of at least 500 passengers waiting to pass through security. The line seemed endless, and we later found out that the airport only had four security checkpoints for over 12 flights scheduled to depart between 6am and 7:30am. When we inquired about the delay, TSA claimed they were not responsible, despite the airline attendant mentioning that TSA's understaffing had been an ongoing issue for morning flights. Due to the long wait, we missed our flight by 11 minutes and were rebooked on a connecting flight to Philly via Charlotte. Shockingly, 70 other passengers (fact) also missed their flight to Charlotte from Memphis. My advice to others is to arrive at least 2 1/2 hours early for flights departing from Memphis. The understaffed TSA seemed indifferent to the chaos, and there were confrontations in the line. Many latecomers appeared distressed, and there was even a member of the Memphis SWAT team present to maintain order before passengers entered the security checkpoint. Good luck! Side note: Huge shout out to Rejoice, the Gate Attendant at American Airlines, for having the patience of a SAINT and getting us on the next connecting flight to Charlotte!",-1,MEM

The airport also tends not to be too crowded but can feel a little tight around the Southwest gates due to their large presence at the airport, but overall the terminal is not very crowded. I have TSA-Pre check and on my last trip through the airport in October of 2018, it probably took less than 2 minutes from when they looked at my boarding pass to when I picked my bag off of the screening belt. Talk about efficient! The parking is also cheap with always plenty of spots available. There is also a small rental car location as well which is more than adequate for an airport of its size. The terminal and the bathrooms are also kept very clean and I've never had too much of a problem. There is also some restaurant variety past the security checkpoint with there being a Starbucks, a sit-down restaurant, Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Hudson News, and a small bakery. Overall, the regional airport is a nice cheaper option rather than going to the congested Boston Logan airport and is super convenient for anyone living in the Seacoast area. The only downfall of the airport is that most flights are going to have to be connecting flights since they only fly to major hub cities and the planes tend to be smaller regional jets so I recommend to bring a very small carry on or just a backpack since it will have to be gate checked when boarding.",1,MHT

One rep on their phone. 2 security lines open. One line jammed up due to having to take a bag off line to check. Waited 15 minutes in the line. Said they were short staffed and didn’t have anyone to check the bag. When we moved over to the next line because the one we were in directed us to, the other rep yelled at us and said she had customers waiting before us. Are we not also her customers that were waiting? She then glared at us and was whispering to another rep about us. Condescending and rude to travelers. They were laughing at people trying to get through, including airline crew and airport staff for being frustrated. This causes anger and frustration and a poor overall mood for passengers when good and positive attitudes would support happy and positive travelers and less issues on airplanes. Embarrassed for this country with international travelers when other countries are kind and calm to travelers because they know it is important for commerce, mental health, and relations with other people.

Due to air traffic my flight got delayed from the departure city. At the arrival due to the same issue it took us awhile to get off the plane. Once out we had to walk miles to get to the passport control area where we found hundreds of people waiting in line. Many of us having a connection flight and there were only a few agents working so because of this a lot of us were late for the connection flight. After this the check point took even longer to get through and once again not enough staff was there working. Also I had to pick up my luggage and drop it for the connection flight something I never had to do with any other airline. We traveled with American Airlines (not recommended) after getting through all of this we had to walk miles again to get to our gate which was at the very end of the hallway only to let us know that we had lost our flight and there was nothing to do other than placing us at a standby list and hope for the best only because it wasn’t the airline fault. According to the American airlines agent this had to do with the controllers and the air traffic so they wouldn’t offer us a hotel room or food just because this was the airport fault. We ended up spending a whole night there where we couldn’t even get a bag of chips because they got rid of vending machines so they have no food options passed 11 pm.

They also broke my bag, however I didn’t have time to file a claim due to the terrible experience. Avoid this airport at all costs!",-1,MIA

When we finally got everything sorted out it was 5:20 and the elevator as well as the escalators didn’t work so my husband had to carry 4 luggage items up 4 flights of stairs. Then the moving escalator to the train also didn’t work. When we got to the terminal the escalator to the ticket counter didn’t work. The security line wait time was 25mins.

2024-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"horrible, dingy, old, awful airport",True,"  If you're a fan of inefficiency and a dash of the cold shoulder,  venturing into MIA is like stepping into a time machine, and not the cool, futuristic kind. It's more akin to a leap backwards into an era where charm and functionality are myths, and cramped, outdated spaces are the harsh reality.  The staff ability to maintain an aura of indifference in the face of any question or plea for help is truly commendable. It's as if they've taken the concept of 'the cold shoulder' and elevated it to an art form. Navigating the airport is akin to participating in an escape room you never signed up for. The layout is so cramped and convoluted. It’s clear the design was inspired by a labyrinth, with a dash of ""let's see how many people we can confuse before noon."" Calling it 'old and dated' is a kindness. It's as if the airport is stuck in a bygone era, stubbornly refusing to join us in the 21st century. The charm of yesteryear has certainly overstayed its welcome here. But the pièce de résistance has to be the TSA security clearance - a spectacle so inefficient and embarrassing, it deserves its own reality TV show. The TSA staff, not wanting to be outdone by their airport colleagues, take rudeness to new heights, skirting the line of abusiveness with a finesse that would make a drill sergeant blush. It's a process so fraught with frustration, you'd think it was designed as a test of human endurance. In an era where digital connectivity is akin to oxygen, MIA somehow manages to turn free WiFi into a luxury item. Thanks to the generosity of American Express, passengers can access the internet, provided they have the patience to sit through ads. It's a charming reminder of the dial-up era, a nostalgic throwback that no one asked for. The concept of passenger experience seems to be an alien one at MIA. From the lack of food outlets to the scarcity of lounges, it's as if they're pioneering a new minimalist approach to airport amenities - less is more, and in the case of MIA, much less. In conclusion, if you're seeking an airport experience that combines the charm of a Soviet-era bus station with the efficiency of a sloth, look no further than Miami International Airport. It's an adventure you won't forget, no matter how hard you try. I wholeheartedly advise anyone to avoid this horrible, dingy, old, awful airport at all costs. It's truly a masterclass in how not to run an airport.",-1,MIA

We have travelled over 10 times and going through Miami on an international flight is by far going to be your worst experience. Do not go through with a short connection.

2024-01-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,3.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,My experience was terrible,False,"  My experience at this airport was terrible. I was connecting through Miami in a flight to Barcelona (Spain). The connection was quite short (90 mins) due to an earlier delay in the first flight. The lines for passport control were massive, I have never seen anything like it, so I asked the staff if there was a priority line for connections and emphasised my short connection. After a bit of confusion and me having done most of the regular line, eventually someone came and handed us the orange cards and we went into a separate queue. The short connection queue was still quite long, so I requested one of the staff if he could organise it prioritising those with flights leaving earliest, like my own. I was understandably quite nervous about missing my flight, as I was travelling with my mother, a senior with a disability. The gentleman said he couldn’t do anything and that I had to wait, I insisted that the system was making little sense but was in no way disrespectful. Another passenger was allowed to go to the front of the queue however, which I thought was unfair particularly to me as I was the one with the earliest flight. I also can’t understand as a key international hub there isn’t any organisation whatsoever to connecting flights",-1,MIA

It took us about an hour to go through the security checkpoint and we missed our flight. We have to stay an extra day at Miami and we missed our family gathering for New Year’s Eve. The airport design is so poor, if you went to the gate A-D and you want to go to gate E or F, you have to come out completely and redo the security check. So if your gate is at E or F, you can’t enjoy the priority lounge which locates at gate D. The security staff asked us to check in our prepaid carryon luggage as she thinks it is bigger than the standard size although we measure the size at home and it fits the measurements of the allowed carryon according to the airline instructions. So combined with the worst airline the Frontier our vacation is ruined although Miami is a beautiful city, we don’t want to come back.",-1,MIA

A two hour wait in stifling heat, shuffling forwards to an area where just 6 booths were in operation to take account of the thousands of people arriving no water or seating provided. After dealing with COVID and all of its implications Miami has learnt nothing and appeared to move at a pace that was unable or unwilling to respond to the numbers amassing. I can honestly say that I will never fly through here again and I can only pass this information on to those yet to experience it.",-1,MIA

This made us late to our connecting flight, since the gate for that was about a mile away and this skytrain was broken, which I understand is as usual. I can’t walk that far and was so exhausted after clearing passport control, US customs, TSA, and then getting to the faraway gate. My American Airlines rep was not overly helpful or friendly either.

The queuing is poorly organized to the extent that you have to queue to enter the main queue, but as nothing is organized, there are loads of people milling all over the place. The immigration officer, once we got to the front of the queue was pleasant and friendly enough, but looked as though she had seen enough for the day too. Oh and of course only about half the booths were manned. Remember that immigration is the first thing that visitors see when they arrive in the USA.

You had to walk miles because the skytrain was broken. Based on earlier reviews this has been the case for a long time. Asked people for directions to rental cars and nobody was able to help. Information desk or better signs would be useful. Avoid this airport if you can and Uber/Lyft rather than renting a car which was a separate disaster.,-1,MIA

The airports ""SkyTrain"" was not operational, and they had limited number of carts to help those in need. I am 73 years old but having to walk from baggage check-in (around gate 20) to gate 45 was not a pleasant experience. According to a friend, the Skytrain has been broken for about 6 months. I only witnessed two golf carts for seniors while walking about a half mile to my gate. Deplorable. To make matters worse, there was one section where the AC was broken. You think they would contract with a vendor to provide golf cart service above their normal service if the SkyTrain was out of order. My arrival was almost worse with a 1/2 to 3/4 mile walk with NO CARTS and NOT ONE OPERATIONAL PEOPLE MOVER (flat escalator). Try to avoid this airport at all costs, especially if you are elderly.

Poor signage (DFW successfully redid all of their signs a few years ago). We were directed in the wrong direction several times. Asking employees for directions was no help because they did not know where baggage claim 6 was either.  Poor maintenance - Most elevators were out of service, and had apparently been so for months or years, since the signs directing you to the next working elevators were ragged and worn.  Restrooms not serviced - no paper towels or air dryers. Transportation services not available - the train was not operable; the golf carts were sitting unused with no driver. This was in Terminal D which is almost a mile long. When we arrived on an international flight we had an extremely long walk to customs and there were no chairs in which to rest.  There were unreasonably long distances to walk to immigration and customs - sometimes the signs sent domestic and international passengers in different directions, only for them to join again. The signs indicating which line to get in were confusing - we saw dozens of people being moved from one line to another.  It was very difficult to find hotel shuttles, and they are located in a dark area across several roads from the terminal. The electrical outlets in our seats had no power.  The entire design of the airport appeared to be by an architect who specializes in corn mazes.",-1,MIA

Restrooms need maintenance, the acoustics throughout are poor and transportation is either non existent or impaired. My flight had a gate change at the last minute. The gates were about a football field apart. I hitched a ride on one of many wheel chairs, but got off soon as woman was suggesting she expected a tip. The security was unorganized, crowded. Management needs a good management system. It's done at other airports in Florida, successfully. The whole airport looks like it has patchwork construction and design, archaic layout. Wheelchairs and transport buses running where people walk! Gate signs don't make sense. I had to ask people where to find everything. Loud speaker sometimes can't be heard, sometimes loud. Terrible!! Where is our tax payer money going. It's certainly not going to this place. Governor DeSantis needs to overhaul the management.

I arrived somewhere in Miami Terminal E after a horrid BA flight, walked for 20 minutes to the Immigration Area where I waited an hour before my turn came and then I walked some 30 minutes to a lounge at D 30 and then had to take a small train to the gate. I do not mind the walking if there are the electric walking lanes that are working but the standing in lines is a strain. - I have occasionally used a wheelchair but these are often promised but do not arrive. My other problem was going through security at Miami where I was told to keep my shoes on although I have artificial knees but then the person at the screening told me to take them off which is more difficult than the young may imagine.",-1,MIA

When arriving in Miami the customs line was a mile long - no exaggeration - I have video and photo. There were maybe a handful of officers to handle customs and thousands of passengers. We missed our connection. From standing in line for 2 hours. Then after getting baggage another line to leave so add another hour because 1 man was letting people out. Then a line of 550 feet to get vouchers from American Airlines. We did not wait because was already 10:30pm. No employees here to assist thousands of people. Same experience this morning. Stood in two huge lines to check in and get through security due to few employees working. Now we arrive at our gate, and not even half enough seats to sit in to wait. Meanwhile, remodeling is furiously happening. Perhaps Miami airport should hire people to work rather than remodel right now. Complete inept and terrible customer service.",-1,MIA

I asked the single officer on duty. He had no idea. There was no there to assist passengers, only a pair of women behind a booth selling phone cards. The lack of signage or any personnel to guide passengers is shocking, and makes me think that Miami Airport has worse service (and security protocols) than airports in less developed nations.

My flight from Dallas Love Field arrived in the G Concourse which reminds me of the old New York LaGuardia terminal. Low ceilings, narrow walkways, dirty, dark, interior. I made my way to ground transportation which was a nightmare. The signage is confusing and with the proliferation of ride share apps like Uber, Lyft, etc., one would think there would be ample signage. The entire ground transportation area is confusing, with inadequate signage. Then, there are the airport staff. I had trouble getting a Lyft, and decided to take a cab. The cab driver told me that since I was going to Hilton Airport Blue Lagoon, I had to take a “blue” taxi. I asked an airport ground transportation worker for directions and he pointed and said, “at the end.” I never found the blue taxi and finally ended up waiting for my hotel’s courtesy van for another 30 minutes.  Upon arrival back to the airport for my departing flight, the same chaos ensued. I arrived at the airport at 8:00 a.m. for my 11:55 a.m. flight back to Dallas. Since I had time to spare, I went to the Star Alliance Lounge between H and J. Security checkpoint was horrible. Crowded, confusing, and I was in the line for the TSA Pre-Check which they were merging with the CLEAR and general security screening. Employees are brash, if not just downright rude. The walkway between H and J was much nicer; except for the restrooms. Wow - I think they imported these from old gas stations. Dark, dirty, in disrepair. I finally made my way to the Star Alliance Lounge. The entrance to the elevator from the concourse level is two double doors that made me think I was going into the back kitchen of an old diner. Followed, by a dirty elevator with taped signage directing me to the lounge. The walk from the elevator to the lounge entrance made me think I was in the wrong place, but I kept walking and eventually found it. Finally a nice escape from the worst airport I’ve ever experienced.",-1,MIA

It seems as though we are interrupting their conversation when we pose a question or offer advice. For the same reason, the customer support is nonexistent. The coffee served at the terminal is bitter, of poor quality, and overly priced for subpar coffee. At 7 a.m., the airport's tables were already dirty, and people were chit-chatting in their coffee shops rather than cleaning them. I assume that even though people work and are paid to help others, the interruption of their conversation to answer questions or offer advice causes them inconvenience.

My wife and I flew into Miami from the Caribbean, where we were connecting to a flight back to our home in San Diego. Getting through Customs with our Global Entry status was a breeze. But then MIA put all connecting international passengers into one gigantic line to get through security. There was no TSA PreCheck. The line was agonizingly slow. When we finally cleared security, we had to sprint more than 30 gates to get to our connecting flight. We made it with just a few minutes to spare. When I later emailed a complaint into TSA, I received an automated response. I have never been to any other U.S. airport that didn't offer PreCheck. That a major airport like MIA doesn't offer the service is inexcusable. If you're connecting internationally, avoid this airport if you can.",-1,MIA

Second, the sky tram was down, a long walk to immigration check in with heavy bags, no offered assistance. Then we are put in one line which isn't moving, so they shuffle us to the other end, more chaos, more time. I had to go through security 3x. First I waited in line to be told I had to check my roller bag. 2nd time in line my backpack goes thru the scanner, keeping in mind this is the 8th flight in 2 weeks with no previous issues, and TSA decides my $70 hiking sticks are an issue. Back to AA counter to check the sticks, no guarantees they'll make it, no guarantee they will replace them if lost.

Since stepping off the aircraft to bags being in baggage claim was roughly 45min-1 hour. Now I flew American Airlines, which actually never took my bag off the flight so my bags ended up being sent to Vegas. I know that the problem is more with American Airlines and not the airport, but when trying to get help on where to go and who to talk to I was met with great resistance. No one wanted to help and after spending over four hours trying to find where my bag was I eventually left and gave up. The workers in the airport were incompetent. I never once raised my voice or had an angry attitude towards a worker, because I know that it’s not their fault that my bags were lost. However, I waited in baggage claim line for 45min waiting to get an answer on where my bag was. When I got to the front, the associate refused to scan my baggage slip and told me to go look in a pile of bags I already looked through. After telling the associate I had already gone through all the bags with other associates she just waived her hand at me to leave. The airport layout is horrendous and it feels like a run down mall instead of an airport. Everything is dirty and the seat availability is absolutely slim. There is very little seating for people who have to wait for flights. Even on a day with little to no delays you find yourself either shoulder to shoulder with someone or sitting on the floor. On my departure trip back to the airport I arrived, come to find out instead of holding my bag they lost for me to recheck, they sent it on a flight back to Dallas after we had already discussed over the phone I would pick it up myself in Miami. I got to the airport at approximately 8:30am and my flight didn’t board until 3:00pm. Since I was coming from a cruise I didn’t have much option but to wait in the airport. Since I entered the terminal there was a loud alarm that stated “may we have your attention”, “the current alarm in being investigated by the fire department, please standby for more instructions.” This alarm continued to go off every minute even after I got on my flight to leave. I understand the safety of having alarms, but it sounded like it had been going off for days. Seating was again slim and the restrooms were absolutely disastrous. Overall, if you plan on spending anytime at all at an airport make sure it is not in Miami. For an international airport I am shocked at how horrendous the experience is. The service and associates around the airport treat people nothing more than a ticket. 1/10 I am never coming back to this airport, I would rather spend hundreds of more dollars than spend another minute here.",-1,MIA

Today Jan 9, 2023, around 500 people (and the line kept getting longer) were in line at the US citizens passport control an only TWO agents were working. Absolutely insane. I had a connecting flight and security check was a madhouse on top of that the TSA agent with whom I dealt yelled and yelled at people. I asked her not to yell and she yelled back at me. And she kept yelling. Disgustingly unprofessional behavior. This airport’s service has gone from bad to worse.",-1,MIA

2022-12-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,2.0,chaos referred to as the Miami Airport,False,"  There is no possible way to accurately describe the chaos referred to as the Miami Airport. If one is an international flier arriving at this airport, the chaos begins with trying to secure luggage. People running into each other in a tiny pedestrian lane occupied by persons entering and exiting the baggage area. No accurate signage for direction, just a few employees in yellow vests waving their arms. Next is the reloading of baggage prior to entering Immigration then TSA. Because of a recent knee replacement, I was relegated to the scanner line. Little movement of the line due to a break down of the ONE machine. We were directed to the metal detector whereby the agent just waved us through (the machine beeped, but was flag through anyway). Next was our quest to find Terminal E (gate 30). Signage was confusing. Nobody to direct. Found a flight attendant who directed us to a Skytrain, it could not adequately explain where to go next. A stroke of luck took us to the gate. We were in the last boarding group which was being called as we approached the gate. We have traveled to some second tiered countries that are better equipped to handle passengers in an organized manner. This is no way to run an airport. One that I will avoid at all costs.",-1,MIA

First of all, the cleaning of the areas once the passenger disembark from the airplane there were even water leaks from the roof with plastic containers to collect the falling water. The conveyors to help passengers walk to the passport control area did not work. Once the passenger gets into the immigration area, there were just a few positions active so the lines were incredibly long; we, my wife and I, wasted a least one hour after a long journey of ten. And we were on the US Citizens line; I cannot imagine the waiting time for foreign visitors. This is not the quality level that we can expect from the most avance country over the world! This is not the image we should be exposing to our visitors. Besides, we, the Citizens, deserve a better treatment!",-1,MIA

When we arrived at the Miami airport, we were required to go through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection process since we were reentering the U.S. The line was very long and there was no sense of urgency by the staff to help customers. Despite having many booths to help folks, there was just four employees manning them, and all but one employee worked at a very slow pace. After spending an hour in the Customs line we then proceeded to get our luggage. No staff member explained that we needed to pick up our luggage and take it to another location. Once we figured out what needed to be done we then proceeded to security. Once we arrived there, the line was crazy long and it took over an hour to get through that line. The staff there also worked at a very slow pace. We spent over two and a half hours getting through security and customs which caused us to miss our connecting flight. There were many people in line with us who also complained about poor customer service, slow service, and lack of coordination by the staff. In fact, a lot of other people missed their connecting flights as a result of this disaster. I hope I never had to visit the Miami airport again.",-1,MIA

The transit gateway from entering and passing through customs is the worst. Not only are TSA agents rude and unprofessional, the layout of the airport is terrible. I have had stuff stolen here from me when I put it down, as well as having to run from one side of the airport to the other sprinting to catch the next flight. The airport is super rundown and I don’t know how American Airlines is using this as their hub to South America. I have global entry and the transit from checkin a bag in to go through domestic is a joke. Then the line to the transit from Internstional to domestic takes 30 minutes. It’s better to just exit and re-enter through. This could have saved me 30 minutes. The food selection is terrible and there isn’t much else appealing but I’m going to South America for work and leisure so this is the worst part of my journey.",-1,MIA
2022-11-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,worst airport in the country,False,"  Miami airport is hands-down the very worst airport in the country. It’s unconscionable that they make you walk over 3/4 of a mile ( Measured it on an exercise app) to get from your arrival gate to passport control. Long long Corredor‘s 75% without any people mover walkways, and of the few people Movers at least half were broken and non-functioning. Then after passport control it’s almost another 3/4 of a mile to get your baggage recheck it and get to your connection gate. Senior citizens and kids, everybody has to walk this far. It was exactly the same thing last time I came through Miami last August. Hands-down the very worst airport in the country! Whoever managers this airport should be fired immediately for incompetence!",-1,MIA

Dropped off the Hire Car at the spookily quiet car rental centre (car sat nav and then good signage made it easy from the I95), and got the shuttle train to the relatively quiet Terminal. Easy to find the BA check in desks, queues not too bad and after 15 minutes we went through Security. Found the American Airlines Flagship Lounge (near Gate D 30) and checked in with a glass of champagne. Sat doiwn to find that my wife had left her cell phone at security in one of the plastic trays. A half hour search back at the security gate, and with the help of security staff and a fellow passenger and thankfully she found it. A big Thank you to those staff and the passenger - one relieved wife. Don't know whether this is a trend but we have found Miami International has improved over the years - far, far better than it was, say, 15 years ago. Would, on this basis, recommend.",1,MIA
2022-10-10,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,A very disorganized airport,True," A very disorganized airport. Wait until you read this! We arrived from Madrid into their international terminal. We had a connecting flight to our final destination. Our bags were checked from Madrid through to our final destination. Customs worked smoothly with Global Entry. Then we needed to pick up our luggage before we could drop baggage off for our final destination. It took 50 minutes for our bags to come. We then had to take our bags into the Main Terminal to the American Check in location. Needless to say, we along with many other people missed their connecting flight. Just saying, most international airports have a system in place where you put your bags on the conveyer belt after going through customs. I have never had to go get in line again in the main terminal. Please avoid Miami, I would say its a step below Atlanta.",-1,MIA

For hours we ran around the airport begging for help and were turned around in different directions by many employees that didn’t want to take the time to deal with it. We are so grateful for Miss Rodriguez’s kindness so that we didn’t miss our connecting flight! Also, another kind woman at lost and found on the 4th floor, whose name I did not catch, was very helpful and giving of her time. There was also a very nice tall man who worked near terminal D25 that was so incredibly kind and offered to walk the airport until we met Rodriguez. I could not have asked for 3 nicer people to meet today. Thank you all for being understanding human beings and helping turn our chaotic day around to make it a little better.",1,MIA

They have many information desks...but no-one is there at night or weekends. The elevators and moving walkways are broken. Some employees don't even speak English. What kind of message is Miami trying to send? Management is only interested in money...how much money they can make. They are not spending it on the people who make that airport a money maker. And when you complain, all you get is how much they try...but management does not support the front line employees. We have traveled to 5 different airports this year and every one of them show support to us when we have a question or problem.

My husband and I are traveling with an infant. I tried to check in on the Spirit app and they only provided me with my husband’s boarding pass. It said I had to go to special assist at the airport to get mine and the baby’s boarding pass. We arrived an hour and 45 mins before our flight. We were dropped off at the departure gate for Spirit but the check in was all the way on the other side of the airport on a lower level. We checked our stroller and car seat with our bag. We then had to walk back to the gate where the TSA line said 15 mins. The line of people did not reflect the estimated time. We tried to go through the tsa pre check line but the representative would only speak to me in Spanish and we were ignored by many. We also told many airport staff that we aren’t going to make it on our flight. No one cared. The tsa line took 45 mins to get through. My husband ran to the gate because it was no where near the line and the gate was closed even though it was still 5 mins before departure. After running with an infant in my arms we missed our flight by 6 mins. We could not make it back to check in to request my child’s items because of how far away check in is from the gate. Now I’m stranded in the Miami airport and have no way to transport my infant.,-1,MIA

Today it was unbelievably horrible. Right away, 2 out of 4 people movers were inoperative. Given the actual 1/2 mile to walk, this was not appropriate. Initial customs was not bad but then everyone was screened again! Usually they spot check but today, there was one PO’d girl checking passports and only one screening lane open. A guy was walking back and forth saying to put tablets and computers separate and shoes and belts off. The crowd was getting impatient when some young group cut the line. A supervisor was called out and they were sent back after some yelling and shouting. Finally another lane opened right as we were up front. Then as we were taking shoes and belts off the agent said “why are you pulling your computers out?” I had the regrettable audacity to inform him the the other agent was shouting those instructions to the crowd. That annoyed him so we stuffed the laptop and tablet back into their case and moved on to baggage claim and re-check.so why don’t they screen all bags again if all people are being scanned again after being in a contained environment? This was bizarre and chaotic at the very least and unprofessional at worst. Unless my life depends on it I will avoid MIA for the 2 years I have left before moving to Colombia.",-1,MIA

Arrived 3.5 hours prior to our flight to drop off the hire car. The Car Rental Centre is a decent set up but a relatively long way from the airport. Lots of walking, escalators and a train to get to the check in area. Long lines at British Airways check in with only two agents working behind the six available desks. Bag drop took nearly two hours. TSA security wasn't as bad but still took 30 minutes.

This time, more of the same with the lines for customs being ridiculously long, but that's normal for them. I also wanted some transport info as I has a long stopover, and walked to 3 different information counters. Not one of them was manned by any staff member! All were automated with a button to call. I called repeatedly but it rang and rang with no answer. Ok, I finally figured it out on my own after a bunch of time wasted, and took the airport tram to the public transport area.

The lady who came from security looked right at me & said nothing (like, “I’ll get to you in a minute”), & took the scooter, & closed the door! I was furious! Wished I could yell. They treated me so badly at security that by the time I left, I cried. To top it off, the airport was so cold I could barely move my fingers to sign or type to my husband about it!

Involves Skytrain and elevators and a lot of walking. The airport website not helpful in planning how to get there. Some waiting areas filthy and this is early morning. Food and grime on seats.

This is the worst airport I've ever been in. Staff were less than helpful, TSA was disorganized and simply ignoring people trying to go through the screening, and ""valet"" baggage check people were genuinely rude. Shout out to the guy at currency exchange for being helpful and friendly! He was a lone beacon of professionalism and general politeness. If I have to drive an extra 30 miles or so to go out of Ft.

It taught me a valuable lesson. Never, ever, use this airport for your international connections. They won't certify this review but all you have to do is look at all the previous reviews for the exact same issues weeks and months ago. Woefully understaffed, contract security couldn't even answer questions like. Which line is which and these appeared to be supervisory personnel. They were so bad they couldn't keep the lines organized and there were no signs no directions. The TSA were just as bad. We travel internationally a couple of times a year and have never had to go back through screening after clearing customs and immigration. Maybe rules have changed, but the TSA was overwhelmed. It was kind of sad actually. Dozens and dozens of passengers from any airline coming through on 2/20 in the evening, missed their connections due to poorly trained and poorly supervised personnel. If you don't have at least a four hour cushion to make your connection you won't make it. Just imagine what it will be like when the airports get really busy. Use Charlotte instead.",-1,MIA
2022-02-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Miami Airport was understaffed,True,"  American Airlines continues to disappoint, as does the Miami airport. Flight from Barbados arrived 100% on time, and was even acknowledged by the gate clerk who rebooked me on standby the next morning. Connection left a number of us stranded when Miami Airport was understaffed and got our luggage to us late for transfer, and couldn’t get us through the line in time. I’m sleeping in the airport tonight as AA is taking no responsibility for not holding the plane and leaving us all behind. I’ve been flying for 5 decades and this may be the most disgraceful and incompetent handling of a trip I’ve ever seen.",-1,MIA
2022-02-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Worst airport I have experienced,True,"  Worst airport I have experienced in the United States and I fly about once per month. American Airlines terminal security checkpoint took 1.5 hours to get through. I have not seen lines like this since shortly after 9/11. To make matters worse, TSA and MIA employees were doing nothing to assist in keeping the lines organized or moving forward. This entire process was a free for all. Once in the gate area, there is almost no where to charge electronic devices in the gate areas besides one desk with two electrical outlets. The American Airlines customer service was terrible and had multiple gate changes. The gates in this airport can also be extremely far apart and one gate change took almost 15 minutes to walk to without an easier and accessible way to speed this up such as a walking escalator. I ordered food at Wendy’s thinking this would be the quickest possible food and gave up waiting for my food after I had been waiting for 30 minutes. Overall, I can confidently say my experience at Miami International was the worse travel experience I have had in the last two decades. I will make a conscious effort to avoid flying into or connecting through MIA if at all possible.",-1,MIA

Only 1 TSA agent checking ID and 1 belt running. Because of this we missed our flight. Had to stand in line another 1.5 hours in a “rebooking line.” What should have been a direct 3.5 hour flight turned into an all day marathon at 3 different airports.

I am totally mortified at the service of this ""Great Nation"", it's attitude towards its visitors is shocking. We were only there for a connecting flight which the rude and extremely unhelpful staff made us miss. Disorganised, over priced, dirty. Apart from the guy that helped us after we missed our connecting flight which there was absolutely no time for due to the queues at passport control and then back in through security check. There were no signs showing where to go for connecting flights. We found the connection flight queue eventually after being stuffed in a huge snake like queue, packed in like sardines. At one point, a guy started letting all the US Nationals through to get their queue down and they took preference over the connecting flights. We only had 35 mins to board by this point. Needless to say flight missed. One horrid woman was so nasty to me when we missed our flight (which I sprinted through the airport to get to) I was stunned.

Going through customs is always a mess, with long wait times for bags, disorganized rechecking of baggage, and then subsequent security checks that make you almost miss your connecting flights. The lines are always long, the TSA agents are so disrespectful, rude, and separate families who should be together all with TSA pre check. It is always a crapshoot knowing what rules and regulations they are going to enforce and then be rude to you about when you either do the maximum expected protocols, or don’t because the list literally says you don’t have to (take your shoes off, take your belt off or wallet out with an expedited screening.)

The security line on a Sunday morning was over an hour and a half long, and literally snaked through the terminal. As of the time of this review, the following airlines use the G gates: Bahamasair, Southwest, Sun Country, and United Airlines. There is only one TSA checkpoint that serves this concourse, zero signs for TSA PreCheck, and clueless employees attempting to organize the chaos. Additionally, the contracted employees that work at the airport (working for a third-party employer rather than actual airline employees) are absolutely miserable, and treat customers like they're an inconvenience. I think the larger D gates at the airport offer a better experience as there are four TSA entry points. The G gates, with minimal seating, an air conditioner that barely works, and next to nothing for food options, are a nightmare.",-1,MIA

Absolute shambles of an immigration service at Miami airport. When I first arrived, I thought long queue, yes, but 40 terminals, this shouldn't be too bad. I noticed were were moving fairly slowly and then, as I first glimpsed it, the horror hit. For us 'non-citizens' only 27 terminals were available, doesn't sound too bad still however there were only 2 (two - I have to put it in brackets as it is barely believable), officers on duty for us So for the 3 flights of majority 'non-citizens' that had recently arrived (my approximation at least 400) we were being served by 2 officers. Well as you can imagine, considering they like to ask an awful lot of questions and take photos and fingerprints and all of that, it took an awful long time (4hrs by my count). Didn't even get a stamp in my passport (because of COVID) alright for people to stand in close proximity to each other for 4hrs though!

Waited at customs for 45 minutes, they were severely understaffed and were closing lines despite the growing crowds that were about to miss their flights. We then had to get our luggage from baggage claim at the other end? We then had to go check our bags in again? (Why couldn’t they just transport our bags like a typical airport?) Next, we waited at TSA for so so long. We were told to move to different lines 3 times, each at different locations. The TSA staff was insanely rude, despite letting them know (nicely) we were about to miss our connecting flight. We then had to run across the entire airport to almost miss our flight.

We had been through two different airports on two different continents, for me to arrive for a transfer in my home country. Only in the US was I treated horribly. It started with the Global Entry ""staff"". The man at the desk that verifies the receipt from the kiosk was rude to everyone we saw him interact with, including a man traveling with his young daughter. He yelled at this man for not clearing his child through Global Entry. Next we got to experience collecting our bags for the international transfer. There was no person working in the baggage claim area to answer any questions, such as if we had to do the transfer ourselves. Next we had to check in to Copa Airlines. Rudest airline I have ever dealt with in my travels. Then 34 USD for a beer and small Moscow Mule. Overall the experience in Miami was the low point of our trip.

Never have I ever experienced any 1 security line with more than 4 checkpoints at each terminal. On top of this with covid travel numbers. Security doesn't care if you miss flight and they actively laugh at you while living through high stress and anxiety. They have all the tools to make it run smoothly, they have unprofessional and sloth moving people. Covid has created an apathy to get people to work. How are we supposed to get back to work if no one actually wants to do their job. Not once was a supervisor present to get things moving. I also checked the security wait times online in the MIA airport and they were completely inaccurate.

After waiting in lines for about 40 minutes to get through customs, you have to literally exit the airport. There is no signage for connection flights, you just have to go the baggage claim. From baggage claim you have to collect your checked baggage. Again no signage. You then have to go completely back through security. Anything you bought at your last airport, duty free, any liquids will be thrown out. Again zero signage giving you a heads up that you might want to check anything you've bought while stuck at your last airports. So heads up, this airport is terrible.

We queued with hundreds of other people for 2 hours to get through the Visa check. It seemed as if everybody went for their break at the same time! Good planning (not). The line just did not move. We were shouted into a queue to take our photo and fingerprints on a machine and then shouted at again to get into yet another queue with hundreds of people waiting to see a Customs Officer. We were told to present a copy of the photo we already had taken at the machine. He did exactly the same thing as we had already done and took yet another photo but, this time taking fingerprints of both hands. What an absolute joke this airport is. The rudeness of one of the officials astounded us. He must have been an ex serviceman or police officer in a former life. He was aggressive and treated everybody as if they were 10 years old. He shouted at anybody that did not get in the correct line. It is really not acceptable to have these sort of people working in this environment. This has put us off visiting Miami/Florida again.

2020-02-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,Not professional at all,False,"  Arrived from Barcelona and cleared customs with sufficient time to get aboard an earlier departure flight to my next destination. The Departures sign board indicated the gate as D 9 (if memory serves), so we quickly followed the signs towards corridor D. But guess what, even though one hallway was clearly marked with a D (and an arrow) it had a barrier across the entrance and a big floor sign: No Admittance. So back we went to the main corridor, where we saw directional arrows for Gates D-E etc, so down that corridor we race, looking for an American Rebooking desk. None in sight, anywhere, despite this being a major American hub. Stopped at one gate that was staffed and asked where the rebooking desk was, and was told it was something like D-37 or D-3, and then the agent volunteered that one might be a little closer, so off in that direction we ran. When we finally got there, we were told that the doors had already been closed (never mind that it would have been about a 15 minute walk to get there anyway). So we resigned ourselves to an interminable wait down near D-1, where a bottled beer was ""only"" $10.50, not counting tax and a ""suggested tip of $1.50."" When it finally was near time for the departure for the later flight, suddenly there was a flurry of activity at the adjacent gates, when apparently four American flights were to depart within 15 minutes of one another from gates D-1 to D-5. And since there seemed to be only one PA, the assembled passengers became understandably restless when the gate attendant announced ""we are now boarding Groups 1 and 2"" without bothering to state the destination or flight number. Confusing? You bet. Especially when said announcement was drowned out by another PA telling ""passenger XXX, please report to the gate."" Final boarding began when five wheelchairs were rolled to the plane, followed very quickly by anyone who simply showed his/her boarding pass and walked aboard. There was only one American gate agent on duty, apparently all the others were still dealing with the adjacent flights. Not professional at all.",-1,MIA

I used mobile pass and went through and asked the person which queue to get into, and she said 35 or 36. I went to 36, and the officer at the desk said I was in the wrong line. I asked him which line was the correct one and pointed at the woman behind us (she was maybe 10 feet behind me) and said ""she told me to go to this line"" and he just waived randomly to the other 35 lines and said ""back there"". He did not even bother looking up from his cell phone. So, I went back to the woman who had told me originally that it was line 35 or 36, and she said, ""oh, I meant 34 or 35."" (We were standing right in front of lines 34, 35, and 36.) She seriously could not have been less concerned that she's giving out misinformation. The officer in line 36 also could not be bothered to simply say the queue right next to him was the correct one. Seriously. They are useless, and do not even attempt to improve. They should all be fired for their attitudes and giving out incorrect information.

Our tickets told us to go to terminal H. Once we passed security and went to our gate we were told it had changed to G. The security at G wouldn't let us pass because the tickets said terminal H. It took us forever to persuade them that the flight terminal and gate were changed. At this point my mother-in-law couldn't walk anymore because we were standing in line forever and she is elderly and has diabetes. When we asked for help several employees sneered and were sarcastic asking if they should roll out the red carpet for us. It was just the two of us and 4 kids. My daughter had dropped hot water on her chest just an hour before and was treated by first responders (who were absolutely amazing) at the Military Lounge, so I couldn't help her, my mother-in-law, and the other 3 kids all at the same time. Because my MIL could barely walk we were talking to each other that chances are we'd miss our flight, at which point one of the TSA agents started yelling how she didn't care and sat for over 10 mins without letting me have my shoes or my daughter's ice pouch the first responders gave us. They absolutely refused to let us keep the aloe we were given by the medics because I refused to show them my daughter's burned chest! She is 7! She was already distressed because of the second degree burns. She had huge blisters on her belly and chest that were treated by the medics and bandaged. Where is your humanity? Is your life so miserable you need to take it out on a little girl who sat in pain for 4 hours because you couldn't let her have her medicine? How dare you ask to see my daughter's bare chest to confirm she has burns? It's called HIPAA for a reason. You are not a medical professional. Is your day better because you managed to put down a military spouse, her four children and her mother-in-law? I cannot believe these are the people my husband serves and protects.",-1,MIA

All staff are so rude but also in their defence look very stressed. The airport security is just plain weird, you go down this weird slope, all the staff are chatting to each other grunting at customers and I would say not throughly checking each individual! I went to walk through the security scanner and it was clearly half working it out when I walked through the lady asked me to pause, I waited 2 minutes expecting to be asked to go back through - nope! She looked at me up and down shrugged her shoulders and let me through now that is just crazy! The carpets smell too, the decor is stuck in the 70-80’s whenever the airport was built and they have done nothing to jazz anything up a bit. The departure area consists of a small bar and a Pizza Hut, always a huge queue in each because there is nowhere else to go.

I had 2 hours to make a connection from Mexico City to Hartford. American Airlines should have known better than to book such a short layover through this wretched place. The plane was delayed 15 minutes on the tarmac and then 10 more at the gate when no agent was available to operate the entryway. Then, there was an interminable walk through unmarked hallways to an interminable immigration line. There, after being herded to the automated kiosks, I was herded to wait over 40 minutes for an agent who was gleefully asking smug questions of every U.S. citizens in line, spending an average of 5 minutes with each person. Other lines moved more quickly at this point, so this is clearly a particular agent’s power trip. At this point, when I tried to find where to re-check my luggage, an agent rudely asked me for when my connnection was. This was the first time I was asked about my connection time, notwithstanding the “short layover” stickers that had been plastered all over my suitcase. At this point, the rude American Airlines employee told me to go to a different line from the one which I was standing, with now explanation. I assumed, incorrectly, that this was an expedited line, since I still had around 40 minutes to catch my flight. It was not. The door that the rude agent sent me through took me outside of security to the airline agents for rebooking. I learned from another agent that I had been sent there because other agents decided that the remaining 40 minutes was not sufficient for me to make my connection. And, throughout the process, the half-dozen or so staff members that I had the misfortune of interacting with were extraordinarily rude and impassive to the fact that they were part of an inefficient and abusive machine that was making thousands of passengers miserable. Unfortunately, I need to make this same trip for work several times a year. In the future, it will cost me around a hundred dollars to book itineraries on a different airline (probably Delta) in order to avoid this airport. It will be worth every penny.",-1,MIA

Some are acceptable, others are good, and a few are excellent. MIA is in a category by itself. Apart from the worst parking facilities I have ever encountered and an urgent need to improve its shoddy appearance, the immigration service seems to consist mostly of incompetent agents. After sitting in the Interjet airliner for a full hour after boarding and a flight of about two and a half hours, it took my wife and little granddaughter another three hours to pass through immigration and customs. Such gross inefficiency and total lack of caring for passenger needs is reprehensible. Those responsible for running such an operation should be relieved of their jobs and replaced by competent personnel. Clearly, the travelling public deserves something better than this. Our family will surely not be the only one to avoid using this airport for our future travel needs.",-1,MIA

This was to service a full load of passengers from a Boeing 777. It wasn't until I had spent two and a half hours waiting in the queue that they finally opened some additional desks. It took 3 hours just to have my passport checked! It took 30 minutes at Montego Bay in Jamaica. I spoke to a couple, who missed their connecting flight by 5 minutes, due to the unacceptable time waiting in this queue and as a result, lost 1 day of their holiday, Fort Worth Texas, was quicker but still took over an hour. When I asked if there was anyway of speeding up the process, as it was quite likely that I would miss my connecting flight back to the UK, the airport staff just stated that there was nothing to be done in order to speed the process up.

The immigration queues were endless, and most of the desks were closed. We had to jump through the queues for immigration officers (thank you to those who allowed us to do so) having already waited an hour to use the machines. There were virtually no staff around, and those that were there couldn’t care less if you miss your flight. No allowances made for those who have connecting flights.

2019-04-20,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,poor management,True," Zero stars if I could rate that low. We sat in the runway for 35-45 minutes after arrival from Barbados - the reasoning because of “other aircraft that needed to taxi”. Go ahead and start the stop watch. We needed to make a connecting flight to Richmond, and we only had an hour to get to our other aircraft. Well 35 minutes wasted sitting in the runway. Thank you either aircraft controllers or American Airlines. Once we were off the plane (another 10 minutes after waiting on the runway ) we made our way through one customs line where literally 500 hundred people were waiting. We waited in customs for another hour - at this point our plane had already started boarding for Richmond. After making it through the customs checks, there were 6 other customs officers sitting around talking and laughing (twiddling their thumbs) Maybe they could have helped open up more lanes in customs? No - poor management. To add on top of all of this, the one line was full of Miami residents that did not need to make a connecting flight. Maybe they could have opened up a different line for solely connecting flights? No - poor management. After customs we then had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and recheck our luggage! I get this was American Airlines however this was another wasted 30 minutes. After all of this was said and done all but one American line was open so our so called “pre-check passes were useless “After talking with a behind the counter representative from American, they would not reimburse us for a hotel or could they guarantee a seat in the next flight to Richmond. After staying the night in Miami on our expense, we arrived to our gate and American Airlines informed us only seat was available and that my wife could go ahead while I had to wait for another flight 10 hours later. But guess what? This was not a guaranteed seat either. Looks like I’ll be staying in Miami until the I purchase my own set of tickets again. All in all, this was a nightmare that the airport or American Airlines did not want to admit to their poorly planned schematics of arrivals and connecting flights. Hands down the worst flying experience I have ever encountered. - thank you TSA, Customs and American Airlines for ruining my trip. You can check me off your list of being a returning customer. I hope 1000s will read this so they can be forewarned of possible miseries. Something that could have been completely avoided if Miami knew how to run an airport.",-1,MIA

My teenage children felt harassed and chastised during the security process even though they followed orders. The instructions weren’t written or clear and the process was long winded and stressful. We heard the security lady complaining about people being impatient but felt this was totally inappropriate in the circumstances. We are currently sat in the admirals lounge in the flagship area for Oneworld passengers and the service and food are disappointing.

2019-02-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,worst airport in the modern world,True," The worst airport I’ve ever had to navigate. We had a 3 hours layover where we were coming in from London. 1. Air traffic control had us circle for 20 minutes. Ok, that happens. 2. Once we landed we were stuck on the tarmac for 40 minutes due to another plane not having docked correctly? and lack of communication regarding which gates the preceding planes were to be at. This doesn’t really happen much, so it was frustrating. 3. We had to go through two different rounds of security screening before having to pick up our checked bags. At the first one, even though we’re had the mobile passport completed, there was no line for mobile passport and with 6 kiosks only 2 were open; one exclusively for crew and global entry with the other for everyone else. 4. We had to then collect our luggage, which took another 30 minutes, to be randomly selected to have them rummage through our things. 5. Once they unfolded everything and left it a mess we were dismissed and sent towards the exit. We then had to recheck our bags at the airline desk which was on a different level and a long way away. Luckily, an airline staff member allowed us to skip the line and simply drop the bags. This was the one person who was helpful; airline staff. 6. Next we had to go through airport security again, however, this time it was the same security you go through if you were just arriving to the airport. Keep in mind we had just gotten off of an airplane here at the airport. Once in the line we got to hurry up and wait while 6 TSA employees condescendingly yelled at everyone. Nothing helpful from them, just threats to slow the line if their power-trip-orders weren’t obeyed. If someone failed to zip up their backpack before sending it through the scanner, instead of asking them to zip it, the person was chastised in front of the crowd. 7. The line of travelers constantly growing while the Walmart approach (having many registers with only one open) was adopted by the TSA staff. One screening conveyor belt was in use while 3 others were closed. With the exception of the lady who was running the conveyor belt, who would not make eye contact with anyone even when asked why my sealed clear bag from the duty free store back in a London was set aside. Nope, my duty free items needed to be taken out and run through another scanner. 8. What was the rest of the TSA staff doing? Literally walking around in circles not know who was supposed to do what. I heard “hey, who is on this one?” And “I though so and so was supposed to be here still” along with other statements that really reassured me our safety was the priority and was being handled by professionals. 9. We were reassured that once through this last “security” check that the gate was literally just up another escalator. Nope. Next we had to jump on yet another shuttle. 10. What’s the best part of this whole experience. The arrival gate (e24) was in the same terminal as the departure gate (e31). All of that fuss was to go through customs. In short, this is the worst airport in the modern world to deal with and I will gladly pay more to fly through another airport in the future so that I can avoid this from happening again.",-1,MIA
2019-02-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,2.0,1.0,An awful experience,True," Oh dear no. An awful experience. When you stand in a queue for an hour and 15 minutes with no access to a toilet and nowhere to sit it leaves a bad taste. I have to remind myself as meander like I’m in a queue at Disney that we are meant to be in the most advanced 1st world country on earth. I mean the citizens of this country landed men on the moon 50 years ago and sent satellites to the furthest edges of our solar system yet they can’t efficiently push people through airport arrivals. So after an hour and 15 minutes in a queue we were put into an area of robotic machines by semi robotic staff. One must put the four fingers of one hand on a glass plate on the machine, feed their passport into a slot and look at a light for the machine to take your photograph as if you are facing prison. The machine then spits out a paper ticket with your photo and passport details. In our case although the ticket told us to proceed out one of the semi robotic staff put us to another darn queue. This one took another 45 minutes and when we got to the counter we got to do it all over again. That’s to say, fingerprinted, photographed and passport examined. So what moron thinks it’s a good idea to push hundreds of people to machines only to then put them to human beings to do the exact same thing all over again? Insane duplication and a complete waste of time. I think the Germans call this verschlimmbesserung. So two hours with no access to water, toilet or a seat and to make matters much much worse was that whenever airline crew arrived they got preference over us to go through immigration with no consideration for the fact we’d been standing for hours. When I arrived at the airport I had a lot of sympathy for the folks working here because with the 21st century reincarnation of PT Barnum in the White House they weren’t getting paid but by the time I was standing an hour I felt I wouldn’t pay them either. Barnum may be on capitol hill but arrivals at Miami airport was a horrible circus all of its own.",-1,MIA

We have had to connect through MIA several times in the last year to other destinations. As we are frequent travelers, not much gets to us as we have been through a lot until it came to going through MIA several times. This is by far the worst, unfriendly, unhelpful and delayed airport we have ever experienced. Our decision after the last layover is that we will never ever go through MIA again.

",False,"  The airport is not very customer friendly. I was to go to Terminal E for both trips through Miami and I must say the E is clearly the reject terminal. It’s disconnected from the main terminal and plenty hard to get to. Even with the train, it’s still an awkward and seemingly unnecessary drag of a walk. I’d consider myself an able-bodied, active and healthy young woman but I can only imagine being a passenger who needs more time and assistance to make it from point A to B. Terminal E (the reject) has the worst food and store accommodations I have ever seen. There is very little variety and no real restaurants. It’s pretty pathetic. If I hadn’t spent all that trouble trying to get to E, I would have doubled back to eat in D.",-1,MIA

Our time in the airport was minimal as we were able to quickly locate the transfer service to the port and we were on our way in a short time. On Saturday, December 8 we returned to the Miami airport to await our return flight to Toronto. We arrived at the airport about 9.30 am and our flight was not until 2.00 pm so we had 4.5 hours to spend at the airport and we were not impressed with the experience. Upon getting off the transfer bus, we were directed to an outdoor counter to check our bags. This counter had minimal protection from the weather and we would have been quite uncomfortable if it had been raining or if we had been there mid-day in the hot sun. As others have mentioned, the cost of simple drink and snack options is extremely expensive. Several outlets did not even post prices but just a menu with a list of options. We settled on a coke, coffee and sandwich from the Starbucks outlet situated near gate D32. This location was convenient, well staffed and very clean. The major disappointment concerned the overall unkept state of the airport. There was a lot of garbage blowing around the waiting area where we checked our bags. The washrooms were filthy and the paper towel dispensers were empty. There were plenty of garbage cans but they were overflowing with trash.",-1,MIA

The agent was very quick, took my photo, surprised there was no finger printing and no stamp on my passport and didn’t want my customs form. As I left the terminal no one wanted to collect my customs form, seems the process has changed. Anyway I was from plane door to kerb in 20 minutes. I was only in Miami overnight before connecting to Sint Maarten. Used AA priority check in and there was a short queue. Took the agent a while to check me in (I was wondering if there were problems with my paperwork and was suspecting the immigration agent screwed up the previous evening). Eventually she checked me in she all documents were fine. I used the business class security line at the D gates and was through security in 15 minutes. I wanted to use the AA Flagship lounge at gate D30 (Lounge was excellent). I needed plenty of time to walk to my flight at gate D3. But it was a pleasant 10 minute hike. Gate area was a mess.

We arrived from Costa Rica a family of four, which we had booked our reservations as a family. We were told to stay together through the screening, through customs all the way, which we did. However, the chaos began as soon as we arrived at the Miami airport. My ticket was pre-check as we thought all four would be since they were all booked under my name as the lead person. We were instructed to go to the two different check-points. After being turned around twice, I informed the young lady that we had gone through this twice. If we had to come back, a manager is going to have to get involved. She instructed us to go back to checkpoint three because” the staff member there was new and didn’t know what she was telling us.” We went back, and sure enough, the staff member began to tell us to separate again. I told her what the previous employer had said to us, she pulled up our ticket on her phone and told us to go ahead. I couldn’t believe the level disconnect of communication here in the United States; there is a lot to be learned from Liberia Airport. Courtesy and politeness from the employees for starters. We finally arrived at our gate for departure. As we sat there trying to listen for the changes of gates. The intercom system is not the best; one could barely hear the changes. We saw so many travelers missing their flight and upset, as they should have been. The announcement should have been clear, and anyone on that flight name should have been called before that plane departed. I felt bad for those that were unable to hear the message in the mist of all the chaos. I’m sure that with all the upgrades in technology the intercom system can be much better, employee interaction should be superior. Staff should act as if they want to assist you and not as if they owe you something, remember we are “paying” travelers whether by awards or by credit cards we have paid for service and should be treated with politeness, respect, and clear communication.",-1,MIA

",False,"  Twice disappointed with the service at the transportation center. I understand that the staff may want to be friendly but they appear to be selectively friendly. I was trying to make a train; the person at the kiosk was having a leisurely chat and had no time to help me with my questions. He misinformed me, pointing me to the ticket machine and stating that I first had to purchase a ticked on the level where he was. Even after I had the ticket he still was talking and giving his opinions on some subject and did not stop talking to assist. The area was not crowded, but I had to figure things out myself. When I got down to the tracks there were ticket machines I could have bought a ticket. But by the time I had traipsed my luggage down the stairs (no mention or direction regarding an elevator) the train had departed. It being a Sunday afternoon I had to wait another hour. A week earlier, I had to wait for more than 5 minutes while the kiosk person spoke to another traveler about where he grew up and the schools he went to. Like I say, friendly—I get it—but isn’t the job one of helping travelers get from one place to another?",1,MIA

That's quite expensive and foreigners may not have American money to pay besides being alot of money for a cart. International arriving passengers may have alot of luggage they need to claim and transfer after a long flight. I have not seen having to pay for a luggage cart in most International destinations. It's a sad comment to welcome them to the land of the free and the home of the brave.,-1,MIA

2018-07-31,0.7,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,All staff were polite,True," Flew into MIA on September 26 from Madrid and out on October 2, going back, both legs on Iberia. Despite of what is being said compared to other airports, Miami worked quite all right for us. On arrival there were some works and had to walk longer than necessary, but went through immigration and an acceptable speed. All staff were polite. At arrivals got the chance to buy a US sim card. Waiting for hotel shuttle was tiring after a long flight, as there was not enough seating there. Also, TSA at MIA is much faster than at Orlando airport. Most importantly, arriving from Orlando on American Airlines and having to pick up luggage, as we didn't have a through ticket, and having to check in for Iberia was not bad! We just had to walk straight on from the AA part of the airport to that of Iberia. No need for elevators, or shuttles! Spanish-speaking staff are polite and courteous and do make an effort to help out. Overall, we have a positive impression of Miami!",1,MIA

2018-07-14,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,it was a shambles,False,"  Probably the worst airport experience I've ever had. I was only there for a connection as I was travelling from MBJ- MIA then back to the UK. Customs in the UK is so simple and quite quick considering. The staff were so rude at customs in particular at security, they ignored you pretending they were speaking on the radio and couldn't hear. When we had to get our ESTA tickets it was a shambles as we had to do everything in 1.5 hours in time for the connecting flight. Instead of managing the queues one particular staff member kept shouting at me because I was using a different kiosk from my dad, which makes no sense because those questions were long so if there is a kiosk next to him it makes sense to use that - as I did on my way here 5 days ago. Other people were using more than one kiosk but she spent her time focusing on me instead of organising the queue. She kept shouting saying 'Mam Mam Mam' you can't use the kiosk, despite telling her 2 times our connecting flight was soon. The guy at customs was so rude, I'm sure that if you are travelling with a family member you're supposed to go up with them? But, we got yelled at and only my dad was allowed to go, I eventually went up and then a few seconds the customs guy called up another man who was after me - assuming he was my dad, I had to tell him we were not travelling together. In addition, we had to rush through security bear in mind by this point we only had 25 minutes left until we boarded the plane. My dad tried to ask one of the security women a question and she just pretended that she was listening to her radio and that it was so important, she didn't even acknowledge my dad. We kept telling them we were boarding in 25 minutes and no-one cared. Also when they give out blue cards when you go through security - the ones that determine whether you take your shoes off or not/take out your laptop. I just wanted to double check if I needed one as my dad got one and a few people before him did and she just shouted to 'go in that line'. Surprisingly we made the flight, and it was delayed by 45 minutes due to the manifest being typed up incorrectly.",-1,MIA
2018-07-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,signs were not straightforward,False,"  I've never been to a more confusing airport in my life. The signs were not straightforward. On our boarding pass, it said Terminal CE, but none of its signs stated that, it will state Concourse and a list of letters that did not make any sense to us, which was not helpful at all. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours because the captain was unable to arrive at the Miami airport due to the weather in Tampa, which is completely reasonable. However, the situation could've been handled much better. The people that worked outside the gate were unhelpful. They pretty much expected everyone to have smart phones and therefore were negligent in giving us, customers, regular updates as to when our flight will arrive. They only updated people who stood waiting in line for 15 minutes, instead of just efficiently announcing it to the general public, not that their updates were helpful to the individuals that stood in line because they kept pushing it to every hour, so it was very hard for customers to plan accordingly. By giving us an incorrect ETA, we were not able to decide whether to rebook to another flight or not. If we had known that the flight was going to be delayed for 5 hours, we would've gotten on a different flight. But the people at the gate kept ensuring us that it would only be an hour delayed, and then another hour if we asked again and again. This misinformation is unacceptable. In addition, the airport was freezing. I had to wait in line for 30 minutes at the Service Center for blankets to be told there were no clean blankets. I would check in with them a few more times and was told there were still no clean blankets available, during this 5 hours waiting period, this huge international airport did not think to provide blankets. So not only was my flight delayed, I caught a fever due to waiting at the cold airport for 5 hours, and had to call out of work the next day.",-1,MIA

Signage was confusing for getting to baggage, collecting it, navigating customs, rechecking bag and then security finally!

Security check in terminal D was where I needed to be at. Without explanation, I was asked to go to Checkpoint E. Get to checkpoint E, asked to go to F (10 min walk). Get to F, go through security, walk 10 min to just come back to see the original security checkpoint area I was supposed to go through! Absolutely unacceptable. Working for a city, my self, I am appalled at this airports lack of customer service.

Terminal employees cut in line and held the line up at check points. All Bathrooms are nasty, staff members have the worst attitude and lack professionalism.

I refer specifically to the bathroom that is next to checkpoint # 3 (American Airline). It's the dirtiest bathroom I've seen since I live in USA. I hope this serves to improve the hygiene conditions of it.

",False,"  The airport is clean and easy to navigate, you don't have to walk miles between gates. There are not so many restaurants as one might expect, but there is a sufficient variety of dining options. Arrivals: Passport control lines are long, but that is the case in most places. The ""fastrack"" option or using an automated machine and then passing a receipt to the officer actually takes longer because you have to take 5 minutes to use the machine and then join the back of the queue of people who didn't use it. As always the staff shout at you like they are herding cattle. Departures: Check-in is simple and well signposted, queues are short as there are a lot of desks. Security takes a while, the priority line is not much shorter than the main lines. As with most Americans the staff are very rude and unpleasant. One of them pointed at me and shouted ""shoes"" whilst another shook his head and announced to the waiting line ""we shouldn't have to tell y'all the obvious"". It transpired this obnoxious exchange was in fact their attempt to ask me to remove my footwear and place it in the scanning machine, something I would say about 30 percent of airports require, so to me not obvious. But perhaps it was obvious to ""y'all"".",1,MIA
2018-06-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,,it is not a pleasant airport,False,"  Can MIA achieve any level of competence? I have long boycotted it and advised others to avoid for immigration purposes, and it is not a pleasant airport to negotiate in terms of TSA security. But I did opt to use for transiting between BA6578 (operated by AA) TPA-MIA and BA0208 MIA-LHR on 21 May. On paper, I had two hours for the transit. Flying time between TPA and MIA is just 37 minutes, but weather-related issues made for a TPA departure that was 20 minutes late. On landing at MIA, we then taxied to a halt that lasted 40-45 minutes before a gate was found for us. Pax with tight connections grew anxious as we waited. The AA captain himself lost patience with the false promises of any early move to a gate. A rush to connecting gates and disgustingly dirty bathrooms ensued when we finally deplaned. BA0208 was just starting to board when I finally reached my gate. This was located in a subterranean area of stygian gloom, the waiting customers looking like lost souls, doubtless with their own negative opinions of MIA.",-1,MIA

Overall I have to say our experience at the airport was fair. It was hard to find the luggage claim area after we landed and it seems like most people there spoke Spanish. One good thing I have to say is we used www.parkon.com/mia for our airport parking reservations. Great ROI. I like that MIA is expanding and upgrading it's features.",1,MIA

",True," We went on a trip to Orlando and because we couldn't find a fair price for a flight we opted to fly out of Miami. We arrived at midnight so not much to be said about that. Arrival and luggage was ok as was the transportation to the rental cars. On the way back home however, we 'experienced' this airport. The security lines were horrible. Everyone walks around at an immensly slow speed. One person can't be bothered with helping out others. No real info on who needs to go through regular detection gates and who needs to be bodyscanned. Our carry ons were taken apart after being scanned and it took one single security officer about half an hour before he went through our stuff to check. I don't mind that my carry ons need extra screening for whatever reason but please, do it at a decent speed. The security lines were chaotic at best. Once through security I can't say the airport was dirty but the amenities were very limited as was the seating. Once home I also noticed that the TSA cut the security belt around my suitcase open with bolt cutters, even when it had a TSA lock. And they must have had a key since the suitcase as well had a security TSA lock which was correctly opened. I also put a special cloth sleeve around my suitcase to protect it from wear and scratches which I didn't even bother putting back on. When waiting, there is free WiFi but only for 45 minutes. Great when WiFi was a novelty but nowadays simply incomprehensible. Miami Airport is truly on my to-avoid-list of airports now. I guess when visiting Orlando and the airfare is to expensive, you are even better off flying to Atlanta and drive to Orlando.",-1,MIA
2018-04-29,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2.0,Took nearly 2 hours,False,"  Never change here if you can avoid it. Took nearly 2 hours to get through immigration and then we had to run through airport and push to the front of security in order to make our connecting flight (which we had already allowed a 2 hours layover for!). The staff couldn't understand what they were doing, we were queuing into an area where we had to get ESTA receipts and then 45 mins later another load of planes arrive and get guided into a similar area which is inexplicably not being used, with the result that people who had arrived 45 mins after us got through immigration quicker due to poor poor queue management. Cannot understand why those on connecting flights need to do the immigration process, transferring in the UK doesn't require this and it seems really unnecessary when you aren't even leaving the airport.",-1,MIA

As an American citizen, I can say that the Miami Internationals airport customs was the worst we experienced after visiting at least 8 other countries in Southeast Asia. Why is there not a separate line for Americans? Every other country does this. Why do I have to wait 2 hours in line so that someone can approve my customs information in 2 minutes! I pay taxes and the salaries of custom officials - foreigners don’t - so make it easy for your own citizens to pass through. How hard is that to understand. Every other country we visited understand that. But, that’s US government for you.",1,MIA

",True," From the moment we got off the plane every single employee we encountered in customs and immigration were disrespectful, rude and even down right mean. One gentleman’s job was specifically to tell people which line to filter into and yet he managed to sound extremely annoyed with every human being he came in contact with. The line was painfully long in immigration especially for the non-citizens and when I tried to ask a question to one employee she interrupted me mid question to tell me to keep walking. She treated the next two people who approached her in this same manner. The two women trying to organize the line did it by yelling and talking in bossy, annoyed tones to the hundreds of innocent people who were all just trying to do what they said. When someone made a mistake, heaven forbid if you didn’t exactly understand what “go to the end” means when the room is the size of a football field, then that poor person was berated by the employee who then walked away shaking her head as if every human was an idiot. After our first two negative interactions I started talking to my kids about how we should treat people. They could see how the employees we treating everyone and they could tell that we were just trying to obey whatever “rules” were in place to avoid being singled out. Unfortunately we saw employees act like school yard bullies well over a dozen times and didn’t see one kind exchange in the entire 2 hours that we spent in the Miami airport. Chaotic and horrible.",-1,MIA

If this is our “front door” to the world, I am embarrassed to imagine what overseas travelers must think. I have cleared customs in many other countries and they all put their best foot forward. Not so in Miami. Entire process took over two hours, airport is dirty and worms out, and never once did anyone try to assist with ensuring the process was understood. Then that had only one screening line open to get to your transfer and no TSA pre-check, so that took 45 minutes itself. We barely made our connection and had nearly a 3 hour layover! Embarrassing!",-1,MIA

The employees were just shouting directions, which were unclear and confusing. I witnessed not 1 but 2 different employees talking down to people - one of which was a man who did not speak English. They were shouting at everyone to “keep moving, don’t stop.” At the security point they told us to keep our shoes on and don’t take anything out of our carry on bags to get us through the line faster. In my opinion this jeopardises the security of everyone there for the sake of speediness. The employees were rude and the entire process of catching my conncecting flight was chaotic.",-1,MIA

The waiting time in the lines are however ridiculously long. The airport has obviously not been adapted to its increase number of customers. Waiting time going was at least 1 and a half hours. On the way back definitely shorter (30 to 45 minutes which is adequate) however at the expense of the politeness of staff. The immigration and security officers are extremely rude and obnoxious - amongst the worst I've experienced not only in the U.S.. How ironic to have staff shout ""computers ain't gonna take themselves out of bags"" and ""dont you have a flight to catch"" standing right next to a display saying that employees need to be patient and nice to travelers.

When we were at the wrong entrance we were again yelled at loud enough for everyone to hear. We got an ice cream at Haagen Daz and were ignored as the two workers chit chatted while we stood there waiting. Then there were paper liners on the inside of the cone. I went into the ladies room and the cleaning woman proceeded to yell at me as I apparently went to the side she was still cleaning on and pointed at me telling me “you! You use this side only!” A little courtesy and pleasantness goes a long way when you deal with the public. I will never use this trashy, obnoxious hole again.",-1,MIA

We arrived with no hassles as we had gone through US immigration and customs in Dublin.

Will never use this airport again. 2 hours in immigration coming back from vacation in Antigua. Then another hour through security for the 2nd time. Then to show our passports another 8 times. Common sense we wouldn't have got that far without showing our passports in Antigua. Then to run to make the final boarding call for our connecting flight.

Whilst I sat amongst the bottles and desbris on the floor, an attendant emptied the bins and strolled away. No shops or bars except a perfunctory “hut” and an awful cafe “Marseilles”. Bags of rubbish and no staff, it could be the worst in the world. I’ve been flying and traveling for 45 years and was shocked at how bad Miami is. I can’t believe that Americans put up with such standards. I can’t accurately give rating or stars There is no shopping no bars, no restraints, no redeeming features whatsoever.",-1,MIA

Signage was useless. Every member of staff I had the displeasure of meeting was hostile to the point of aggression. Information and directions were barked at travelers in an unclear and impatient manner, only for the next member of staff to bark contradicting information leading to the utter bewilderment of passengers. Although there was a large number of staff everything was chaotic and disorganised. A particular low-light of the experience was, when going through security, being told to take my shoes off, (even though I had been told to keep them on moments earlier) and place them directly on the rollers to be scanned. Predictably, seconds later the laces got stuck in the rollers. As I tried to untangle them a member of staff (rather than help) shouted at me repeatedly ""Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!"". When I explained the laces were tangled he offered no help or apology for his unnecessarily aggressive behavior. But rather stood idly watching the queue grow behind me. I have traveled through 50+ airports, and from the confrontational, incompetent and belligerent service I received, Miami is clearly ranked bottom of the pile.",-1,MIA
2018-03-01,0.4,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,I hope to avoid Miami altogether,False,"  When I arrived I was excited to see electronic passport controls. However, my passage was not so straightforward because I was not given clearance by the machine. My own fault, I had forgotten to include my middle name on my ESTA application. My friend who regularly transits through Miami says that electronic clearance may or may not help you beat the queues. I eventually reached the head of the queue and was then told to join another queue! I overheard two airport staff mocking a customer who didn't realise that she no longer needed to complete a paper landing form. Well, maybe the customer hasn't flown into the U.S. for a few years? Not a crime is it? Two ladies in the queue behind were appealing to staff because they had 1hr to clear immigration and check in for onward flight but the staff member just sneered at the customer and walked off. Waiting at the yellow line, I could see inside one of the booths where there was a male officer rocking on his chair, staring into space, ignoring the line. Rather strange behaviour. I suppose being an imigration officer must be a difficult job but I have not seen such an unfriendly bunch anywhere and I have been through Boston, New York, Washington, San Fran and Fort Lauderdale. If you are looking for something to eat at Miami airport be prepared for fast food. Next year I hope to avoid Miami altogether and travel via Panama.",-1,MIA

2018-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,airport staff were surly and rude,True," My recent experience at Miami airport when my husband and I were in transit from St Kitts to Toronto was very unpleasant and bordered on being traumatic. We joined the line to have our passports verified on the computers and were given a pass with an X on it. Therefore we had to join another very long line and have our documents verified by an agent. There was a very high volume of passengers and we felt like cattle being herded through, a term which has been used in several other reviews. While waiting, several very burly, tough looking men in uniform passed us by. It was like being in a police state. The agent who received us after a long wait in line was fine, however this was sadly an exception. Many of the airport staff we encountered were surly and rude and could not have cared less about customer service. The fact that they represent their country to a large number of travelers from around the world every day seemed to be irrelevant to them. When we went downstairs to the luggage claim area in order to go to our gate, there were a large number of more tough, burly looking men in uniform watching everyone as they were herded though the area which was intimidating to say the least. When we passed through security, one of the female security staff bawled at me in a loud voice which was totally unnecessary. I have never been spoken to in this manner in my entire life. In addition to the staff, the airport is poorly laid out and signage is confusing. We will avoid travelling via Miami airport in the future.",-1,MIA

",False,"  What an outstanding example of American arrogance and rude behaviour this dump is. To the staff: seriously, you're the first Americans that foreign visitors encounter. Why not try to at least make a small effort at being polite and friendly? The impression you give travellers is that America is filled with angry, unpleasant people - you're doing a huge disservice to your country. I witnessed a security guy being incredibly rude to the people in front of me, coming very close to actually yelling at them when all they did was turn right out of a doorway instead of left (and no signage to say otherwise). If you don't like people and have zero tolerance for other humans then stay away from a customer-facing job. Almost every staff member was rude, impatient and abrasive, all of them shouting and bullying the airport visitors. There were a few exceptions who stood out. Even though he probably sees a million people in a week, he was polite and told us to have a nice day and it made all the difference. Also, the passport guy we had was professional and friendly. It put me off ever going near America again, for a holiday or to pass through.",-1,MIA
2018-02-23,0.5,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,a shocking entrance to the US,False,"  An ok airport but a shocking entrance to the US. This airport has more staff than customers, it’s amazing how many people are employed here. Let’s talk about oddities, first thing you see when arriving in country, an immigration machine where you get a reciept to foto immigration. There are 2 huge English grammar mistakes on this, really that’s your first impression? Then there is an announcement on level 3 about “moving walks” they are called escalators in every country! Why make up child like words? 99% of the staff here are Spanish speaking which I like, but I could see how someone without Spanish may struggle. Doesn’t help I counted 3 different dialects/versions of Spanish translated on signs, confusing! Once they work out which way to face on the moving walk, seriously? Forget immigration checks, should of had IQ checks.",-1,MIA

We had over 2 hrs to make it and if I was not able to flag down one of the golf carts, we would have not made it. Going through security and customs and getting our luggage and checking it again took a lot of time. The worst was how far it was from E10, then through security, custom, etc and the long walk It must have been 2 miles long. I will never book a flight that comes from another country to this airport.",-1,MIA
2018-02-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,Chaos reigns,False,"  I'm not at all surprised to read other reviews about rude staff, bad experiences and passengers being treated like prisoners or cattle at Miami airport. Chaos reigns, and is presided over by employees who make it blatantly obvious that they hate their jobs. When we transited via Miami in January and February 2018, a handful of the staff really stood out for their competence and pleasant attitude, but they were the exception, the other 90% were miserable, surly, disinterested and in some cases quite unbelievably rude. Procedures and systems seem ridiculously slow and inefficient, and passengers have to stand in long queues multiple times as they are inhumanely processed. The layout of the airport doesn't help, signage is poor and in any case you're directed to ignore the few potentially useful signs by stressed employees whose job is apparently to stand underneath them yelling the same thing at people all day long. No wonder they're grumpy. Overall, not a positive experience at all. Anyone who arrives here is made to feel very unwelcome indeed. Come on, Miami, there has to be a better way - just look at almost any other airport.",-1,MIA

The long walk between various gates in the E concourse is unparalleled. Why not a moving floor? Why not a team that connects the entire airport, not just D concourse. The many years of construction have only produced “lipstick on a pig”. Unfortunately I need to go through there now since that is the only place you can fly from on American to St Thomas.

A customs officer was extremely rude to my wife, I and others in the group that had to go through an extra layer of scrutiny because they didn’t have the capability to check standard immigration paperwork in the standard line. The rest of the officers were rude too and treated us like prisioners. Simply unbelievable. Process took 3 hours and we missed our connecting flight. AA was gracious enough to get us on a following flight the next day but didn’t provide any type of hotel vochure, so I had to pay $125 out of pocket. Airport staff I dealt with were also rude and incompetent, with one individual advising wrong directions on two occasions. I’ll avoid the Miami airport in the future.",-1,MIA

This meant applying then attending an ""interview"" in the USA on my last trip. This was the best $100 I have ever spent.

It would take me only 15 mins if they would not ""invite"" me for a secondary interview, but thats another story. My colleague at least made it fast. Unfortunately she still waited at the luggage belt after I processed my secondary interview, one hour after landing. Perfect timing for me as just at this moment our suitcases arrived. We proceed to rental car centre, no possibility to smoke somewhere after a long flight. We need to walk around 15 mins to a people mover on a fluffy carpet which is not so easy when towing a suitcase. The people mover then took us in 5 minutes to the rental car center. Overall average experience, especially as the long waiting time for luggage sucks.",-1,MIA
2017-12-19,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,,,hellishly long security lines,False,"  
Arrived from Frankfurt at 2.40 pm after flying business class. Got to the customs and noticed ridiculosly long lines. I looked for some type of separation by class or nationality and nothing, everybody was lumped together. There were at least 500 people in that large room, all lined up line cattle to the slaughter. Really, don’t American citizens deserve an easier entry into their own country? After waiting patiently in line for 3/4 hr, got to a passport machine where my passport was read and got a receipt with an X on it, I guess they could not believe I had nothing to declare, hence I was placed into another line where a real agent would re review my entry. Waited another 15 minutes and while waiting I noticed that most agent run kiosks were assigned to X passengers. Well if this the case, why bother with the machines, they cost money and they are useless. Finally, the agent called me and he seemed very nice, talkative and accomodating. He was sure to ask me if I had anything to declare which I responded: ‘maybe a cold’. Overall uneventful but why the bureacracy, can we not do better? One thing is for sure, if I can skip Miami airport, I will be more than happy to do so. I forgot to mention the hellishly long security lines when I left 1 week prior, what a total joke.",-1,MIA

The check-in area was dirty, it was difficult to find information about amenities while waiting for check-in to open and a number of staff were quite abrupt and unhelpful when asked for help. Eating facilities were limited.

Check in was chaotic busy and slow moving. Equally security screening was long and slow with some of the most miserable employees I’ve seen in any airport, prepared to be shouted at and treated less than human.

2017-11-20,0.2,Business,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,there is a serious motivational problem,True," I was surprised at how disorganized the Airport was. The advertised free wifi was not available, the security crew was extremely rude literally hearding the passenngers thru the checks calling out things like “pay attention”, “stay focused” etc. It reminded me very much of my military drill. I have not experienced such behavior at any other US airport where TSA is usually very efficient but polite enough at the same time to make passengers comfortable. While waithing at the Business line for the security check at least three wide-body aircraft crews (= min 75 to 80 crew) were bypassed and led thru the business checks (on most other airports I have seen dedicated crew security lanes). When it was finally my turn I was redirected to the economy lane and had to wait again. At the x-ray machine there were no bins and when I dared to point this out to the TSA staffI was rebuked with “didn't you hear me!? I already called this out twice! bins are on their way”. The entire process took over 45 minutes. After the security check, the food court service staff was pleasant but the janitors and cleaning crew were very unattentive with litter piling up on many tables. Once they did come around they cleared tables even while patrons were still eating their food. Tables were not wiped and felt very sticky obviously not having been cleaned for some time. It seems to me that there is a serious motivational problem with a large number of employees at MIA that I have not witnessed on the many other US airports that I arrive to or leave from.",-1,MIA

I learned later that it is a mile from one end to the other of concourse D, a long walk for some of us. The problem was that we had no idea that there was a Skytrain we could have ridden. Unfortunately, there were no signs or any indication that there was any option other than walking. I finally asked an employee about an alternate, and was informed that the green columns in the middle of the hallways had elevators to Skytrain. No escalators. No signs. And of course there were very few passengers, since most travelers may not have even known about it. I was shocked that an airport with as much business as Miami was so poorly labeled.",-1,MIA

Didn’t bother to give clear instructions on what was expected, eg: where to stand, what was going to happen. Spent time chatting to each other.

2017-10-25,0.5,Couple Leisure,4.0,3.0,,3.0,0.0,,2.0,3.0,better than it used to be,False,"  Miami - London Heathrow, Thursday 19 October: Despite the many bad reviews this airport, in our experience, has improved greatly since the car rental centre was moved virtually on site with a short connecting shuttle train service. No more catching those awful shuttle busses with all your luggage. Also the electronic immigration machines have sped up the previously awful queueing time upon arrival. This time we flew back to the UK with Virgin Atlantic: driving in with the aid of SatNav and the very few road signs we got to the car rental hub without any issues. Put the luggage into a storage facility until we could check in with Virgin - we were a bit early so first in the queue - and got through security after about 1/2 hour. Travelling Upper Class so found the Lounge and did not bother with the many, many fast food outlets, sports bars or coffee places. The big downside of Miami Airport has always been the crowded concourses and very poor signage - only seems marginally better now. The WiFi was also slow. But all things considered the airport is better than it used to be. Tip: If you don't have access to a lounge or have a few hours to kill there is an open air cafe/bar on the top floor of the Hotel that we used to go to. It also connects to an indoor bar with sports screens and air - con. I believe you can pay to use the Health Club and use the pool as well, and the view over the runways is spectacular.",1,MIA

Getting your passport stamp takes a long long time, they only have one person working and the guy took ten minutes for each passenger. I almost didn't make my connection to Atlanta due to slow and unorganized airport. After you get your passport stamped you will have to get your lugguage and drop it to your transfers which most airport do.

This is by far the worst airport on the planet when you travel internationally. From arrival to immigration they're just way behind the curve and never seem to care. At least 50% of the time upon arriving the airplane has to sit on the tarmac waiting for a gate to open. This messes with peoples' connections and plans. The immigration system is run by a bunch of morons. The officers are just fine, but the employees directing you and the way in which it is all arranged is just mind-boggling.

We were held in long snaking queues for three hours until we missed our connecting flight. Staff were unhelpful and intimidating, not answering any questions, just barking orders. After missing our flight we had to spend the night there in the freezing airconditioning with no instructions or help as to what we could do or where to go.

No transit facility (meaning travelers passing through the US mingle with domestic travelers). Gate to Carousel is usually at least half a mile distance. (Gate 48 to Carosel 26). The last 8 flights from LGA to MIA have arrived with no gate available (over capacity). Signs say Baggage Claim both ways (left and right - one way uses the train, one way by foot - why not write 'Baggage Claim - Via Train) when you leave the aircraft. Credit Card and Sunpass lanes to exit parking are regularly broken. Greed and disorganization rule. I've used airports in every continent and this ranks in the worst 3. AA lounge dates to about 1992.

And why are there 10 gates for every small bathroom? Unanswerable questions I guess. I have never had worse food at an airport than when I reluctantly buy food here, so I do it as seldom as possible. Seats in the terminal must be 30 years old, ripped. Tons of shops, whick is a plus for some, but I'm not interested in paying a premium price for anything so to me shopping is not very useful.

We had to queue for more than 2.5 hours. The agent was on his mobile sending and receiving texts while checking our passports. I don't think workers should be allowed to use mobile phones while at work. On our way back the security staff were extremely impolite, talking to passengers in a very rude manner.

Poor mobility between terminals plus a new complaint. The hike from American Airlines baggage area to terminal J is still a lomg walk. No trams or walkways, zero! Poor planning.

My flight arrived at 5pm and I was back at airside 35 min later. Immigration was fast which took about 10-15 min and walked through customs as bags had cheked through with ITI-tags.

Perfect. This time it was a disaster. All passengers were directed through the automatic passport / fingerprint / photo machines. There were reasonable queues, but all fine. Normally one then takes the printed strip through the ""quick"" channel, it gets glanced at and you are in. However, this time, every single foreign visitor had to pass through the full immigration check - and there were only a handful of immigration officers present - literally 5 or 6. This meant queues of literally 2 plus hours minimum. I was one off the first off the plane and it took me two hours ten minutes. Others will have waited for 3+ hours It was shambolic and awful.

This place looks so dingy and old, it was like stepping back in time! I travel worldwide and it was one of the worst airports I have seen. Flew Iberia out of the E wing. Once you go past security there is very little in the way of food options or shops. It consisted of Pizza Hut, a small beer place, and two freestanding snack stands. That was it. When I got out to the actual gate, there was nothing. There were a few ""stores"" but they weren't open and I don't know if they are even functional. It was for a 5.30pm flight which ended up being delayed. There were bathrooms, and seating, but nothing else. Everything was closed up. There were 4 different gates where I was. There was a business class lounge not too far for Iberia business passengers, or American Airlines. At this area they did have a duty free shop which was small. The waiting area was fairly clean and the seats were comfortable enough. You have 30 minutes of free wifi after that you have to pay for it. I was early for my flight so the line to go through security and waiting to check in were not long. I had to take a short train to get out to the gates. This airport is serious need of an overhaul. It looks like the 1960's. The buses are in one area on the lower level. Depends on the airline you fly which terminal you are out of.",-1,MIA

It is old. It is slow. Everything is disorganized. Having to change planes and go back through security is asinine. Absolutely nobody at any point in time was kind or helpful from American Airlines to security to asking for help from airport staff. Not one person said hello or even cracked a smile.

We have gone through early morning (6:30 am), so my experience may not be typical, but we had no issues. Everything moved pretty quickly. We actually had a 7 hour layover (thanks, American Airlines!) so we had plenty of time to wander and not be rushed. Overall, I think the signage was good, and the one staff member we asked a question was polite and gave us good directions. We ate at the Irish pub in the American Airlines section of the terminal. The food was good and reasonably priced for an airport restaurant. I know many people have had bad experiences at this airport, but ours was pretty positive.",1,MIA

My first arrival was at 4pm from an international flight. The queue for APC machines was very long and a staff member directed us to the immigration desks, the queues here also looked horrendous, a helpful staff member asked if anyone had connections which said yes and she gave us a fast track orange voucher which enabled us jump the queue (our connection time was 2 hours). We had only carry ons so had no bags to collect, but had to go through security again, which was slow considering the queues were not long. From deplaning to clearing immigration and security took about an hour thanks to fast track voucher. As we were traveling business class we went to to business lounge rather than use any of the dining outlets. We arrived at MIA again a few days later.

2019-06-24,0.5,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,there's not many staff,True," I showed up to MLU for my morning flight. I was there in plenty of time and I have flown out of Monroe multiple times. A family in front of me was buying tickets for a flight tomorrow. I waited and waited. Apparently, the woman at the counter, (the only one working) thought I was with the family. Once she realized I wasn't with the family, she tried to get someone to help me but no one was there. I waited long enough to miss the time to check a bag. Finally, a man came to help, but immediately gave me a spill about being on time so I can check my bag next time. I was polite, but I've done this many times. Let's just say the woman working was not happy with him. She tried to help me and I don't think it was her fault that no one was there to help her. I had to wait from 9:40-4:30 to catch the next flight. I guess it is a small airport, so there's not many staff. I think the problem could be prevented.",-1,MLU
2022-10-31,0.6,Solo Leisure,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,honestly not a bad airport,True,"  Mobile Regional (MOB) is honestly not a bad airport, even if it's showing some signs of age. The signage leading to anywhere a passenger needs to go is mostly straightforward (except for signage to short-term parking for some reason), though some of it is older and fading. Parking is easy and relatively cheap compared to airports in larger metros. The entry into the terminal is one covered passageway. Checking in luggage is painfully easy at one of three small counters. Going through security is easy with small lines, and painfully easy if you have TSA Pre-Check. There are only seven departure gates total and 2-3 stores post-security. One of those stores is one that almost everyone has to walk past or through on the way to their gate: Hudson News pairing up with a tiny restaurant and bar, equipped with cafeteria-style seating. It looks like the set of the old TV show ""Wings,"" or perhaps a miniature version of a 1990s mall food court. This makes the airport so small that it's quirky. The personnel working in this airport are sweet and warm - yes, in an airport! As for the drawbacks, some of the ceilings post-security are quite low, with the lighting dim. Only some of the pre-security area looks like it's seen any renovation since the 1990s. The signage from I-65, and most of Airport Boulevard until you reach the airport, is almost nonexistent. MOB's location is so far out in the western suburbs that it's really quite inconvenient, whether you're coming from Mobile or other Gulf area cities in Alabama and Mississippi. Mobile Downtown Airport is expected to open in 2024 and should be a vast improvement in terms of modernity and accessibility.",1,MOB
2019-05-01,0.7,Business,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,You want to be here only to leave,True," The biggest plus for Monterey Airport is its size. This is probably the smallest airport I have ever seen. What that means is fast airport screening. Curb to your gate, including clearing security, is less than five minutes. Got it? Less than Five Minutes! On the negative side, the airlines treat the airport as a step-child. Until recently United used to fly its throw-away planes here for the Pebble Beach class masses. This is slightly unusual as there are a hell of a lot of big wigs from Fortune 500 coming in for Golf and right now the Centennial celebration at Pebble Beach. Up until this month, nearly every airplane you flew on was sketchy, dodgy, a throw away plane from once upon a time, long long time ago. That is the class of airplanes coming in and out of here. Not very good. The Airline personnel on more than a few occasions were nowhere to be found. Just not there. And you look around and it looks like a ghost town in there. Really - no body there. The On-Time in bound and out bound is about - lets just say - add 1 to 5 hours to your scheduled departure or arrival. Its very obvious Monterey Airport is not a priority for the major airlines. My guess is that they are thinking if you really are a Big Wig, then you really shouldn't be flying commercial. Fly your own Jet. The services at terminal itself is - well - lets just say - it looks like an 8th grader set up a Lemonade Stand. There is one gift shop. Next door is a 7 Eleven type of place with hand made signs all over and evidence that its a one person operation. There is basically two terminals. You go left or you go right, from the scan stations. And both of these terminals are very dark. What fluorescent lighting there is here does not add to the mood of it being very dark. It sports a couple of dated TV's hanging way too close to the roof. Its a little strange - the terminals. It could definitely use some better Feng Shui. Some art perhaps. Something to make it seem more human, than ""Here is a terminal, you wanted one, here it is. It's up to code. They have lights."" The restaurant upstairs looks like it could use a renovation. Its furniture and carpet look very 1980's. I'd put money on it that the furniture and carpet is at least a few decades old. Definitely not new. Its important to note, it is not inside the gate, but outside it. The parking here, for a small airport, is pretty steep. About $13 / day long term. $20 - 25 / day Short term. Yes, that is steep. For a tiny airport flying with the average one flight per hour. This airport definitely could use some sponsor subsidizing. Bring in some of the Golf companies. Advertise it as their lounge. Why not? Thats how all the majors work. Sponsorship. Make this thing look a charming, cozy, Tiger Woods world class than midwest airport hick woods class. Clearly the airport has some negatives. Usually at nice airports you want to arrive early and spend some time in there because its such a joy. This is not one of those Airports. You want to be here only to leave. Why am I giving it 7 Stars? Its tiny and convenient. And if it ever were updated with better airplanes and facilities, it would get 10 Stars easily.",1,MRY

In the international arrival hall > 500 people, 3 officers to check passports, > 2 hours waiting. In civilized countries, usually helpers are asking passengers about tight connections and help them through to catch their flights. The assistants here were few and could not care less about us. The luggage’s checked in and out for customs - the re- check points with other assistants (watching their phones) directing passengers how to put their luggage on the right position - not helping or moving a finger in the process. Security - same rude treatment: we supposed to push our bags through the tunnel - at the flashing red light - who would know? workers standing there and screaming at us, not helping at all. I had to run like crazy to catch my flight and I would have never be able to do it without the help of a kind fellow passenger.

Then at the Arrivals/Baggage Claim the cars are double, triple parked and will sit there for 20, 30, 40 minutes blocking traffic and making it impossible to load your car. We saw some cars just sitting there for over an hour while our man went to get our rental car. Security is non-existant, we never saw a guard until some dude threatened us while we were trying to back our car in to load, then one slow-witted airport security dude shows up, and basically does nothing because ""that's always how it is here...and I'm supposed to be on my break."" Eventually four real police arrived to deal with a situation that never should have happened in the first place. Try double parking at LAX Arrivals for longer than three minutes and see what happens. Stop letting people quadruple park at Arrivals before someone gets violent, because it will happen eventually if it hasn't yet. This airport is obviously poorly managed, and security is lazy.",-1,MSP

I witnessed an extremely elderly couple arrive at the TSA que. They were traveling alone and obviously had trouble getting around. They did not have the correct boarding documents, but instead of showing compassion, or helpfulness, the airport employee yelled at them and told them to get out of line & go back to the ticketing counter. The elderly woman asked if her husband could wait there ( he had a very hard time walking) but the grouchy employee said,” No, you have to take him with you! I don’t have anywhere to stash him!” Like he was a piece of luggage or something. Next she ordered me & my family to a TSA booth that didn’t have an agent manning it. We stood there briefly, looking to see if an agent was coming. Next we stepped to the next agent to show our ID & boarding passes. She charged over to us and told us to stay where she put us! I pointed out that there was NO agent where she sent us, and she proceeded to start stomping around barking out orders.

Having traveled extensively in my 59 years, I have to say that MSP is one of the most ill-designed and unfriendly airports in the world. Yesterday I walked 2+ miles to my connection, the moving walkways not operating. Every single time I’ve flown to/from/thru MSP in the past 30 years there has been an issue. Entering the States from Europe several times we were detained in security for 3 or more hours, our kids taken to the other side of the room while we were interrogated. Never has this happened at any other airport in the world on our travels. Last time we waited for 20 minutes for a French translator to come to read the label on a can of foie gras to determine if it contained pork.  You need to do better MSP!

2022-06-17,0.6,Business,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Not a bad airport but not a great one,False,"  Not a bad airport but not a great one. Getting from the outer C Concourse to the main terminal is not intuitive (there is a train I would have missed if not for the help of a local). Directions to Light Rail are not entirely intuitive and the airport maps online are absolutely useless for figuring out how to get from the Light Rail to the gates. The food selection is ok but not what I would expect at a hub airport. Ditto the shopping. Security was quick with little wait in the TSA or regular lines. I used Delta, which is the dominant carrier here. The service was okay. The thing with Delta is that they are pretty inept at their home base in Atlanta, but often better elsewhere, The most remarkable thing here was that one person managed the gate ---this may be a legacy of Northwest (which Delta acquired). Delta's legacy facilities usually have two people at the gate with one often more inept than the other (DCA and ATL). This is an ok airport of you can figure out the logistics.",1,MSP

As we were going through security she was pushed off to the side and left there for 20 minutes. My sisters and I started to complain after about 15 minutes and were told to be patient. Then after 25 minutes of mom sitting there as everyone passed her by we really started complaining about missing our flight. Finally we were told to find a manager where about 5 people were standing at a podium. There was a lady there with red hair visiting that came to help us. It then took another 15 more minutes to get mom passed through security. We missed our pre-board time and were told at the gate that she should have pre-boarded. Well no kidding. This was very stressful for my family and especially my mom. This should never be the case that she is singled out and made to feel like an annoyance in an airport on vacation.,1,MSP

There’s no instructions for what to do when you get up to security, yet they got extremely angry when people weren’t able to read their minds regarding their expectations.

The signs are somewhat confusing and, as a result of COVID, some of the Information Desks are closed. I found an open Information Desk, but the staff member was so mean I chose to figure out things on my own rather than be belittled by him for getting lost.

In any case, be prepared to give quite a bit of time to make to your connecting gate. The food outlets are not evenly spaced out which also means quite a bit of going to and fro in search of a bite.

2019-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,disappointing traveling experience,True,"  I was returning from vacation with my husband and 2 kids from Cancún. When we arrived at 7:21pm at the airport and registered at the kiosk Delta agent told us to go to the left line where the line was very long and foreigners with non-us passport were standing. We were last in the line and the line was not moving. I saw everyone else from our plane were on the other line and were already checked out and got their luggage and we were still standing at the end of the line with about 40 people in front of us. When I asked one of the Delta agents and told her there must be some kind of a mistake cause we’ve been waiting for more than an hour and everyone else from our flight is on the other line she told me it’s because my husband has a foreign passport and because it has an x written on it so we have to stay in that line. I told her we’re family of 4 and my 2 kids and i have us passports but she said we have to stay in that line and wait. I was so upset because of the long wait, I was sick, and the fact we had to drive back home to Fargo which is 4 hours away from Minneapolis but no one seemed to care even when I physically walked over to the security guard and told him about our situation he told me rudely to go back to my family and wait. When everyone finally left and we came to check out the agent was so rude to me and told me to complain to his boss who was by the way a nice gentleman and when i explained to him that we live in States and my two kids and I have passports and my husband has his Bosnian passport and a green card he then asked if we have shown the Delta agent his green card. I said we didn’t because we were never asked for it. He then said that Delta agent should’ve sent us to the faster line because my husband had sufficient docs. He aldo said that I can complain to Delta supervisor at the front with the red suit on. I saw the lady and when asked if she’s a delta supervisor and she said yes I explained what had happened and why I’m upset. She very calmly said sorry but that her agents are fully trained. It wad pretty clear to me then that she wasn’t interested in my story or that she cared, let alone admit the fault.

We flew out of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport yesterday morning. We had a 6:50 am flight and arrived to return our rental car at 5:20. When we entered Terminal 1 we were shocked to see the security lines running both directions down the center of the terminal. One line had even doubled back on itself. I have never seen such long lines at any airport! (I hope it was due to bad weather the past few days and the need to reschedule people who missed flights but the security line would have taken at least 1 1/2 hours to get through) My husband and I have pre-check but my elderly parents ( early to late 80's) did not so he went through to our gate to make sure he could catch the flight for work while I stayed in the security line to help them. The line was moving very slowly and I became concerned that we might be in the wrong line. I asked a security officer near me if indeed I was headed in the right direction and expressed my concern that we would miss our flight. He said I was in the correct line and asked if I possibly had pre-check. I explained that I did but my parents didn't and that I needed to stay to help them through security and on the flight. He kindly had us follow him to another line where we were able to get through security as our flight was continuing the boarding process. We were able to grab a courtesy cart, as our gate was a long walk from the security checkpoint. We arrived at our gate just as boarding was finishing. I am so grateful for the help.",-1,MSP

I was appalled to experience such a disgustingly dirty ladies restroom in Minneapolis! The stalls had either no toilet tissue or barely any, with only the last remains of a role in a few. There were no hand towels in the dispensers and just one paper towel role setting on the wet sink counter. Plus, there was a good amount of water on the floor.

I love this terminal, it is simple, easy and although it does not have the space of Terminal 1 or all of the amenities, it is a breeze. At MSP, Terminal 2 was added as an expansion and it has since been expanded to 14 gates and it is essentially a large hallway with very simple parking and a few restaurants. The terminal is small but that is also it's best appeal, it is so easy to navigate and spend time in. I have been through domestic and international departures and arrivals and it has just been easy, the way it should be. Parking is simple, one of two ramps, Orange or Purple, park your vehicle, walk across the skyway and you are in. If you are on the side with security open, you just walk into security if you do not need to check a bag and you already have your ticket. Once you are through security, find your gate (not that hard, there are only 14 of them) and go get something to eat. The food is good and mostly local to Minneapolis but be aware that the airport's amenities do not open until 5am, the restaurants open later than that. I ran into this problem with an early Sun Country flight to Cancun. Arrival is pretty much just as easy, you'll be in the airport just long enough to get your bags and a cup of coffee and then walk across the skyway and get in your car. Sun Country and Southwest are the primary carriers out of Terminal 2 and there are a few others as well. I do wish Delta would have a few flights out of this terminal, it would make things much easier for some passengers.",1,MSP

Baggage check-in is pretty efficient, security lines move quickly, (and there is plenty of room both before and after the scanners), and there are a lot of varied options for eating and shopping in the terminals. My only real complaint on this trip was a lack of clear signage to get to the rental car area from the main terminal. There were signs for ""ground transportation"", but nothing that said ""rental cars"" until you were practically there. It took a couple of wrong turns before I got to the tram and got the car. Getting back to the arrivals pick-up area where my wife and bag were waiting took a good 15 minutes due to lane closures from construction. Other than that, the experience was good, as usual.

They have a beautiful full bar and restaurant at the gate we were waiting for hours. I went up to ask for a pint and was directed to order via the iPad. I asked if I could just pay cash and was denied. I think MSP needs to be careful not to get so technologically full of themselves as to restrict business. The iPads on all the tables photograph really well as high-tech, but make the assumption that all people want to go through the tedious process of online ordering.

2024-08-10,1.0,Couple Leisure,5.0,3.0,,5.0,0.0,,,5.0,I am grateful for being helped,False,"  My experience with United Airlines at New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport was ramping up towards a masterclass of poor professional service and lack of customer empathy. When a delay came up for my initial flight, I spoke to a remote agent who ultimately said, ""tough luck"" and didn't provide any options. There was no empathy and no discussion of any options to make it home safely. You can imagine I was scared and anxious when my flight to return home was nowhere in sight. Luckily, at United's desk, the representative Anna, who also worked at United, was present. She is the epitome of the perfect professional. She used critical listening to understand my concern and problem-solved on the spot. She gave me an option to return home safely. This wasn't a testament to United training, because it seems like the rep prior routinely told me ""tough luck,"" but it showed how much of a true professional AND good person Anna is. I am grateful for being helped by Anna at New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport, who works at United Airlines. If any problem arises, and she is present, best believe she will give you the most ultimate and efficient service.",1,MSY

I can confidently say that in terms of international airports this place is probably the worst. There is nothing whatsoever to recommend it. The location is bad. It's been under construction for more than a decade, resulting in the removal of the limited seating and amenities they formerly had in the outer areas where you wait and pick people up. Staff are uniformly rude, uninformed and/or just plain incompetent. It's badly organized and unattractive. There's very little to nothing in the way of assistance for things like ground transport, rental cars and the like. And they don't have that many flights. So the only reason to use this airport is if you absolutely have to go to New Orleans. If you're flying out, including overseas, use Gulfport or somewhere else and avoid this dump.",-1,MSY

Traveled with someone who left their purse (with identification and the whole nine in it) in a bathroom and we were sent on a wild goose chase to find someone who was even willing to help us retrieve it. We were met with horrible attitudes and treated like a bother by everyone we encountered and were even told by multiple employees “I can’t help you with that”, and after being sent to them by another employee at that! If it weren’t for the law enforcement office we would not have received any help at all. Not being able to help is one thing, but being rude and completely unwilling to help is another.

2023-01-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,poorly thought out billion dollar fiasco,False," Nearly everything is wrong with this airport. But special disdain goes to the rental car location (30 minutes away!) and that the shuttles drop you off at baggage claim for departure. Then there is a long brisk walk and 2 escalators to get to check in where there is a line all the way to the door. We slipped outside and did curbside check in. (The only nice person in the airport was at the curbside check in for Southwest). TSA is very nasty here too, and not empathetic at all. There seems to be tons of wasted space and open areas and very little space that is actually useful. The MSY airport had been remodelled after Hurricane Katrina and it was quite nice back them. Why ruin it for this poorly thought out billion dollar fiasco? It has a very generic look. There is barely any seating except at the terminal. The restaurants and shops are like mall kiosks. For a brand new airport there are few modern conveniences. I feel huge sympathy for anyone elderly or with a disability, this airport is not for you! Really its not for anyone",-1,MSY

All passengers have to go through big lines, it’s only one way to get to all gate access, one hour+ is an average wait time just to get by the security check and another 30 to 40 minutes for the security check. Most ridiculous set up I have ever seen. I hope I would never have to come back here again. I still at the line writing review … it’s been an hour, I hope I won’t miss my flight. One more thing to add, if you are retiring a rental car that you picked up from another location good luck with that, add some extra time, you will not know where to drop, you be be lost, your phone GPS can be your best option.",-1,MSY

Words just cannot describe how poor this airport design is. It is almost like a real life experiment on the way an airport could be designed to make customers walk the most, be disorganized, crowded in little walkways that go to plain ugly open spaces, have to be jammed up tightly to retrieve luggage, have a terrible time finding a restroom. Customers with bladder issues need diapers because there will not be a conveniently located restroom. Perhaps they should include a vending machine for them. It is really scary that it isn't an experiment but a new facility, opened November 2019 at a cost of 1.3 billion dollars. If I could rate a negative number I would.",-1,MSY

2022-04-09,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Totally ridiculous,True," My 15 yo daughter and I were made to feel as though we were being prepared for a maximum security federal prison sentence. This is not the first time NOLA TSA has made us feel this way but I can say with certainty it will be the last, we will never fly from this airport again. They were rude (as usual), cold, uncaring and borderline verbally abusive. You feel like you are in a foreign country with laws you may not understand that could cause you to be arrested. My daughter had fresh torn ligaments and had an orthopedic boot in place. She was barely able to walk on it but managed so we didn’t have the extra burden of crutches. When we approached the first TSA “Agent”, and I use that term loosely, he was so inhuman, unkind and snapped at me about where to place my phone to have my boarding pass scanned. The TSA agent repeating the same unclear instructions again does not explain to me how to do something. Then we had to prepare to be x-rayed, we placed our items in the bins (do that right or you will get yelled at- speaking from previous experience), my daughter was told to take off her shoe but she could leave the boot. She did as told. Entering x-ray, the other very young, poorly trained, rude TSA agent instructed her to remove the ortho boot. I explained she can not do that, she can not stand without the boot. She made her do it anyway, they sent it thought the conveyer x-ray. She stood there approx 3 min, alone, with no support (they would not allow me in to assist her and they would rather die than show some compassion and offer a chair or a helping hand) her right leg was trembling, her affected ankle was in pain from removing the orthopedic boot, I was left to feel helpless. Finally wen the boot scan was complete, I was able to assist with putting it back on. It was extremely painful. In my profession, we are required to go through sensitivity training to make sure our customers always feels safe and to understand how to treat people with respect and kindness. NOLA TSA needs sensitivity training and they to be held accountable for their terrible treatment to passengers! They act as though they are the highest authority in the land and they are untouchable. Totally ridiculous. We rarely travel and to have them start my vacation like that was just unnecessary. If the government officials cared anything about that city, they would prevent their citizens and visitors from being treating like this.",-1,MSY

My boyfriend and I came to New Orleans for our anniversary. We enjoyed our trip until we arrived at the New Orleans airport to depart. We arrived 1 hour and 45 mins before our flight was scheduled to leave. We checked in out bags in 15 mins and headed to the TSA check in area. We waited 1 hour and 20 mins in line just to get through airport security. We finally made it to the lady to get our id and boarding pass checked 20 mins before the plane was scheduled to leave (5 mins before boarding was over). The worst part was we still had to place our items on the scanner and be scanned through as well. By the time we finished it was 12 mins before the plane was scheduled to leave (3 mins after boarding was over). We ran and made it at 5.50 am for our 6.00 am flight. The gate was closed. Although the plane was there they were not allowing anyone else to board the plane. We missed our flight. And could not get another flight for the rest of the day. This airport is low staff, low resources, no urgency at all or care for the customers and flight times. It’s unorganized and ruined the entire experience of New Orleans. We were not accommodated nor were arrangements made for us. This is very poor customer service and we will not be returning again.",-1,MSY

Passengers huddle behind the few available walls to shield themselves from the blinding sunlight flowing in unfiltered through voluminous windows. There is no place to hide. Inadequate seating.

However, did you recycle the toilet seats from the old airport? The disgusting plastic that you have to click the green button? Well, the one in my stall was jammed!

The bathroom toilet fixture was broken, dusty and the trash bin was full with a dirty bandaid on top. The floors were dirty. It was very apparent they had not really cleaned the floors. For a new airport, I was disappointed on the conditions of the airport cleanliness. The white columns are dirty around the floor base as well and the hook on the door to the bathroom was broken. As someone who was excited about the new airport, lack of care was disappointing. In comparison to ATL, DFW, JAX, DEN, PDX, FLL, TOA, MCO, this airport's cleanliness is below standards.",1,MSY
2020-02-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,,4.0,the TSA set up was a giant fail,False,"  Poor design in passenger drop off and pick up areas. Absolutely a mess and people were so frustrated that no one could move that it became dangerous. The ticketing area was fine but the TSA set up was a giant fail as well. The agents could check people faster than the lines could clear through the scanners so the agents sat idle much of the time and the entire line just was in a dead lock. Once inside I noticed there were only a few restrooms (2 per terminal), all with very long lines (on a Tuesday mid-morning). Gate seating areas were ridiculously undersized for number of passengers on a plane. There was seating for about 50 with the gates directly next to us both filled with their own passengers so people just sat on the floor in the walkways. Not safe! If they intended for overflow to go into next gate they have to plan for that in staggering schedules. Overall I really don't understand why they built this. It is undersized for current needs with no room for growth in the industry. The trend is more people traveling and they seem to be expecting the opposite. Pretty much frustrated with poor scaling the entire morning. We are told to get there with much time to spare (by TSA) but there is no where to go. I will avoid this airport whenever possible. Yes it was pretty.",-1,MSY
2020-01-24,0.1,Business,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,it is filthy,False,"  The new airport in New Orleans is a beautiful structure - the architect Cesar Pelli did a wonderful job. Everything else was designed by hacks and engineers no doubt selected for their political patronage - because they obviously have no design talent. The garages and drives and signage are not any better than third world airports. Think Orlando, Chicago and Miami airport landscaping and signage - all beautifully designed and maintained- not New Orleans - no design talent anywhere outside of the terminal - a waste of a billion dollars! The biggest problem with this 10 week old terminal is that it is filthy - I have been through the airport 4 times since it opened in November and I can attest that the floors have not ben cleaned once since opening. The same stains and dirt piles are on the floors. They have been swept clean by the lazy airport staff, but never washed clean. What a shame after the efforts put into the design and great layout. Atlanta and Detroit airports are all run by similar politically connected vendors- but they are spotlessly clean and beautiful. The New Orleans folks just don’t care about being clean - what a shame. Maybe the mayor is a slob and doesn’t know what clean is - because if she ever traveled anywhere else - she would understand that you need to clean floors every door when millions walk in them. Slobs - all slobs. Wake up New Orleans and clean this building!",-1,MSY

No signs in airport to direct you to where food might be if you don't want an expensive sit down restaurant. People in and out of airport are rude. Taxi cab people were screaming at tourists yesterday, 1/14/20. Lines are long for taxi. Uber and Lyft had at least 100 people in it. Only one lane for taxi and arrivals to depart. When my ride picked us up it took 24 minutes to get out of airport area and headed to interstate. The one lone security officer directing the gridlock blew his whistle constantly at people trying to pick up their passengers. There were several people arguing in rideshare line because of long lines and no line organization. I flew on southwest 561 from LGA.",-1,MSY

Take the rental car signs off the airport parking direction signs! I drove around the airport parking lot 3 times following the rental car signs before I finally saw an employee sitting off in the cut and asked how to get to the rental car lot. She got annoyed when I didn’t understand her lackluster directions (take a right at the light and then another right?) and said “I don’t know” and turned away from me. Finally found a >10in. sign with no lighting by it that said rental car return. Horrible. Doubt if I'll ever come to New Orleans again and if I have to, I’ll drive.",-1,MSY

During rush hour add an extra hour or two to your trip. There is only one way in and one way out and it’s bumper to bumper. Also, long lines to go through security. No seats at baggage claim.

This new airport is literally the worst I've been in a long time, and I travel all the time throughout the year! The signs are a complete joke, and they're incorrectly placed/marked from the time you begin pulling into the driveway! Literally terminal and parking signs, departure and arrival signs, and even the arrows on the signs for the exits are incorrectly marked and/or posted directionally! The old MSY was laid out much more efficiently and effectively than the new one! We were disappointed the time we arrived and then again 5 days later when we departed as well! We should've known with this state and city what to expect, and it was no surprise the lack of concern the staff showed either! Thank God for the kiosks at the ticket counters because hopefully these will replace some of the atrocious, rude, lazy staff that you currently have in place! That'll be a huge improvement for you guys, so I can't wait for this continued transition! We also waited 40 minutes from the time we deplaned for our luggage! I've had bags miss flights I was on make it on the plane behind us arrive more quickly than this! Terrible customer service! Your employees legitimately don't seem to care. Overall, I'd honestly give this airport experience a D-. We will be flying from BTR going forward! At least they're courteous and seem to care more than MSY!

Given the importance of New Orleans we were shocked by how poor the whole airport experience was: Extremely poor signage, Dirty floors, the carpeted areas were particularly filthy. Toilets were disgraceful, loose fixings, unpleasant smells, inadequate drying facilities. Food outlets were shameful, unreasonably expensive, restricted choices, staff had a totally 'couldn't care less' attitude.

I have travelled a great deal and never have I encountered such disgusting toilet facilities. No locks on the doors, taps not working, no paper towel.

Departure, waiting in line, is the usual waste of life. The thing that turns me sideways is the baggage handling on arrivals, it is almost as if they do it on purpose, seems the handlers get together and discuss just how they can annoy the passengers. I traveled with three other couples on a trip here and there. This trip back from the national parks in Utah was the worst yet when it came to getting our baggage. Walked off the plane at 9.52 pm and 48 minutes later the planes luggage started in on the wrong belt, it came in on a different one that was labeled for the flight. 48 minutes to get luggage from the plane to the belt. The flight took 160 minutes to move one thousand five hundred and ten miles, it took the baggage handlers 48 minutes to move luggage just hundreds of feet. I do not understand what can be the problem, other than incompetence and lack of concern by the airport/airlines. Oh! If you do not pay attention to what the bottom of you luggage looks like, I would recommend that you learn what it looks like from the bottom, because each and every time your luggage comes down the moving belt it will be upside down. Do you take time to consider how you pack your bag, you know, the stuff you don't mind getting mashed you put on the bottom, well your bag will travel upside down anyway so it doesn't matter how you pack it. The baggage handlers suck at what they do. I hold the airport and the airline responsible. Southwest needs to straighten up. In this review, I have given the individual review categories all one star, having to wait on your luggage for way to long of a period takes away from the experience as a whole.",-1,MSY

Consistently poorly operated, poorly signed, filthy, mismanaged, disorganized, and unkempt. These values are reflected quite adequately in the airport. Add to that long lines even for TSA Pre-Check (TSA seem to want to take their precious times), unpleasant personnel for the most part, and the feeling the airport hasn't been renovated or even cleaned since circa 1986, and, well, I think you can envision this airport if you've never been there. Get it together, New Orleans and Louisiana by first ""un-corrupting"" your governments. On the bright side, with the exception of St. Tammany Parish way off in the North Shore, the airport is probably the safest part of the metropolis.",-1,MSY

I have metal in my body which I told the TSA, once I was cleared they went through the full body detector, the airport's wheelchair went thru and beeped. Instead of checking the wheelchair, which they claimed they did but I didn't see it, I was patted down. Really!

Completely disorganized, TSA was unnecessarily rude and everything in total disarray. The building is grotesquely outdated and nothing runs properly. Missed my flight because of the total incompetence of the airport, and specific airline (American Airlines) utter failure to warn customers of the condition, i.e. slow security check, despite acknowledging they were familiar with the situation.

When I asked one of the TSA agents how much longer the wait would be when I observed them putting someone ahead of me, she told me “not on your time”. With her multi coloured hair and unprofessional attitude. I don’t know how some of these unprofessional people were hired at an airport to be amongst mass population.

We are seasonal travelers and fly in and out if many airports frequently each year. The TSA agent was a large lady that yelled at the people in the line then came up behind me and my husband and small children and screamed directly in my ear to move faster. My kids were terrified and were moving so fast as it was that they were frantically picking up their suitcase to put on the belt for screening. My youngest went through in tears she was so terrified. When I told the agent that we were moving quickly to be patient with us she threatened to hold me in a cell and not let me Board an airplane for talking back to her. I was in complete shock at our experience. I have never been treated so poorly in all our hundreds of travels across the world. We will never fly through this airport again. Our experience was the worst! And continued on to the other agents working there. Customer service must not be taught here.,-1,MSY

Check in desks poorly signed manned by rude and unhelpful staff. As a regular world traveller the check in process was the slowest I have ever experienced. Security was further struggle. No attention paid to orderly lines, and manned by by shouting bullying staff. The experience deteriorated further airside. Limited outlets for food and drink, with long lines to purchase.

For lack of better terms, MSY airport is a disgrace. Parking is a nightmare, the airline staff we have personally dealt with have not been friendly or very helpful and TSA is incredibly rude at this particular airport.

The staff at the restaurants are slow or rude. My friend waited forever at subway. I saw a bunch of people waiting in line at a cheesecake place, and the worker was sitting down at a table on her phone (it’s 7:00 am, and opening wasn’t long ago). The bathrooms in the D concourse smell like cigarette smoke. The carpets are filthy. For security, each concourse is separate. So you have to go through twice to go to B and wait, and then to D. It’s really inconvenient, even with pre-check. I’ve never felt disgusted at an airport in the United States ... until now. I hope they finish the new terminal soon, so people aren’t left (or greeted) with the absolute worst impression of this great city.",-1,MSY

Getting through security was a breeze (very friendly TSA), and compared to other airports I've been to, navigating is easy enough. If you are someone who goes to the airport not just to fly but to shop mountains of stuff this airport might not be for you, granted it has somewhere between 15 and 20 gates total, and there is no gargantuan walkway of duty-free shops to be found. The terminal is very modern and clean. For some reason, despite being first in line for takeoff, it did take us about 15 min to get off of the ground. Lots of general aviation, so this might be a regular thing. Bottom line, would I fly here? Absolutely. This airport is all about convenience and efficiency.",1,MYR

On the return trip layover, I made the mistake of stopping by a Mexican restaurant. The menu was limited and food tasted like re-heated frozen food. The layout is poorly thought-out. The queues for the airlines spill out into the walkway. Anytime a flight is about to take off, you are unable to pass through the area. Worth avoiding if possible.",-1,OAK

Extremely discourteous. There is no valid security reason to inconvenience someone this way when there is a garbage can right there.

I thought I would try Oakland instead of SFO because it seems like it would be more efficient since it’s 1/8 of the size of San Francisco’s airport. No wonder.

After clearing immigration at 5:15 there were no bags. It as 6pm before we exited the airport - 1:45 after landing! Someone wasn't doing their job. That delay for bags, on top of lack of gate capacity, is unacceptable service. This isn't a one off. Other family members had a similar experience on June 26 for the same flight where they waited 15 minutes for a gate again and weren't allowed to deplane for another 15 minutes due to a backup in the immigration hall. Departing OAK June 8 was another exercise in lack of airport capacity. Check-in took an hour. The gate had people sat on the floor everywhere due to lack of space for the size of the aircraft. OAK isn't equipped to handle the number and size if international flights currently using the airport. There are similar reviews from a year ago. Clearly Oakland Airport management don't care about customer service.",-1,OAK

It took less than half an hour to deplane, go through passport control and collect bags. Being a Club World passenger undoubtedly helped but even so we were pretty impressed. There was almost no queue to go through security at the time of departure (lunchtime midweek), so the process was painless. Again we were lucky that it was so quiet. A new business lounge has just opened by Gate 8. It's rather small, but has good food choice. Getting to San Francisco is a cinch using the BART connector shuttle to Coliseum and thence onwards to downtown San Francisco. In fact the whole experience is much better than at SFO. And because of the competition between BA and Norwegian fares from the UK are very reasonable at present.",1,OAK

Today, however, they've changed their queuing and the wait times are 30 minutes plus despite only about 100 people in line. Miultiple agents checking IDS at A-List queue with no one in line.

We were asked to remain in the airplane for an additional 45 mins due after landing to the delays in immigration. When we were finally allowed to deplane we then had an additional hour wait in the queue at immigration. Immigration itself does not make sense, one waits in line to go through the process at the machine and then waits another hour to have an individual stamp the passport. There were 3 officers tending to US citizens and another 3 to tend to non US passports. They need to employ more immigration officials! Oakland is trying to become another hub for SF, but cannot seem to get it right. We landed at 4.15 and received baggage at 6.30! An inefficient process to say the least.",-1,OAK

Typically, there are 2-5 immigration officers trying to get through a dreamliner with 200+ passengers. Twice, I had to wait 30 mins+ on the airplane, because another plane landed ahead of us, and immigration wanted to process them first. 2-3 hour waits are not unheard of.

Sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac upon arrival and then was delayed 3.5 hours on departure. Once we boarded, we had to wait another 45 minutes for someone to put gas in our plane. Baggage claim was a hot mess. Multiple passengers getting only some of their bags. We needed to wait for two other planes to unload their luggage before getting our second bag. Hundreds of people waiting for flights that disappeared from flight boards. Lines of customers waiting to speak to service agents that came and left the area without explanation or serviced people outside of the established lines.

When we first came, the airport was wide open, no real gates, no real baggage claim. Now, there are buildings but it is unwieldy. As an example, the United counter is at the far right end of the terminal, TSA is then 2/3 of the way to the left. Your first very long walk. No pre-check. Very limited food options when you finish with the TSA. Then what seems like a one mile walk to Gate 1 or 1 mile the other way to gate 39. Very few moving sidewalks especially in the lower gate numbers. OGG really needs updating and a better design. Less walking. More food. Better security checkpoint.

I was told by one staffer that bottled water has never been allowed on planes since the beginning of time, which is a lie.

One agent interrogating a 3yr old and 5 yr old as to their birthdates, their siblings birthdates, their parents birthdates, where their parents worked, etc. Have they never met a child that age? Kids were scared to death to answer and the agents were very rough and separated kids from the parents. They did this to at least 4 families I witnessed. Disorganized, slow, unnecessarily aggressive, and despite having at least 3 screening machines, only ran one. I hear the residents are mad so many tourists are coming to the island at this time as it’s a burden on all their water and food supply. Keep treating visitors like this and you won’t have to worry about it. The rest of the world will open up and, like me, we will go elsewhere and Maui can figure out another income industry.",-1,OGG

People eating with masks off everywhere in waiting area. Another man was coughing everywhere with no mask on and no one enforced any rules. No wonder Maui's cases have been going up. I understand the laid back vibe of Hawaii, but there are times when things need to be tightened up so you don't end up killing others with a virus. This was worst case scenario for me.

This time, I was with my young daughter. The counter attendants literally walked away as we were checking in and didn’t come back! Then the machine printing baggage tags malfunctioned and since they had left, there was no one to help us. Finally the guy directing our places in line felt bad for us and asked one of the other attendants to help, and she made a really big deal about coming to the other side of the counter to help us! At the gate—no stores. I had bad heartburn at this point so I wandered back to shop for an antacid or something and left my daughter with our stuff at the gate. No luck, only jewelry, souvenirs and a restaurant, so I approached a security guard to ask—and lo and behold I crossed the “magic line” (that’s what he said!) and was out of the security zone. Many tears ensued as my petrified daughter had to find me and schlep all our stuff along to give me my boarding pass so I could go back through the TSA screening and then they forgot to tell her I needed my ID so we went through it all again, now we are getting really close to being late for our plane and my poor daughter is alone up there as I frantically try to get back to her (of course no one could help me get through the now-huge line any faster to get back to her).

TSA agents shout at passengers continually, they are so verbally abusive to all. They pull your bagage apart in a rough manner and shove things back in in a very messy way. Nowhere to sit to tie your laces after taking your shoes off. No Nexus line. No smile from anyone and certainly no please or thank you.You wouldn't know you're in a US airport.

When we got a cab the driver told us that due to some reasons no one wants to come to the Airport so there are very little cabs available.

The time wasted meant we go without washroom breaks and any shopping, else we miss our flight. We arrived at gate B14 and departed at C11, a very long walk. Also need to point out, for some reason the man doing the security checks in our cue was extremely slow at his job, we could hear other passengers also saying “why is this man so slow at his job”.

Our flight itinerary included a connection to final flight home (Orlando) through O'Hare. The entire experience was a complete cluster with no clear direction or informative staff. The process for visitors to exit the customs area from international arrivals was embarrassingly long and lacking in clear directions. I was chatting up a baggage handler to get some logistical direction for how to proceed from the customs verification area. The long, long line of people trying to get out of terminal 5 and make their way toward connecting flight terminals or even to exit airport was appalling. There should have been multilingual employees serving as ambassadors to assist passengers who did not speak English well or at all. We had to pick up our luggage and literally re-check it AND go through security protocol all over again as if we had just walked in off the street to begin our journey. We had to interrupt airport staff from personal conversations to ask for direction! We had to ask several times from more than one person who we assumed worked for the airport, which way to get to our terminal (had to move from terminal 5 to 1 to catch connecting flight), which way to TSA pre-check for security, and which line to get in when there appeared to be redundant, contradicting signs.

I would say the biggest issue is spread out layout, and need to travel really far to get to one place and then another.

When we arrived we were surprised that the queues weren’t as long as we had feared and the man who checked our passports were nice enough. Going through security a woman kept screaming “Step up! Step up!” so we avoided her at all costs. The personnel just kept sighing and seemed really annoyed to have to deal with passengers. On our return flight they were even worse. I wasn’t allowed to accompany my daughter as I had the previous time. She has social anxiety so that wasn’t very pleasant for her. The staff just kept screaming at people what to do and were super rude. I get that this is their job and they do this every day, but most people don’t fly every day and being nicer shouldn’t be that hard. When we had gone through security and arrived at the international terminal we went to buy some water and sandwiches at a self checkout and some guy asked us if we needed a bag. When I said no he said in a super angry tone that he still had to see that my payment went through. I guess we looked like criminals? I went to the bathroom and got looked in. Finally managed to get out. Same thing happened to my daughter later in the day. We had an 11 hour layover and all the seats were really uncomfortable. I hurt all over when we finally got in our plane. (That the guy in front of me had his seat fully reclined the whole 8+ hour flight is another story) We were in Arizona for 10 days and didn’t meet a single rude person in all that time and the personnel at Phoenix Harbor were very pleasant.

TSA thinks they can treat you poorly simply because of their plastic badge. There are literally signs every 5 feet in the security line telling you that you have to remove anything larger than a cell phone from your bag. When I was attempting to remove my tablet, the TSA employee just kept saying over & over & over...(looking right at me) ""everything stays in your bag"". I politely asked why the sign indicated otherwise, and he just stared at me and said ""everything stays in your bag"". He wouldn't admit the sign states differently. After I finally passed through the metal detector, I got yelled at from another person, who takes her plastic badge very seriously, because I didn't put my bin away. TSA security was nothing but 20 minutes of being yelled at, being told we weren't making straight enough lines, moving too fast, moving too slow & getting ridiculed. They all roll their eyes & look at each other & snicker when someone doesn't do exactly what they think they should be doing. They really need to fix their system instead of getting mad when we can't understand why there are outdated signs. When we got to our gate, the woman working had zero patience for simple questions. We will use Milwaukee next time. Or any other airport not associated with Chicago where everyone hates their job! Just the worst airport. Perhaps they need to understand that a majority of the population doesn't fly on a regular basis. A little compassion & patience can go a long way. It must be exhausting being a TSA employee at O'Hare and being a miserable person every second of every day. I didn't want to give a 1 rating. I wanted to give a zero, but that wasn't an option.

2023-06-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,staff are seriously rude and unprofessional,True," Avoid this airport like the plague if you have a short layover and you want to make it in time for your flight. The lines move slower than a snail and some of the staff are seriously rude and unprofessional. For an airport of this size, it is so poorly organized that newcomers will have to go on a scavenger hunt to find their gate, if it's not already very close by. If your gate is in a different terminal, good luck actually finding it without stopping to ask for directions. I had about twenty minutes to get to my gate before the doors would close, but my flight wasn't listed on any of the departure screens in Terminal 1, so I had to hear it from a staff member that my gate number would be on a departure screen in Terminal 3. Which meant ten minutes wasted traveling by train all the way to Terminal 3, only to find out that the gate itself is actually located in Terminal 2. The icing on the cake was that my gate was E5, but there were literally no signs at all in Terminal 3 that gave any sort of hint as to where the E gates were. Which makes absolutely no sense, since that was where they sent me to find my gate. I had to hear it from a staff member that I was in the wrong terminal, but not before asking at least four different people and getting no answer at all. The security lady decided to give me attitude when all I asked was how to find the E gates from Terminal 3. She told me that I needed to get through security first, which again, makes absolutely no sense at all and is basically no answer. So to sum it all up, this is one of the worst airports ever if you are in a hurry or you have a connecting flight. You will find here slow moving lines, unhelpful and rude staff, and no way to get to the correct gate without having to go on a scavenger hunt, which most people don't have time to do.",-1,ORD

I also think the cell phones should be put away when working as it does not make anyplace look like the employees are needed when they walk around on the cell.

Why can they not figure out to put returning citizens and other visas into separate lines? This is an absolute joke. Arriving in other countries is easier than going home.

2022-10-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Absolutely horrible experience,True," I arrived in Chicago O'Hare at 6:18 pm and had to make a connecting flight which required me to recheck my bag. My connecting flight wasn't until 9:10 PM. I designed this so that I would have plenty of time to go through customs, recheck my bag, and eat dinner before my next flight. That might be true at most airports but not at O'Hare! The customs line was inefficient and took way too long. I think O'Hare needs to look at how other airports (such as Atlanta) manage customs lines. They have a lot to learn. Once through the line, everyone was callous, rude, and unhelpful. I was moved back a significant number of spaces (Maybe 10?) in the baggage recheck line, simply because one of the workers changed the queue line while I was in it so that others could go ahead. Then I had to go back through airport security, which is apparently always a disaster in the evenings at O'Hare. Not a separate security line, but the same security line someone who has just checked into their flight for the first time has to go through. The line wasn't moving, the workers were extremely rude, and I had olive oil I purchased in Croatia confiscated because it was ""suspicious"" even though it was in the proper marked bag for customs. Not to mention, the worker took an extraordinarily long time to check the marked bags, and cut them open. I missed my flight (even though I had a 3 hour cushion), never got dinner because all restaurants closed, and had to sleep in the airport overnight or risk having the rest of my items confiscated since she cut the customs bag open.

Our flight from Paris arrived late to ORD and we were in a panic to get to our connection to Atl. The long walk to customs was ridiculous! We asked a person about MPC and she pointed us to the ridiculous line which took almost an hour to get through, with only one person “helping” travelers. When we finally got to the customs agent he said we could have gone to a shorter line. So basically we were given bad info from the one worker facilitating the line. Then, we had to collect our bags, but none of the carousel signage had our flight on it. Again no one was around for help, but when I finally saw someone she was very rude and no help at all. After we finally found our luggage, we had to try and find info on how to get to Delta. No signs! Someone at AA told us we had to go back out to take the train to the designated terminal. And then check bags and go through security again. What a complete joke of an airport that is a prime example of a nightmare. Needless to say we missed our connection. We did get another flight so we went to the tiny Sky Lounge in 2E. The bathrooms were dirty, the ladies room had a broken soap container, and TP all over the floor. Avoid connecting through this airport at all costs. Or allow at least 4 hours if coming from an international flight. It’s too bad the airlines don’t plan for longer connection times.",-1,ORD

I arrived from Spain and had a connecting to LAX with just over two hours between. The instructions for navigation between customs, immigration/baggage, recheck baggage, security, transition between terminals and gate location were nearly non-existent and posted directions offered no meaningful help. Asking for help was equally non-productive as most airport staff seemed uncaring, unhelpful, distracted and most aggravating, poorly trained. I approached one ""information desk"" to inquire as to how to get from the arrival terminal to Terminal 3 - with my bags. The instructions were basically ""go outside, turn left and go upstairs."" I had left Santiago de Compostelo, Spain nearly 18 hours previous, I am 70 years old and have Addisons's disease. I replied, that I just didn't believe that physically I was able to make it. The young man simply turned away, not to help someone else, simply turned his back. I was finally able to get assistance by tagging along with someone in a wheel chair who had an airport attendant. My flight boarded late apparently due to airport congestion preventing the plane from approaching the gate. Repeatedly having the boarding/departure times changed resulted in virtually all passengers standing for more than 45 minutes. There are no ""queue"" lines and passengers just grouped - congesting the walk ways. I might have been able to put up with all of the incompetence were it not for the ""canned"" voice of the mayor of Chicago (I assume it's an election year) coming on the PA system more often than the meaningful and necessary announcements to brag on O'Hare as an excellent, award winning airport.

I explained I wasn’t changing my order, I simply wanted to have what I had ordered in the first place. I was then told I had to have ice in my drink as it was allegedly ‘airport policy’.

I wouldn't know the airport it once was, because I'm 33 and it's been on a downhill trend for my entire life. Yes they're trying to make improvements and I've even heard rumors of a major terminal construction project, but the airport doesn't feel like it belongs in the first world. TSA staff are rude, the terminal (5) is crowded, the seating is falling apart. As I write this I moved seats three times to find one that wasn't dirty or broken (Gate M20, TAP Airlines). They recently re did the train between terminals but it took a ridiculous number of years to complete, and terminal transfer was hell for that entire time. Chicago deserves a much better airport than O'hare. I would recommend flying through Milwaukee if at all possible, or if your traveling internationally, arrive in NY, Houston, ATL etc and connect to your final destination.",-1,ORD

Thankfully I had a reasonable transfer time as the airport experience was a total hideous ordeal and frankly an embarrassment to the operators. Signage is useless, the transit train was rammed - with the door inexplicably opening and closing without reason, but the worst part was the ridiculous security queue. There seems to be no priority queue for those holding a premium cabin ticket, but the guy who was ‘directing’ the queue should be removed with immediate effect. There is signage in the cattle pens that indicates the requirement to be polite and courteous to TSA staff, but that deal should work both ways. The big guy who was on duty in T5 on Sep 9th was shouting at passengers like animals. He was rude and quite frankly a bully.

All I can say is what a joke of an airport. If you can’t handle the volume of traffic coming through then they shouldn’t be allowed to sell tickets with transfers. Either that or sort out the infrastructure and staff. Let ticketed transfers in to another queue or utilise what you have and actually man the desks! Looking at other reviews this isn’t a one off.

This led us down a 2 hour excruciatingly tiresome long line that probably spanned the entire length of the airport to the Customs & Immigration counter. There were tired little kids fussing, including my daughter who got sick on the airplane. There was couple who had a connecting flight & they politely asked one of employees monitoring the flow of passengers if they can skip ahead as their connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes, they were allowed to skip further up but I don't know if they made their connecting flight & they were still 5 people ahead of them. The Immigration officers take their reviewing documents while masses of hungry & tired passengers are waiting in long lines. After we finally made it through customs, we couldn't figure out where the baggage claim for our airline was since the TV screens were showing only most recently arrived flights & not the ones that arrived 2 hrs ago. The employees were not helpful, so we looked around for other passengers from our flight & followed them. We found 2 of 3 luggages rather quickly but there no carts to be found. Many passengers including us ran around looking for carts & after 20 minutes we finally found one, we still needed to follow another line to handover the Immigration declaration card at the exit, thankfully this took only 20 minutes. They need to do a better job of making more groups or categories at the Immigration lines to speed up the process for people who have connecting flights, people traveling with young children etc. They need more officers to speed up this process. It's atrocious! Even when we left for Dubai couple of weeks ago the security check in took almost 2 hours.

He wasn’t checking anything. Once through that mess, it was not clear how to get to the trains- very poor signage. For a major international airport it was a disappointing experience that could easily be fixed with a little more organization and a few signs.

Connecting to an international flight requires taking the inter terminal train to Terminal 5. Despite it being a very warm day (90 degree temperatures), the AC was not effective. Train carriages were rather warm. Terminal 5 needs a major renovation. Upon disembarking from the train, there was one long narrow line to go through TSA once again. Passengers who arrive on connecting domestic flights shouldn't have to go through TSA twice. The concourses are very crowded and the lighting could be better. There are signs posted re terminal renovation/expansion which is desperately needed.",1,ORD
2022-05-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,It was definitely survival of the fittest,False,"  We just returned from a long delayed trip to Scandinavia and Great Britain. I wonderful trip - including attending a family wedding. Unfortunately, we returned via O’Hare with a connecting flight to our hometown in Wisconsin. Our SAS flight from Copenhagen was great - we arrived on time. Once we were arrived at the International terminal - a whole different story. Long lines for passport check - which was fine - we had a 3 hour layover for our flight home. You were geared through the line - yelled at by what seemed like over worked employees to move here, move there, etc. Got through with a passport stamp and a stamp on our customs declaration card and thought ok - not too bad. Next - loud announcements ordering us to get our checked luggage (which had been checked through to our final destination) before going through customs. We found the baggage carousel with people packed around - and had an anxious two hour wait for our bags to arrive. All the while - customs agents walked around with dogs sniffing hand luggage for illegal contraband like an orange or an apple. I like dogs - so this was okay. During that two hour wait - many of our fellow passengers were in despair that they had missed their flights. Once we got our bags - we went through another line with our bags past a single agent who took our stamped customs card. That was the customs check. We then had to find the American desk (no signs) and recheck our bags. They agent there said just leave your bags there and run / you have an hour to your flight. We ran to the train to get to our terminal. We then had to go back through security - where there was a line. When waiting in line - someone told us to go to number 7 instead. We ran in the direction he was pointing - as no idea what no. 7 meant. Got to another security line - made it through. Got to our gate just in time. Flight delayed a little so finally able to use rest room. Got on the plane - sat on the tarmac for two hours due to backed up traffic. Then storms hit - flight cancelled. The American Airlines crew was apologetic. Off the plane - in long line that did not move to get rescheduled. Gave up - no flights for at least 24 hours. No help from American couldn’t even get close to the front of the line after waiting an hour. No help therefore with food (managed to buy two donuts before they closed) - no help with hotel. Nothing available nearby online. Missed the last bus home. Spent about 2 hours finding our luggage- went to three different luggage carousels. At that point we were operating on rumors from other passengers on where luggage might be. At about 1:30 in the morning after being up for about 24 hours - we booked seats on a bus for 7 in the morning and spent the night in a noisy, freezing cold, uncomfortable airport. No food available obviously. I had some chocolate in my bag that the dogs didn’t care about in customs. That and the two donuts we managed to buy. It was definitely survival of the fittest - were old (60’s and 70’s) but in good shape. We made it home after being up for about 35 hours. We were amazed by our welcome to the US.",-1,ORD

By the time I got to the counter to check my bag the clerk smiled and said you are 6 minutes too late to catch my flight which wasn’t leaving for 35 minutes. She said I can reschedule you for a flight leaving tomorrow at 3.30 and provide you a discount for a hotel. I lost it after being up for over 24 hours and encountering so many rude workers at that airport. A manger heard me even though I didn’t raise my voice and offered to help. He was able to reschedule me on a flight to Green Bay which was to leave at 7.30. That flight was delayed until 10.30, no reason provided. We didn’t arrive in Green Bay until 11.30, and didn’t arrive home until 12.30. This horrible experience has ended any future travels.

Very sketchy taxi drivers are stationed outside the lower level.

Instead of helping us along the extensive additional requirements that Covid has brought upon us, employees were incredibly rude. In fact, the final pass through was with a lady that screamed at everyone to stay in line and get their papers ready. I was shocked, and actually already had the paper she was screaming about in my hand. She acted as if we weren’t allowed to travel and shouldn’t be there. Well...here’s reality, I am a single mom with two kids in college, so when my company asks me to travel I do it. I am respectful, had my mask on and bags already in hand and also had the paper she was yelling at us about ready to show her. It was just shameful behavior by staff in terminal 5 at ORD.

I was arriving on United and departing on Turkish, so I arrived at one extreme end of the airport and then had to exit security and take a bus for a long time to get to Terminal 5, then go through security again. Terminal 5 is a weak point of the airport, though it looks like there is a train going in (still outside security). In January 2021 half the lounges are closed and my airline hasn't bothered to make an arrangement with the ones that are open, though that is not exactly the airport's fault. In my past experience, the lounges here are lame compared with those in the United areas, which I could not use since there is no way to get through without leaving security. ORD should organize the Star Alliance carriers to depart from the terminals United uses since international connections are common, it would save all kinds of difficulty for travelers. Terminal 5 may as well be a different airport since you have to allow at least half an hour to get there and leave security, you could make it to Midway airport in not much more time.",1,ORD

Finally a nice woman arrived, stopped to let me get water and took me all the way on the ramp into the plane. She was kind to me and very apologetic, the only person that was. There was no wi-fi and the place is filthy. I do not think a nonstop flight was worth the nightmare I endured with rude indifferent employees. On that note they could learn from the considerate employees and the cleanliness of the South Carolina airport. Upon returning today, Dec 3, yet another rude employee when I got off the plane she was there with a wheelchair but couldn't sit in it due to other passengers waiting for luggage.

People were packed into the large room waiting for others to wander around looking for an available kiosk to scan their passport. So unorganized. How about putting the kiosks in a row for people to use while in line? Once finished, we had to stand in long lines again waiting to get checked through. There were only 7 windows open for hundreds of people to funnel through. And, not to sound like ""that guy"", but they were speeding the non-citizens through a lot faster. 2 were for working visas and students, 5 for citizens and tourists. They should be putting the tourists with the non-citizens. They should also have a line for connecting flights because this is the second time we almost missed our flight due to this mess and we weren't the only ones stressing over a connecting flight. Once we eventually got through, getting our bags was pretty quick and easy, but after that, there were no signs saying where to go next. We just got in the super long line with everyone else. My wife went ahead to talk to someone to make sure we were in the correct place. That person told her that we needed to go outside the huge room to a different place so she ran back and got my son and I and we did as he said. Once we got out and the doors closed behind us, we found out that we were in the right place before and now we had to wait for someone else to come out so we could go back in. We went to to counter to talk to them again and they said to just leave our bags there and go to our flight and they would scan them in for us. I didn't feel comfortable about just leaving our bags next to the counter while they were checking in other people who were waiting in line, but we had no choice. Our flight had started boarding and we were nowhere near the terminal. We missed using the family lane for going through security twice because the lane was roped off. Someone who works there saw us and opened it and they were genuinely surprised that he had to tell us to use it. In all the chaos, we lost one of our boarding passes, so we had to rush to the ticket counter to get a new one printed. She insisted on reprinting all 3 passes even though we only needed 1. After that was done, we started to run to the next step when my wife checked and saw they printed the wrong name on my boarding pass. We decided to just use the old one since it didn't need to be reprinted anyway. It was like she was deliberately wasting our time when we had none to waste. We ran to the tent outside (by the way, we weren't dressed for cold weather because we had no plans to leave the airport so my 7-year-old was freezing right along with us) where we were told to wait for the bus. There were so many people that we had to wait for the next one. We knew we had to go to terminal 1, but when the driver stopped, he never said anything. He just opened the door. Now, I could assume that the first stop is terminal 1, but I hate to make assumptions and get off the bus at the wrong terminal when we're already pressed for time.Luckily, someone else said they could see a ""1"" outside, so we got off and ran. We made it to our flight while they were almost finished boarding. 2 hours should have been enough time to get through, but it almost wasn't. Complete chaos, inefficiency and lack of knowledge at O'Hare. Can't rate some things because we had no time to use them.",-1,ORD

In 2019, the experience was a real mixed bag, first things first, most people I met working at the airport could not have been friendlier or more helpful. A true positive. Even the TSA personnel and incredibly overworked gate agents were patient yet efficient, though, I know this isn't always the case, as with the overworked yet strangely entitled and lackadaisical barista at Starbucks. Oh well, there always seems to have be at least ""that one"" in airports. However, while I've never had particularly negative experiences, this airport is still not easy to like or embrace. It's clearly outdated, outmoded, and overused, if you've ever watched ""Home Alone,"" which came out in 1990, I'm pretty sure the airport looks today just as it did in 1990 (and even earlier). The airport is dirty all the way around and not well taken care of, even smelling what I can describe as dank and damp in certain areas. Gate seating is not ample. While there are plenty of dining and shopping options both pre- and post-security, many of those options have a sort of dingy feel, no matter how well run they are and how friendly the staff are. The lighting and flooring suck, and even the sporadic display of attractive, futuristic-by-1980s-standards artwork doesn't change that fact. Even though the area of Chicago in which O'Hare is located is generally nice and middle-class, the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) train station below the terminal has a strangely uncomfortable feeling - and the station and CTA trains are just filthy, even though the station is less than 30 years old (that's CTA's fault, though). Back upstairs, ride shares take longer to arrive and drop off than at many other large airports, even when things aren't particularly crowded. In all, O'Hare provides a poor introduction to, and representation of, an otherwise friendly, vibrant and unique city called Chicago. What a shame.",-1,ORD

When I went to get my things from the conveyer belt, the woman who was handling the baskets with the basket cart was coming through and I must’ve been in her way and couldn’t move quick enough. She screamed ""excuse me!"" (Every single person in that line looked at her with wide eyes because of how obnoxiously loud it was) with a huge attitude. So I moved out of the way and I said ""oh, I am sorry ma’am"". She walked on by ignoring me and then rolling her eyes and laughing with the other TSA woman doing the pat downs. I’m sorry, but I should’ve never been treated that way and this was one of the most unpleasant experiences I have ever been through in an airport.

I had to wait an excessively long time for my bag (had to check it at the gate before leaving my original destination). And then I had to sprint to my connection only to be told boarding closed literally seconds before I got there. The worker surprisingly wasn’t too rude about it, but I was still angry that they couldn’t hold the flight for 2 minutes for myself and 3 other passengers from my original flight.

There were multiple flight delays, and they changed the departure gate three times, with the last change forcing all passengers to go from the C terminal to the B terminal. In the end, the flight to Houston departed at about 10 pm, a delay of 6 hours, and for me a total of 9 hours spent in O'Hare, not knowing when, or if, there would be a flight to Houston that day. There was almost no place to sit, so most of the passengers were forced to stand for hours. This airport is poorly designed, managed horribly, and it does not have enough gates.

This brings you to terminal 1, where exhausted and hungry travellers are met with only fast food options with food courts, no sit down restaurants with a full kitchen.

Unfortunately, I live near Chicago, so I must fly in and out of O'Hare's international terminal (Terminal 5) regularly. I have three complaints: One, I'm used to airport food concessions being rip offs, but at least elsewhere there are relatively low-priced options. But not O'Hare's Terminal 5. No fast food outlets anywhere - only expensive restaurants. Last time I was there I had two hours to kill and was hungry, and I ended up paying $20 for a cheeseburger and a bottle of water. Two, other airports have decent bookstores. Schipol in Amsterdam comes to mind. But not Terminal 5. I guess in our dumb country people don't read books.

The degree of disorganization, coupled with the overall sprawl of the airport, makes for a bad experience. The bussing of passengers between the international and domestic terminals resembles something analogous to cattle being herded into a milking contest at the local county fair, the signage indicating what to do and where to go is very minimal and confusing. Between the bare-bones number of TSA screeners on shift and being selected for additional screening/pat down, I missed my connecting flight by two minutes. The airport workers made it very clear through their half-mumbled non-responses that they did not give even care about trying to help me identify who I should speak to regarding the situation.

The people who were supposed to be helping were pushy and short as if we were inconveniencing them and not the other way around and several people missed their flights because of their mess. Tsa workers were continually shuffling which security areas were open which made the wait longer (a couple who arrived 30 minutes before me made it to the same gate at the same time because they had gates closed just as they were about to enter security twice).

The attendant that is supposed to check if flyers are “pre-checked” or not should actually do their job.

Some people are first time flyers. Be patient, be helpful, do your job. help educate them so next time things can go smoother. Next — allow families/groups to stay together. When one attendant is pulling one-by-one from three different lines, the person or people I am traveling with could be very far behind me. This is not conducive with groups of minors. It can be scary and allowing them to stay together is a small courtesy that could be extended to help out. Teach your workers patience. It was terrible here.

Despite most people I know telling me that O’Hare is awful, I thought it was okay overall - in fact, I found them quite efficient. I arrived in a Chicago on a Thursday. Being Canadian, I was able to breeze past immigration through their automated clearance system, and got through in 10 minutes. The immigration officer had a serious expression, and waved me through really quickly. My bags arrived shortly after I reached he reclaim area. Seeing as my flight arrived 2 hours early, I tried to get switched to the earlier flight, and after the United ground staff dealt dealt with the frustratingly lengthy process of rebooking my flight, she was able to land me a seat on the flight and helped me ensure that my bag would be checked in to that flight despite there only being a one hour window to departure. This also meant that I needed to rush to Terminal 1 from the international terminal. Rushing to Terminal 1 is normally easy, seeing as they have that automated people mover, but it’s undergoing long-term maintenance/being rebuilt in sections, so it’s closed on weekdays. This meant that I was at the mercy of the shuttle bus, which was obviously slower to board and arrive, due to the very peculiar traffic design between terminals. There was this one intersection that allowed one bus through at a time and took close to 10 minutes to clear. Despite all that rushing, I was still able to get to my flight in time, partly due to their speedy TSA crew that in dealing with the backlog decided that’s passengers could go through with their shoes on. My flight back from Minneapolis occurred without a hitch, though arriving with a 3 hour layover gave me a chance to really soak up the architecture and movie filming locations in the 3 main terminals. I probably could’ve also tried their dining, but alas, I have not. When it comes to waiting for flights, the seats at Terminal 1 are old, but adequate. I appreciate their provision of outlets near seating for device charging, but it would probably be even better if they also provided USB ports on the outlets, and fitted universal outlets seeing as travellers may not have the correct adaptors. Also, Boingo is still the main WiFi provider in the airport, but they now offer a few hours of unlimited wifi every time you watch an ad. The ads aren’t that long, so I’d argue that that’s okay, and for cost recovery, it’s not too annoying.",1,ORD

2018-09-22,0.3,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,a horrible experience,False," I had a horrible experience at Chicago O'Hare recently. On September 3rd, we had an international layover on our way to Italy for our honeymoon. There were some weather issues which caused our incoming flight from Seattle to circle the airport for a while before we were finally able to land. No problem, I get weather issues. Once we were able to deboard the plane, we had to find the international terminal. The airport had very poor signage for this, so we stopped to ask a staff. He told us the quickest way would be to go to the end of the G gates and take a shuttle to the M International terminal to avoid having to exit the airport and go through security again. Once we got to G17 where the shuttle was, a female airport worker told us she needed to see our boarding passes and passports. We handed them over and she said she couldn't allow us to be shuttled until she confirmed our flight was still there. I told her that my Delta app confirmed that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. I had also heard an announcement that all flights were delayed from the weather since no planes were able to take off or land. She insisted on checking Google Flights for her update as well as got on her walkie-talkie to ask someone who was in the international wing if our flight was still there. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and we need to board our plane. This person who works at the damn airport would not use the airport computer to check our flight status and continued to rely on Google Flights. She told us that she would not shuttle us over because apparently our flight had left. I told her she was wrong and she refused. I was furious. I grabbed our passports and told my husband, ""I don't trust that she is right. I think we still need to make a run for it and go to the international wing by ourselves."" We exited the airport, caught the rail train and went through security with 10 minutes to spare. We finally made it to our gate and what do you know, our flight was still there! We were able to board and had about 5 minutes.",-1,ORD
2018-09-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,Avoid this airport,True," Avoid this airport if at all possible. Horrendous experience both arriving and departing. When we arrived it took over half an hour to get off the plane because information on connecting flights had be posted just outside the exit and caused congestion. We then made our way down to immigration control which was in chaos. There were no proper signs just some people shouting instructions which nobody could understand. We followed people and ended up in the wrong place. After 10 minutes we were then told where we needed to go by somebody we could understand. This was the longest queue I have ever seen, It took us 15 minutes to get to the back of it. When we got near the automatic machines we were stopped for about 15 minutes because the queue after the machines was too long and was clogging up the machine area. When we used the machines our documents were rejected. We later found out that the machines were rejecting 95% of people. This was the basis of the queue. Because of this we had to go in the next queue to be dealt with manually. Altogether it took nearly 3 hours to get through the immigration. Departing was not much better. After checking in, which took about 40 minutes because BA do not have a bag drop option and only 2 desks open for Economy and Premium Economy passengers we were then faced with another huge queue for immigration. It was so long it spilled out onto the check in area. Once through immigration the security check was relatively quick although I had to be body searched because I left a plastic comb in my pocket! It took over 2 hours to get through. One of our worst experiences at a USA airport, although departing from here was also bad a couple of years ago, so a place to avoid.",-1,ORD

One airline had two flights leaving within an hour but was assigned a limited number of check-in counters. This caused the line to spill in to the hallway and blocking foot traffic. Once you clear check-in, the immigration and final security is done in a small area where there is not much of a system. Lines can crisscross and you really need to be patient as you go through the process. I had a red eye flight and I wanted to get a meal before boarding. Unfortunately most restaurants were closed by 9pm. As expected the one open restaurant was swamped with customers. The restaurant staff could hardly cope with orders taking a long time coming.

2018-08-25,0.7,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,"an abundance of restaurant choices""
",True," I feel like O'Hare gets a bad wrap overall for a few reasons, but some issues are legitimate, and the experience will vary greatly depending on which terminal you go through. For starters I usually fly United, and usually go through Terminal 1 or 2. I don't fly through Terminal 3, and my experience in the International Terminal has only been for one arrival recently. That said, I can break down Terminal's 1 and 2 which are good overall in my view. For starters the main issue with United is connecting flights can take a little while to get around. Terminal 1 is separated into two concourses connected by an underground walkway. In theory you could have a connecting flight on United Express which are mostly located in Terminal 2 despite your regular United flight may land at the C-Gates in Terminal 1. Therefore, you may have to walk from the end of the C-gate to the central area to reach the underground tunnel, go underground the tarmac, pop up at Terminal 1, then go to the end to reach the walkway to Terminal 2, then you'll cross into Terminal 2, and finally you are at your gate. It sounds like a long walk because it is. I recommend at least have 30 minutes to transfer flights. Then the other issues at O'Hare can be queue times for TSA, or some restaurants. I can say from personal experience the TSA at O'Hare have been relatively quick, as in no more than 20 minutes to get through during most times, however, during some peak times such as 4-6 pm, then lines can get long and take over 30 minutes. It has been random since sometimes during ""peak times"" things have been quick. I finally got TSA pre-check, so I'll see how that goes when I fly out tomorrow. Finally the last big issue is the poor wifi. It's Boingo which is too expensive, and at times it doesn't process your purchase correctly. Try to get into a United Club for wifi. I have gone through some personal negatives, and likely negatives for flyers in Terminals 1 and 2. The good news there are pluses. For one, the food choices are good. There are some local chains including Rick Bayless own chain which has solid Tex-Mex sandwiches, and amazing Guacamole. I believe Wow Bao is located in O'Hare, and there is a local tea chain as well. Meanwhile there is an abundance of restaurant choices such as steak, Italian, seafood, cafe food, etc. From my experience I haven't had a bad meal. Keep in mind, don't expect Michelin star restaurants, but if you have a good layover, then you can get a good meal. Finally the bar scene isn't bad, but prices are airport prices. At least Goose island has bars with local tapped beer. Finally the last positive is the location. The blue line connects to O'Hare, 24/7, to the Loop. It's near I-90 and I-294 which help drivers get around anywhere in the Chicagoland area. That said, if you are going to Northwest Indiana, or Joilet, then it'll take a good hour to get there from O'hare. That said, the taxi stand is outdated and slow. Expect to spend a good 30 minutes to get a taxi. Overall it is a good big airport. It's not perfect, nor the best in the world since I've been to LHR to Narita, however, as a large US airport it's one of the better ones in my view. Especially compared to EWR or elsewhere.",1,ORD

By 8:30pm nearly all the shops, bars and restaurants were closing or closed and we couldn't find nowhere serving food. The one Hudson shop open had queues snaking around the shop continually and was the only place available to get any kind of food. The services were completely inadequate for a large airport! If you can’t cater for passengers after 8pm - don’t have any flights from this time.",-1,ORD
2018-06-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,,an unnecessarily cumbersome system,True," My husband and I arrived at the International terminal with baggage having been checked in Great Britain. We were connecting to another US flight. We had to pick up our bags and then turn them in again (all we did was carry them over, no checks occurred along the way, why can't the airline handle this along with any additional checks of our luggage?) Then, we were guided onto buses that took us out of the security zone, requiring another time through security. Unfortunately, some duty-free liquor we had purchased after clearing security in Britain had not been sealed as required, and we were forced to check it for an additional $100 fee and we almost missed our connecting flight. If we had known about the additional security clearance, we would have made sure the liquor was sealed as required or bought it in time to put in checked baggage. But never in international arrivals elsewhere have we had to leave security just to keep our original bags checked. This seems an unnecessarily cumbersome system that needs to be fixed. Until it is, we will never again book an international arrival into O'Hare. You have lost our business. For the sake of others, please see that airlines warn people that they will have to enter security again at O'Hare, so they need to be careful about liquids they acquire after initial security clearance.",-1,ORD

I am a frequent traveler (bi-weekly flyer), and ORD was by far the worst organized airport I've ever experienced. From the food choices to the unorganized airlines to small terminal seat areas. Chicago O'Hare Airport is at the bottom of my list, and do not recommend this airport to anyone - experienced traveler or not. Doesn't seem like the airport staff care either. If they did, things would improve. It's extremely disappointing this is one of the Chicago airports. This has made my trip a very bad experience.",-1,ORD
2018-06-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,either rude or unhelpful,True,"  We had a connecting flight here between London and LAX. It was a horrible experience from beginning to end. Good thing our flight from London was an hour early because it took us 2.5 hours and we barely made our next flight. Every employee was either rude or unhelpful, and there were no visible signs to direct us. When we arrived we opted for Mobile Pass because they recommended it on our prior flight saying it would speed the process. The airport wasn't equipped for it and employees had no idea what we were talking about. We ended up in a long line for it after having a woman yelling at us for being in the wrong line. Several loud monitors blared Olympic-like music along with a weird ""American pride"" video which felt like something you'd see in North Korea. Picture this with a loud woman yelling the same thing over and over in the background and combine it with sleep-deprivation after a 9-hour flight. Welcome to America. There were multiple lines throughout the following process, from customs to another security checkpoint. All were very long with unhelpful rude employees. There were no visible signs telling us where to go. We ended up lost several times and nobody would help us except for a few volunteers in yellow shirts. We were then loaded up like cattle onto a bus just to get to terminal 1 after waiting in another long hot line. We then had to cut in line at security because the line looked like Disneyland and by then (2 hours later) our flight was already boarding. When I asked a TSA agent for help, he said he couldn't help me and that our only hope was to ""ask everyone in front of us if we could go ahead of them"", so we had no choice but to forge our way through hundreds of very angry people. We ran to our gate and barely made it for our next flight. We will avoid this airport next time.",-1,ORD

For this reason alone we were taken aside and spent 3 hrs waiting to be questioned by customs officers. After a long flight I sat on a hard bench with no food watching customs treating people like they were sub human. At one point two officers high fived after they had upset one lady! Our questioning consisted of whether we were trying to have a baby in the US (“no we are only here for 10 days for a wedding”) and then lots of questioning regarding why we weren’t trying to have a baby in the US (“because we have a house, jobs, family, the NHS and we are just on holiday!”). He couldn’t believe we had free healthcare in the UK (perhaps do some research). At no point did he ask us whether we had insurance or to see our return flights. Completely inadequate questioning! Rather than question pregnant women for hours perhaps you should look at changing your laws so that anyone who has a baby there doesn’t automatically qualify to be a resident (if what he told us is even accurate). I won’t be returning. Really poor reflection of Chicago which is a beautiful city.",-1,ORD

Although it is easy to find where you need to go for immigration, the line for customs is not marked at all and I ended up in a very long line when I could have been in a short global entry line. The staff are clueless, I asked two people who sent me to the wrong line. There’s also insufficient signage to explain where to go to recheck your bags. Many people stood in one long line only to find that there was no line at all at their connecting airline but the signage not indicate any other option.

",False,"  I am a born and raised Chicagoan that is extremely embarrassed at the poor operation for international arrivals at O'Hare. The airport staff are completely clueless and have no issue yelling at each other and at passengers (employees at passport control). They go out of their way to make the process more chaotic and difficult (customs). As an example, the line at customs to leave the baggage claim area was extremely long. Personnel waited until passengers went almost completely through the line before telling a few people ""there is no line at carousel 3"". If they had directed passengers to other available counters, the whole process would have been easier. The tram to other terminals and to access CTA was not available, but they had shuttle buses. Instead of having signage posted, they simply put ""Closed"" signs on the escalators heading up and had rude and unprofessional staff standing there. When asked how we were supposed to access the CTA, I was told ""it's not running."" What she really meant was that the tram was not running. At that point, I had already spent over 2 hours in the airport and was so tired of dealing with incompetence that I took a cab rather than deal with any other employees. Seriously, O'Hare. You need to get it together. So many people experience Chicago only through your airport, and you make us look hood. I didn't even mention the dirty bathrooms and old tattered looking furniture in many of the terminals.",-1,ORD

All other flights are not shown, not even in the display right in front of their boarding gate. We arrived at the airport several hours in advance, since we were traveling with young children. After passing security, we looked at the displays, saw that there was a single flight leaving for our destination and assumed that it would be ours, but it turned out that it was an AA flight leaving half an hour later than ours. We ended up losing our flight with Spirit, having to spend the night in a hotel and buy new tickets for the next morning with a different airline.

I've flown to this airport (to and from and mostly for connections) at least 30 times. Certainly smaller airports with no connecting flights are more comfortable because of the sheer volume of flights and customers. But I have to say that I have always found the gate personnel more than helpful each time I've needed them. Flights at O'Hare are typically delayed and take a long time but that's part of the business when you travel to a place with so many flights. When I have tried to board earlier flights or needed exceptions made, the gate personnel are always as accommodating as they can be. If you know what to ask for and ask politely you'll find typical Midwest hospitality at O'Hare.",1,ORD

We had to run to terminal 1, go through security again due to having to go on the bus because the airport shuttle was closed. Security had 2 staff working, TSA staff extremely rude, then we had to run to terminal 2, still did not make our flight and plane left without us. Shuttles and terminals should be open until all flights are in, especially connecting flights. All airport direction staff should be informed of closed terminals to accurately direct people to their next flight to prevent delays.

The whole flight was waiting and only one person checked where bags were saying they'll be coming soon. I had to phone my transfer up as soon as I was ready. Went to the information help desk to be dealt with by a rude and snotty girl. She was too busy wanting to eat and pick her orange instead of helping me. She told me I had to phone and speak to United Airlines. My transfer had nothing to do with United. All I wanted was to use the phone for 2 mins.

The terminals are always crowded but there are lots of seating, eating places, and shops. Signage is good. Restrooms look old though are kept reasonably clean given the high usage. I had connections and was able to spend the time usefully. The biggest drawback I felt was the long distances between terminal gates and in the absence of moving walkways, going from one gate to another is rather tiring.

2018-01-12,0.5,Business,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,find O'Hare to be busy and crowded,True," I fly weekly for business, and connect semi-regularly through Chicago O'Hare on American Airlines. American is all in Terminal 3, concourses G, H, K and L. It can be a hefty hike from a commuter flight at the end of G to a flight at the end of L, as it's pretty spread out. In general, I find O'Hare to be busy and crowded. The concourses are too narrow for the number of travelers, and the usual boarding-time gate-cluster can choke off the entire concourse. The restrooms are generally abysmal - tiny, crowded, questionably sanitary. It's not through any fault of the staff, I regularly see staff cleaning them but O'Hare's restrooms are generally 2 or 3 stall wonders, sprinkled here and there for millions of travelers. O'Hare's dining options, on the other hand, are great. My personal favorite is the Cubana Torta from Frontera Torta in Terminal 3 - it's life-altering. There is an ample selection of dining choices whether you want fast food, upscale dining, healthy salads or a Chicago pizza. Shopping is also similarly good - I generally only need drinks and snacks, but O'Hare has the largest Hudson News I've ever seen, in the common area between Terminals 1 and 2. There are a fair number of upscale stores throughout, though. Connecting through O'Hare, I always make sure I have more than an hour between flights. Two hours is better. I have been delayed many times, to some extent or another, on my arrivals into ORD. Sometimes it's a broken regional jet. Sometimes it's a weather delay. MANY times, though, it's a delay from ground operations, after we land - my personal record is spending 45 minutes taxiing and parking out on the tarmac due to ground traffic. I would count on spending an average of 20 minutes between landing and actually reaching your gate. I still use O'Hare. It's the only airport American serves from one of my local airports, and one of only a few from my other home base. Flight selection through O'Hare is generally good. It's just the actual experience that suffers, in my experience.",1,ORD

I know they handle thousands of people everyday and I understand that they must follow a lots of regulations, all for us travelers security, and I’m fine with that. But, why do they have to be so rude, unpolite and even humiliating? It feels like they treat us travellers as some kind of idiots and they can say and do whatever they want just because they can. This is not ok! Therefore I suggest that you give them an education in good behaviour. Unfortunately, I’m going to avoid O’Hare and chose other aiports as far as it’s possible.",-1,ORD

This time, flying on United, we were delayed three hours into the airport because of weather. We arrived at 10 pm to discover we missed our connecting, express, flight by 30 minutes. No other flights to any nearby cities were leaving that evening. We thought about renting a car and driving (4-5 hrs) home, but the costs were over $250 for those agencies willing to even let us take a vehicle one way. United rebooked us on a 7 am flight the next day, but would not offer hotel vouchers. By this time it was almost midnight. The service agent mentioned that ""somewhere"" in Terminal 2 cots might be available for the evening. We wandered around until we discovered probably 100 people already resting in cots in Terminal 2. Kudos to O'Hare for making these available, however, never throughout the night were the lights dimmed in the corridor, nor were the TVs turned down or the overhead announcements stopped. Additionally, the airport employees continued to walk by talking loudly, or driving various vehicles as if it were 11 am, not 3 am. It was like trying to sleep at a racetrack. And then they woke us all up at 4.30 so they could put away the cots! I am sure the city of Chicago would prefer that we all go get a hotel room, but an additional expense of $100 and up is often not in the family budget - not to mention the time involved to travel in and out of the airport. We would have all been much more impressed if customer service in the form of a quiet corner to sleep had been offered.",-1,ORD

Chicago O'Hare is a very efficiently operated airport. Flights were on time, service was good, and boarding was quick on all the gates I passed. I was using the International Terminal and I didn't have a chance to view the domestic wing of the airport, but I was impressed with the airport operations. The food near the international terminal is pretty good choice wise and the bathrooms near the terminal are clean. When asking for directions to a gate, or room, the cleaning staff and Customs Officers are very helpful. The flights from the terminal were all on time, except for one, which had a two hour delay coming from Brazil. From what I observed, the ground crew was working quickly, and getting the job done.

Most airports have some kiosk where information can be obtained, or staff who can help arriving passengers. There was nothing. I was arriving after many hours of travel from South Asia via Qatar. After the surly, scowling passport control officer slapped my passport onto the counter with a sort-of grunt (no ""Welcome home"" here!), and after a harrowing experience at the baggage free-for-all, I was given no direction how to get my baggage through customs and back onto my ongoing flight to Seattle. Most airports have this part down, but queries resulted in mocking statements like ""It's obvious, just follow the people over there."" The people ""over there"" were not going to American Airlines to get their already-checked-through baggage onto the next plane, or to hand over their customs declaration form (by the way, nobody took my form and I never found any customs officials). Every query I made of some official-looking person resulted in more ridicule and less information, as the hour of my departing flight grew nearer. When I said that I had a tight connection to make, officials said that was just too bad. Why go on and on? I must say that this was my worst airport experience in 38 years of travel all over the world-mainly because of the rudeness and angry, scowling personalities of airport staff. They did not want to be bothered with helping or giving information. I barely made my connection, and that only happened because one nice woman took an interest and told me how to get my checked-through baggage back onto the plane and that I needed to go to a different terminal by train to get to my departing flight. When I finally found it, I was screamed at by security officials. Wow, Chicago, overall rating is a zero for you! I somehow doubt that you care, though.",-1,ORD

The passport control officer was the rudest I’ve ever encountered, and I’ve traveled throughout the world, he had no eye contact, no speech, just pointed, with a scowl on his face and an attitude of pure hatred toward the people passing through. The personnel in the automated passport control, seeing people with clear need for assistance, ignored them, except to bark commands like “no cell phones” and it was unclear who they were talking to and what that really meant. I had just returned from Edinburgh where security was very careful but where people explained things clearly and were extremely polite. Apparently in Chicago expressing hostility is how you make things secure. Also last month I picked up my son there who flew in on Virgin America. Zero flight information posted for Virgin, zero.

What does it say here?"" (pointing at our passports cover, as if we were unable to understand). It says ""United Kingdom"", not ""United States"". We tried to reply that we actually live in the USA and we have visas that allow us to do so, but he wouldn't have it. ""Again (as if he were speaking to one year olds), what does it say here? ""United Kingdom"". You are not citizens"". He repeated this several times, without listening to us. Knowing that, unfortunately, he could potentially be spiteful and delay our entrance to the country indefinitely (and our dog is here, so at least we wanted him back!), I had to restrain myself and just reply: ""We are residents, we never said we are citizens. We live here and have done so for four years now"". Finally, the penny dropped. ""Ah, yes, there's a difference"". And that was all. No apology for treating us like children, for his smugness, rudeness, or his mocking attitude. I can understand he can make a mistake, but it's unforgivable that he should have that attitude without even having listened to us. He treated us like we were having a hard time understanding anything, when in fact it was him who was misunderstanding the situation (and not making any effort to get the facts before answering with his stupid arrogance).

The queuing systems seemed to work perfectly efficiently and the newly introduced one-stop-priciple for passengers travelling with handluggage only did a great job. In addition, the train service at this airport is great although there is no airside link between the terminals avialable. My general impression of terminals 5 and 1 was that they were very clean.

It was also strange that I had to pass through security control again since I had to move from a domestic terminal to the international terminal. The queues were indeed very long and time consuming. However, when passing through finally, it showed up to be efficient with modern scanners that accepted to just put the bag through without having to put out computer and liquids apart from the bag. That system is well recommended in all Airports so the security checks can be more efficient. The worst thing is that it was not so easy to navigate and it was so crowded. It was quite clean, but it could be a bit better. I can however recommend the Airport since they actually do their best in their situation anyway.",1,ORD

The Southwest check-in agent was very friendly, as were the TSA employees at the checkpoint. My bag got flagged as a possible explosive, but luckily they figured out it wasn't. A major plus ORF has to offer is its new bathrooms, which were installed less than a year ago. These are sleek, modern, and well-maintained by airport staff. The terminal itself reflects the era it was built in, with smaller windows and lower ceilings than, say, SEA. Instead of inducing claustrophobia, though, it gives the entire a building a more ""cozy"" feeling. New seats at the gates with electrical outlets are also a major plus, allowing you to charge your phone while you wait for your plane. One downside of Norfolk International, though, is the WiFi. It is very hard to connect to and hardly works. Aside from that, though, this is a small, practical, no-frills airport that is impossible to get lost in and is located near the Norfolk Botanical Gardens (another positive).",1,ORF

A lot of construction taking place at this time in the check-in area, I guess in an effort to modernize the airport and expand passenger capacity. The terminals themselves, again, are a little dated, but still nice enough and functional. TSA Pre-Check operates smoothly here, even where there are a lot of Pre-Checkers in line. Personnel, whether they're working at check-in, for TSA, in a restaurant, or at the boarding gate, are usually super bubbly, but still professional, helpful and polite.

She said my neck pillow, which had grains in it, could be explosive. She swabbed it on the outside then took out the sealed insert and swabbed the inner layer. And said “people try and take explosives, it could be explosive” my response was. “It's a neck pillow” if those weren’t allowed to take on flights, then put a sign up! The arrogance of the TSA staff is ridiculous. 30 minutes to let through 10 people! The two families with small children in front of me are not security risks. They’re now super stressed out single moms! Because you took apart all of their children’s things and made them wait in a line for no reason. It felt just like they were being mean and literally searching through every persons bags. It was the worst security experience ever, and I’ve flown through JFK and it’s not like the other TSA agents were doing anything, at least 10 of them they were just standing around talking about their weekend. Flying can already be stressful, there’s no need for the drama over neck pillows. It was ridiculous.

Yes, at times TSA slows things down to a crawl, but the TSA workers here seem to actually have a sense of pride and a sense of humor. I have a steel hip and this has caused numerous delays in other airports but either they know me by now or they have their collective ish together. Food offerings are decent and the Powell's Bookstore is a great place to grab a book for your flight.

Airport traffic was light with several empty spaces for cars to pull up to the curb. I had been there no more than 2-3 minutes when a military-looking airport security guard suddenly started pounding on my passenger window. ""Get out of here!"" I rolled down the window to tell him I had waited for notice my passenger was available and he leaned all the way into my car and shouted, ""If it was alright for you to be here, would I be talking to you?"" I pulled my head back so fast I smacked the driver's door. He was completely out of control and shouting as if a major emergency were happening. I sincerely thought he was going to hit me or continue striking my car. I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye and was immediately afraid for her safety. I pulled away as fast as I could so he wouldn't realize she was connected to me. I'm 62 and a small woman. Portland International Airport doesn't deserve all the high ratings.

Got to my boarding area, Southwest C12, and sat down to read and wait ... looked down and the metal bar between the seats was covered with filth.

",False,  40 minutes to get through security. 25 in line and then the worst was the arrogant attitude of all TSA when my bag was pulled to be checked - it sat there for 5 minutes. 4 workers stood right there within 3 feet of it talking to each other. After 5 minutes another woman walked nearby and I went to her and said my bag has been there 5 minutes - she had an arrogant attitude as well and said with an annoyed tone - someone will get to it. I waited another 3 minutes - 2 of the 4 talking walked the other direction and 2 still talked a minute or more - I tried to get their attention but was ignored. I saw another man standing around and told him my bag had been there almost 10 minutes - same attitude - “someone will get to it”. With an attitude a minute later a still waiting - I saw a woman who I complained to and she said same thing with an attitude. Meanwhile a TSA man had gone to the next row over and started checking 2 or 3 bags that had come out way after mine - mine was only bag for a full five minutes at least. It took 15 minutes.

Has enough seating for everyone on the flight. I once flew in to LAX and we had 3 hours till our next flight and there was no seating, well there was some, but only enough for about 20 passengers.

At the D/E security check, my husband and I were told that our TSA passes on our phones 'could have been photo-shopped' so we'd need to proceed through security as usual - unpacking liquids, toiletries, digital devices, removing our shoes and jackets. This was super unusual and uncalled for. What is the point of paying for the additional service and being frequent travelers if there is no recognition of our ability to comply?

Yes he said hell because it surprised him and he is 22. Then the guy got all upset because he said hell and told me he cursed at him when he didn't. The guy wasn't even wearing a uniform or a badge! He was completely rude to me when I asked why he had to shove his stuff down! Even the people around us where talking about how rude he was to my son so I know it wasn't just us. Then we were just at the airport this last weekend and there was a normal size line for security and it was moving fine. We got past the licence check and this little guy was yelling at people to ""Pick a line or I will pick one for you!!"" Everyone was moving fine there was an older lady who was a little slow because of her age and she looked so upset by what he said. Why do they feel they need to be so rude?!

I cannot find a better airport than Portland in terms of access, TSA service, parking, car rental, and restaurants. It is small enough to have that hometown feeling unlike LAX or SFO yet large enough that you will notice the long lines at peak periods. Yet, the TSA seems to be much more responsive and best of all, compassionate in this most painful point of travel. They seem to be able to open new lines, cross cover one another and be cheerful at the same time. Best of PDX is that the provide an area to accommodate families and fiends to greet incoming pax. All other airports just want you to drop off and get out. Here they have stores and restaurants outside of the security where we can meet and greet. I do not recall any other airport like this.

I cut everyone in line and spoke with a lady at the counter who said they announced for all people on my flight to go directly to the counter ahead of the line. I told her no one in line can hear anything they are saying. She said that’s what she’d been telling her coworkers. After she confirmed I couldn’t get a new flight for 2 days I sat and waited for my ride to come back and get me and I then witnessed an employee walk around and shout the names of 3 destinations whose flights were needing to have customers go to the front of the line immediately to check in.

The problem we have every time we travel into or from PGD is that they have inconsistent rules nearly every time. We have TSA pre-check which we paid to obtain. At all other airports this allows us to leave our shoes belts and light jackets on as well as laptops and ipads in our bags. Not at PGD. Even though they hand us a piece of paper that identifies us as TSA pre-check travelers we have to remove belts, jackets and laptops/ipads nearly every single time. It is as if the TSA agents at PGD went to completely different classes than every other agent in the country. Not to mention how rude some of them can be about it as well. I really try to avoid this airport as much as possible.",-1,PGD

The scanner was obviously malfunctioning. How do I know? Well, I was clean but it kept saying I wasn't.  Then, walking on the tarmac to the plane, a baggage handler insisted that I had to ""valet"" my carry-on bag. Once inside, seeing the mostly empty luggage bays, I complained to the flight attendant. She went and brought the bag to me with apologies Arrival was okay, but the I had to follow a ""bread crumb"" trail of corridor, stairs and turns -- all with inadequate signage. Eventually I arrived at two luggage bays and was (at first) relieved to see my flight posted as ""unloading."" But it turned out that we did not get our luggage in hand for 1hr 50mins. No information from the uncommunicative employee in the Baggage Office. She said they were trying to find the agent to ""see if he has any more bags."" (I'm being generous here). She told me to scan a lost baggage claim code -- which did not work.",-1,PHL

No information given over the speakers as to any changes. We have to constantly check the app. No airline attendants at the gate at all to ask any questions. (This is for aa flight 437). The lounge air was freezing and people were not prepared for that. Also the food areas that the airport offers in this section have no prices in the menu and he. You look it up online who the heck is paying $25 for a burger. Not even in London airports are they that expensive. And the cleanliness of the gate was atrocious. No one came by to clean up the trash all over the floor. It just seems like the airport did not care enough to provide good customer service. And the airline was a joke in giving us current information over the speaker system. I am rating this a 2/10 and that is generous!,-1,PHL

Apart from the wait - the condition of the public restrooms and general cleanliness is embarrassing. The Philly airport aligns with Philly’s nickname - Filthadelpehia - why can’t we be better than this? Ideas - larger bathroom stalls so an individual traveling by their self can enter with their luggage? Warm water and soap to wash hands. Sensors that actually work and stay on while you are washing.

Gate lounges were dirty and no trash picked up. Quick food place by gate 19 had gross looking sandwiches behind case, husband saw worker touch garbage then pick up slices of ham without washing his hands. Workers, including stores, restaurants, airline workers had bad attitudes, some not even acknowledging you spoke to them or asked a question of them.

I counted three desks open for hundreds of arriving passengers, it took around an hour to get to the front where I was greeted by a surly immigration officer. No smile, no ""hello"", just barking demands. Once I was through that I needed to change terminal to get my connection to Knoxville, which led to another problem, a distinct lack of signs. Eventually I found the shuttle bus and proceeded to security where a female employee was screaming, actually screaming at passengers. I overheard another employee ask her to dial it down but she ignored him and continued the screaming. Brilliant. Eventually made it to my gate only to find there was a distinct lack of seating, with people standing here there and everywhere. On my return trip I was heading to LHR on an AA 787, and was shocked at how few seats there were at the gate. Overall, it's a big airport with the staffing levels and seating provision of a small airport which also assumes passengers know the airport inside out and don't need signs to get where they need to be.",-1,PHL

We had a connecting flight Air Canada same day at 4.35PM. We had to pick up our bags and go thru security check again. They sent us thru a second Agriculture security check. We begged them that we are Canadian citizens but they would not allow us to bypass the queue for inspection of bags. We missed our onwards flight. We dropped of our bags after security and bags left for Toronto on April 20 and we were left behind. We check into a hotel as there was no night flight, bought new American Airlines tickets and left on April 21 at 8.35am.We lost $1600 for no fault of ours.

Their general demeanour is passing the buck to someone else. It would be generous to say they had any idea of how baggage control works. They have passengers running from one belt to another, like musical belts early in the morning or late in the evening, often losing passengers baggage because of connecting flights with the very lethargic excuse, well its not here. As someone who has never had missing baggage prior to my experience in Philadelphia, I was disappointed. There are one or two young members who were exceptional in the baggage area, one young man and a young lady working for Air Lingus, really adept at their work inspite of their young age. The rest of the Airport is hopeless, from security to check in to any other member of staff, completely lack any kind of civil behavior.",-1,PHL

It is such a filthy and in some cases unhygienic (bathrooms at baggage claim) experience. It’s embarrassing to know international travelers arrive and this is the first impression they will have. Only to then have their experience topped by airline, TSA, airport staff who scream at passengers while relaying messages. American Airlines desk agents really are something else in Philly. If you’ve never been aggressively screamed at, at 6am for no reason other than to inform you of bag check procedure while waiting in line, come to PHL. The family in front of me asked if this was a normal occurrence. Another passenger assure them it was indeed. The contrast to European or South American airports is jarring. I fly for work once a week and still am in constant disbelief of how little management seems to care about any of it. Employees unwilling to answer question while taking breaks lounging all over the terminal, on their phones blaring TikToks, trash strewn in random corners, displaced people often with mental health challenges living out of baggage claim (often times yelling at arriving passages as I experienced last night). I could go on. Lower every expectation to zero and you will still be disappointed by your experience at PHL. Consistently rude, filthy and mismanaged.",-1,PHL

2023-10-27,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,It was shocking,False,"  This airport was awful. Having just returned from travel in the UK with great airport experiences I was embarrassed by nearly every aspect of this facility and the staff. It was shocking. Upon arrival we were yelled at and glared at and mistreated by agents and staff. The airport was absolutely filthy and in disrepair. The bathroom in the international arrivals area reeked and had a thick ring of grime around the entire perimeter and on every surface. There was no toilet roll in two of the stalls and a large puddle of urine on the floor of another. The faucets were broken, soap dispensers empty, and bins overflowing. It was disgusting. There were few people willing or able to answer questions or give directions but plenty of employees standing around chatting. The TSA agents were horrible beyond belief. As I was repacking my things following the scans, one agent took my laptop computer. I said where’s my laptop and he said he thought I’d left it and had given it to an officer. I asked where and he pointed in a general direction and walked away. When I inquired with someone else, he snickered and took it back to a different line than the one I’d gone through and rescanned it so I was stuck behind a large group of other people picking up their things. He thought this was hilarious as did the rest of the crew. Meanwhile, my duty free purchases were routed down yet another line for a deeper check. When I found where my bag was, I watched as the employee pulled everything out of it, wiped it with a test strip, and then handed the strip to someone else to scan. Finally, without saying anything to me, the employee shoved my purchases in my general direction and just walked away, leaving all of my things just strewn about the table. It was absolutely chaotic and haphazard. Someone asked if there might be hidden cameras around because we would clearly, obviously be told that this was a joke and we were being set up for a comedy show. I wish! There were three people who were lovely. A security officer in arrivals, the person who took my bag for the next leg of my trip, and the American Airlines gate attendant for my connecting flight. Every single other interaction was horrible. Aside from those three exceptional individuals, the entire experience at the Philadelphia airport was shameful and I was so embarrassed that this was the first experience of the states so many people will have.",-1,PHL

Coming in from American Airlines.. terminal C baggage claim at the elevator, and it smells like straight urine! It’s unacceptable that the toilets are falling apart, that there’s trash everywhere - inside and out of the airport - and it smells like urine”. As of September 20th the area near the C parking elevator still smells like urine. I guess these reviews are not read or believed. The rugs in baggage claim and leading up to the gates are dirty and smell. The parking garage elevators are filthy and always have trash in them. The bathrooms are filthy. The bathroom floors are disgusting. Pushing around dirty water with a mop does not clean the floor. The parking booths are always broken. Parking is way over priced. For many travelers to Philadelphia, the airport is their first impression. A disgrace. How can O’Hare and smaller airports do it so well? It is true the airport needs major capital improvements, but how about basic cleaning and maintenance? It is evident that the airport leadership does not walk through the airport. If they do and the condition is this deplorable, they should resign or be fired.",-1,PHL

2023-09-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,it is so confusing,True,"  You should offer a workshop for first time flyers at international airport because it is so confusing. For example, when approaching the airport, I had to circle around 3 times until I was able to find the correct exit or lane for parking my car for a long term stay. There was an airport worker man standing at the entrance area and he offered little assistance to me as I was struggling to understand what to do. I asked him a few times what I needed to do and he said, ""push the red button"" but had zero people skills and made me feel unwelcome. I then tried to figure out the elevator, which didn't seem to be working. I then had to carry all my luggage down 4 flights of stairs. I was flying American Airlines, so my goal was to find the security check in to have all my stuff checked out. I somehow ended up in the wrong area. The airport man behind the counter mumbled something to me about where to go but I honestly had no idea what to do with his directions. I ended up in the baggage claim area for arriving flights, instead of where I needed to be. At this point, I was getting stressed and feeling stupid. I went back to the same airport man and asked him again to direct me. He mumbled the same directions to me and I was off again not knowing where to go or which automatic staircase to go up or go down. I then asked someone, another flyer where I could go for American Airlines departing flights for a check in process. Finally, I felt like I was in the right area. And then the lady airport worker then tells me that I have to go up the staircase to another area for security checking of my bags. I took a break from my confusion and just stood by a table. I felt like I was being treated like a beef cow in line to be slaughtered. It was as of all the airport workers could care less about the travelers and they were all just cattle flowing through the hallways. It was a horrible feeling. And to improve the navigation of passengers, I think Philadelphia International Airport should offer an online video for people who will fly for the first time out of their airport. It would help all of us navigate it better. Once I found the proper Gate, I was able to finally sit down and gather my thoughts, my mental state and gather myself all back together again.",-1,PHL

As an airline employee, I travel very often and get a chance to experience different crews, lounges, and airports. PHL is one I would avoid if I could. Starting from the incredibly latent and disorganized TSA agents where working as slowly as possible and being as rude as possible seems to be a key qualifier for the positions, to rude customs agents, to rude American Airlines counter agents (as standby benefits flyers), my partner and I were asked to pay a fee at the gate before boarding - that was a first, and a call to corporate checked the seemingly new attendant that was working with no apology afterwards. To add to this, rude bar staff at Chilies and Pete’s in C gate terminal that would kicked my party from their seating after having purchased food from the restaurant, but not their section of the restaurant, and then again to a man next to us. I choose not to use my priority pass benefits at the “spa” relax massage due to the attitude from the massaging/receptionist working.

Cramped ugly terminals arranged in such a way that you either walk a mile (no exaggeration) or take a very inconvenient bus shuttle between terminals. Adding to this is the heavy air traffic in the Boston to Washington corridor that guarantees that any weather other than severe clear will cause a delay. Stupidly, American consolidated its previous hub in Pittsburgh into Philadelphia. Pittsburgh has a very nice, spacious airport away from the east coast traffic and weather. Anything for a buck. BTW, American's hub in Charlotte isn't much better than Philadelphia at probably the second worst airport.

Philadelphia airport is unfortunately the worst airport I’ve been to in North America. It’s not clean, it’s super outdated and desperately needs a renovation. The restrooms are unbelievably dirty. And most stalls without hooks to hang your bag or coat. I’ve parked and gone into the terminal to pick up friends and have felt unsafe waking from parking to the arrivals area. There were people sleeping in the hallways on the long and confusing walk, with confusing signage, from the parking area. Staff are friendly for the most part.

Year-round, you have to exit the building, in all weather scenarios, and board a shuttle bus to gates. Thus might not be so bad if the shuttle stopped at each terminal, but it does not, so wherever you need to go, there us still walking involved, sometimes back to the gate you need but just drove past. When landing, American Airlines said they were holding connecting flights, but mine was gone when I reached the gate after having to wait for then hop the shuttle bus. Then, when I wanted to go back, from gate F to Gate B to get a hotel room, I was told the shuttle was closed for the night .. it was not yet 9 p.m. When I asked an AA manager for a ride on a cart from F to B, he denied my request.

Is there any money being invested here? If there is it’s invisible. The overall look is tired. Almost every terminal has a different look; many of them very aged and dirty. The lack of TSA check points is sub par for an airport this size. So much of the overall équipent is broken. Today several escalators were out of service. In terminal A East the security line snaked back since only one X-ray Machine worked. At the gate the scanner didn’t work and the gate agents had to manually enter passengers on a computer.

Some even ignored us and did not respond to our request for help at all. Very unprofessional and not welcoming at all for this so called city of brotherly love. The worst experience ever.

So as I’m trying to find out where he’s going with my ticket since I have 10 min at this point to find terminal F and the shuttle to it and he starts being very rude to me and raising his voice so I ask for my ticket back and tell him if he’s going to treat me like that then I don’t want his help. His response is to holler at me as I’m walking away still being rude and hollering that he hopes I miss my flight. Rudest, most unprofessional person I have ever had the displeasure of being around. Then I asked at the shuttle if I was in the right place to make sure that I was and the 2 ladies there just point and holler terminal F! Could have just nicely said ""yes this way"".

And be careful with your luggage at baggage claim. They never have the right track marked with your arriving flight.

Anyway when I went to take off my flip flops in the security line I accidentally ripped the top part holding the right flip together. That meant the only way I could have walk was to walk barefoot with my right foot and carry the flip flop. Right when I was about to do that walking away from security after I got though they said they didn’t want me to have to walk through barefoot so they called someone to push me to where my flight was in a wheelchair so instead of my foot touching the ground it was on the footrest of the wheelchair.,1,PHL

I was a bit flustered while getting to the gate - as many are in airports, and as a consequence I left my souvenir on the seat. I realised this on the flight and when I landed in Melbourne, I first asked The Virgin Airlines staff to help me - which they refused, telling me its not their issue and to contact Lost and found. I immediately contacted lost and found, only to be told that it will either be stolen or handed in. Even though I described to them exactly where it would be - after only an hour in transit - the women refused to send someone to check if it was there, claiming that is 'not part of their policy'. Really, how difficult is it to just check if somethings there or not?

The security check was calm and in control, ample signage ensured that even non-seasoned travellers knew what had to be removed from their bags.

We had to wait in four (4) different lines, totalling almost three (3) hours. Throughout the stressful lines for customs kiosk, customs agent, agriculture and TSA, all but one TSA agent were yelling and being rude to the people waiting in line. There were no clear directions on where to line up at agriculture, yet an employee was yelling at the people to line up a certain way. She got even ruder and more upset with people when they did not understand her directions. I heard employees complain about not getting paid to load baggage on the conveyer belt and how they better get disability if they get hurt, this was all in front of the people in line. No one monitored people cutting in front of others in the lines. The airport is poorly organized and definitely does not demonstrate 'brotherly love', despite Philadelphia's motto.

It became so uncomfortable that at one point we ventured out back thru security just to get some fresh air. The airport is OK but, security is rude and sorry but if you can't get our bags on the connecting flight what's the point? Airplane boarding went fine but here is where the glitch comes in. It's March so they have to de-ice. We sat on the tarmac for over 3 hours as apparently someone forgot to put in an order for the actual supply and they ran out of de-icer fluid. The pilot was peeved and again no ventilation on the plane so temps now reaching well into the 90's. Separate review of American, sadly this is what flying comes down to now.

At night, there is no alternative to the ""self-serve"" exit kiosks. I was trapped behind a driver whose credit card was eaten by the machine. The entire line slowly backed their cars up, I pulled into another line, and found to my horror that it was demanding a ticket from the entry kiosk.

My flight was cancelled on Sunday and I was delayed hours on Monday. I couldn't find a place to sit and plug devices in so I sat in a hallway. This facility is so inefficient and poorly run.

American has a nice Admirals club, friendly staff there. Low rating is due to very unfriendly gate staffing. Little concern for customers and not helpful.

I especially enjoyed the airside walk between Terminals A and F in order to connect between domestic and international flights: it was a healthy 15-minute walk through a suburban shopping mall with reasonable food choices along the way. But PHL is far from perfect. Many water fountains and electrical outlets do not work: this is a needless frustration. When I arrived at Customs and Border Patrol at around 4PM from an international flight, the area was overwhelmed by too many passengers, almost no help for passengers coping with cryptic passport kiosks, and seriously understaffed CBP posts. PHL shows great promise but needs to attend to simple maintenance and very inadequate CBP operations.",1,PHL

Although they have redone some of the terminals and added many food options, they have not redone the staff. The staff at this airport are rude and unfriendly overall. I say this as a ""thick skinned"" New Yorker. Although I am sure there are exceptions, I have never found one.

Unbelievably they have no electronic passport entry points so everyone is dealt with manually. We had almost 3 hours to change flights on a trip from Manchester to Miami. We made our connection with literally one minute to spare after rushing through the airport! Passport checking took an hour and a half and then full security check the same. Many in the queues are stressed as they know they are going to miss connections. The staff seem to take delight in advising that no one can go to the front of the queue because almost everyone is late for a connection. I will not be using this airport again.,-1,PHL

I have traveled with American Airlines all over this country and the Caribbean. I have been to Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Myers, San Francisco, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Aruba, St Thomas, and Nassau with American on most of these and Southwest on the others. I never have a problem in any of these Airports. Philadelphia on the other hand is a disaster, where do I begin. Let’s start with constant delays in take off, there are always 10 to 12 planes ahead of you. When pulling back into Philadelphia 10 minutes early only to have to wait 30 minutes till they find an open gate. Then you go to get your luggage and a hour later they tell you they have a maintenance issue. The signage to leave the Airport is probably the most confusing of any airport that I have been to. You leave from gate C so you park in that garage only to return at A Gate, this happens all the time. The B/C Security is far too small to handle the crowds that come to this gate, passengers are lined up down the corridor to the parking garage! If I could get the flights I need out of Allentown I would drive the additional hour just to avoid this place.",-1,PHL

I'm embarrassed that this is ""my airport"". Each restroom I used smelled like a barn. Stalls, toilets and floors were filthy. Never did I see anyone cleaning anything. In March, my PHL flight to Miami was cancelled due to weather, I used Baltimore (BWI). Both BWI and MIA were clean, modern and nice. Today I'm at Chicago's O'Hare- very clean and modern! In recent months I was in the Tampa airport, also very clean. Even if something is old it can be clean! The restaurant scene is also very poor at PHL compared with others.

It is ridiculous that they make you collect your luggage and go through all controls, check in and security again even when you are on in transit. This is the biggest waste of time and ludicrous. They do not keep their flight departure times up to date and so we were running through the airport to get our connecting flight as it said it was on time, however 2.5 hours after the said departure time I am still waiting to leave for London. The gate number changed 5 or 6 times confusing everyone and now we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour and it appears they have lost half of the planes luggage. The pilot has had to get off of the aircraft to try and sort this out because everyone is clueless. Absolutely ridiculous airport will definitely avoid ever returning here.

I usually fly into Boston, where international arrivals are a zoo and can take hours. In Philadelphia, passport control was quick and friendly, and the free wifi worked immediately. We were through in less than 10 minutes. Flying out, the terminal was clean, lots of seating and power stations, and fantastic free wifi. We had plenty of food choices (though a few less fast food and more healthy options would be great) and well organized lounges. But the shining crown was the response of lost and found, after my son left his Nintendo in the waiting lounge. We filled out the online form and within 2 hours had a response that the item was found. They organized having it sent to us (we pay postage, of course), and a ""disaster"" was averted seamlessly.

2018-01-30,0.5,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,flights never depart on time,False,"  I'm at Philadelphia airport at least once a year and I'd like to think I know it pretty well by now. I can't say Philadelphia airport is the worst airport I've ever been to as it's clean, has a lot of places to get food and shop, there are a few places to charge your phone, and most of the staff I have encountered are friendly. My only problems with this airport are that flights never depart on time because boarding almost always starts when the flight was supposed to originally take off, it's impossible to get a wifi connection and some of the staff can be quite careless. I was recently in a position where I had a connecting flight and was put on standby and left to sit around the gate even after the plane had taken off just to be informed I would not be put on the flight, and if I managed to get on the next one I would be stranded in Arizona overnight for possibly 3 whole days. I had only ever agreed to originally being on standby as the person who booked my ticket had assured me I'd be on the plane, so I can understand what the other reviewers are talking about when they comment on confusion among staff. I had to talk to 3 people before having to cancel my flight and pay for a new ticket, but the situation left me stuck in Philadelphia, as I had come from New Jersey. I wish Philadelphia airport had more options when it comes to getting from there to Jersey and vice versa as Philadelphia airport is the only airport near Jersey besides New York (Atlantic City doesn't count). Other than those flaws it is an airport and it does get the job done - maybe not in the best way possible, but good enough to still go to.",1,PHL

You have to queue to use the terminals, you then have to queue again to be questioned by a CBP agent. On this trip the queue time for the agent review was in excess of 40 minutes and I nearly missed my connecting flight. It is unacceptable that when two or three wide bodied international planes arrive in short order there are only eight of 30+ CBP desks open. Also, even when you're in transit, you have to pass through security screening again. I cannot recommend this airport if you have a tight schedule for a connecting flight.",-1,PHL

I had over an hour to make my flight and get to the security check line. It was about a 1/2 mile long because they would not open three of the lines due to giving TSA precheck priority. Once I finally got through the checkpoint, I had 30 minutes to catch my flight. Security decided they would pull me aside to check my bags. This wouldn't have been a problem had I not been behind four other people, one of which had about one hundred bite size snickers in her bag. They checked each stupid snicker four times. This took forever. I asked if I could just leave my food behind so they didn't have to check it, and I would just bring my keys, wallet, and cellphone. They wouldn't budge at all. Once they finally checked my food bag, I ran like a fool as fast as I could to make it to my flight. Once I got to my gate, they had already boarded. Surprisingly, it wasn't just me who missed the flight. There were 6 other people (just for my flight) that had missed the flight. Spare yourself and don't go to Philadelphia airport.",-1,PHL

",True," This was definitely my worst experience at an airport. It's been years since I have last traveled by plane so a little direction from the employees would have helped but barely any was given throughout the whole process, and the only time they did was either with an attitude or by harassing you. The woman who weighed and took my luggage was an absolute joke. I asked her multiple times what I had to do first, since it's been a while, to make both her and my job easier but she insisted on giving me a hard time and actually asked me why I didn't know what to do? Maybe because she couldn't do the only job she had and tell me. It would have taken 2 seconds to understand and get that process over with but she obviously had some personal issues or horrible customer service skills. There is no comparison with this airport and the airports in Florida where I traveled to. Philadelphia already has a bad reputation and a lot of the employees there definitely make it worse, it's embarrassing. I will try my very best to stay away from this airport in the future due to the lack of good customer service.",-1,PHL

At the TSA control I showed the boarding pass that the connection flight was already boarding; the answer I got was to wait them to check my bag while they were teaching the new hired guy. The TSA guy told me not to ""make everyone aware that I was missing the flight"". I rushed to the gate and there was still few people boarding.

At 10:30 PM, I could find no airport personnel to help and an airline employee whom I was able to find seemed genuinely annoyed and displeased that I was asking him for assistance. Upon my return, the rental car return was extremely confusing and nobody from the rental car agency could be found to assist me. I just dropped my car and prayed that I had left it in the right spot and wouldn't incur any additional charges. Once I arrived at my terminal from the Sky Train, signage initially directed me to ticketing and check-in, but then the signage abruptly stopped when I reached the escalators and a four-way intersection. I looked all over and there was no more signage to tell me where to go. Another passenger saw my confusion and directed me where to go. Once I received directions, I looked for additional signage in the direction I was sent, and could find none.",-1,PHX

After being the last to disembark from a British Airways flight from London, I mustered up what little strength I had as I approached Passport Control. The woman at the entrance to Passport Control took one look at me and said, ""You are having a medical emergency. Come with me to the wheelchair line."" She whisked me to the front of that line and waited for the EMT staff to wait on me. I was taken to the Banner Medical Center via ambulance where we discovered I had an acute case of Pulmonary Embolism. I was going to try to push through my final flight to Tucson and get tomy home city. Had she not recognized the acute state of emergency I was in and taken me to get care, I may well have died.

I went through Phoenix in transit. Flights were on time in my case. However I had a hankering for a smoothie since I ate some food brought onto the airplane. Since I had lots of time, I went to every set of gates. You can't even buy a smoothie in this airport. Panera Bread had some on the menu but were all sold out. Every flavor. No wonder! Many restaurants were not even open. I travel a lot, and this airport is now near the bottom.  Covid is no excuse because I have traveled much during the pandemic. A few other things.  The charging stations are all on little block tables that are always very crowded. Some of the outlets are so worn out that your adapter falls out or you have to shake it to connect. But usually you can find one that will work There are no outlets in lounge seats at all. Some signs do not show gates in both directions. Went towards the C-Gates and had to look backwards to see that I had to turn left for C1 to C9. I surmised that because I have airport experience but woe to the person who does not.

Twice, we have reserved a rental car and showed up to no cars available. We make other arrangements now. The food and service options have taken a nose dive. The ‘we don’t care less feeling' is palpable from people working everywhere throughout food service options, which I might add is almost null.

No restaurants open, no staff to help, and extremely overpriced sandwich/chip options. Since it's silly to eat dinner at 6pm, we wanted to sit at the airport at a bar/restaurant like every other airport in the world, not Phoenix airport. After arriving at 8, everything was closed which is absurd and unheard of in the travel industry. After looking through every single gate for over an hour, we had to settle on a self-serve kiosk. Give a guess how much 2 sandwiches, 2 fruit juice, 1 bag of chips, and some pathetic soggy veggies was? If you guessed anything lower than $47, then you're wrong. Absolute abomination and the management needs to learn how to get a grasp with their pathetic excuse for an airport. Just quit your jobs now and give it to someone that will actually look after the customer. FYI, whilst eating our ""dinner"" there were many other travellers in the same boat desperately looking for food and stressing to find something for their flight.

How are you supposed to carry 4, 70 pound tool boxes to the parking garage. No skycaps, no luggage carts. Whoever runs the airport and makes these decisions without thinking of the inconvenience to passengers who I am sure have had to deal with the same issue is an idiot.

This was confirmed at the information desk within Terminal 3 that there are zero luggage carts available. With Sky Harbor being an international airport within a large metropolitan city, this is truly disgraceful. My wife arrived last night from abroad with our 2 small children, 3 large suitcases, 3 carry on bags, and a large back pack. I recently had back surgery and could offer no assistance to my spouse with moving luggage due to lifting restrictions. After a 24 hour international trip and consoling our four year old daughter along the route by picking her up, she was already complaining of a sore back when they arrived. After all that, my wife had to make three separate trips lugging large suitcases clear across the airport to the parking garage while I helplessly watched our children. At no time did anyone at the airport volunteer to offer any help or assistance. This is fundamentally wrong, irresponsible, and shows complete lack of planning and foresight by airport management in every possible way. People traveling into and out of Sky Harbor will need to bring along additional hands and resources since the airport is unable to provide the very basic necessities or help all airports, regardless of size should possess.",-1,PHX

I got my bag slammed in my face and was told to not touch anything. After this experience we arrived to the terminal at 3:00 expecting for restaurants to be open for dinner, this is a invalid thought as the restaurants decide when they can open and close. The google and/or Apple Maps isn’t even accurate to the time they will close. We arrived at the Panera two minutes after closing and they wouldn’t even serve us, resulting in forcing us to eat at a quick store for a $20 sandwich.

I asked if someone could please assist us so we could get to our luggage and I was told to wait and eventually someone would help us. We continued to wait for approximately 10 more minutes. Meanwhile listening to the TSA officer cuss under his breath.

We had bottles on the floor around our gate. As for the gate, we couldn’t hear the flight attendant telling us about our flight because there was a TV show playing in the speakers above us, when we told them they said there was nothing they could do and just to come closer, there are over 70 people on this aircraft and you want all of us around the gate?

One of the worst designed airports and even without the design my service experience was terrible. Flight sat on the runway for 30 min. Bags took forever to come out. Had to wait in line for a bus to the car rental place. Car rental place was 15 minutes away. It’s a desert, are you telling me you couldn’t build one closer? How valuable is your sand? Signage was bad at the rental car place. Lines were bad because a bus load of people got there at the same time. Phoenix airport mentions that they will be getting a train connection to the car rental in a couple years. First of all, that means they know they suck even if they want to claim and trademark that they are the friendliest airport. It also doesn’t make the long drive to the rental any better. Instead of a bus now I’m gonna be on a tram. Great job Phoenix. The day service is determined within the first 20 minutes of the experience.

Phoenix Sky Harbor is really not bad, the lines are usually short, getting through security is pretty fast, tons of great stores and restaurants open. However, there is basically no international flights which really sucks but LAX is a 1 hour flight away so it’s not really that big of an issue. As for domestic flights, they have one to basically every large city and often. Bathrooms are clean, WiFi is fantastic, not a lot of gate seating though.

They say there is a golf cart to help transport but I’ve only seen it once in twenty times and it was full. So you just have to walk with your luggage. Good luck. If you land past 9:30pm they close several of the exits in Terminal 4 so you have to walk twice as far just to get out of the terminal, then you have to walk back to baggage claim or your car. They make hundreds and hundreds of passengers walk late at night so they can close two exits and save on one security guard’s wages—not friendly, annoying after a long day of travel. There are 8 gates at the end of the B concourse that are squeezed into the space that one or two gates would be. It’s crazy, people pushing each other, literally lines crossing each other to get onto the plane and no seating, everyone has to stand or sit on the floor. Why crush 8 gates into such a small space? Not friendly. Creates angry passengers. Honestly I’m trying to find what is friendly about PHX.",-1,PHX

At check in the said Gate A 6 An hour later they switched to gate A 20 (another pier). An hour later the sent me back to A 11. Then after that 1.5 hours before departure they switched me to gate B 13. As I passed AA passenger assistance counter in The B Gate pier, one of the two AA employees pulled the ribbon closed in front of me and said “Closed!” At 9:45. I just wanted to ask her if they were going to change us again. She stepped out passed the ribbon she closed and pointed 100 feet back up the B gate pier for me to go look at the overhead flight boards. Never an apology. And for this so am paying for First Class. A decent company would offer a refund. The airport food service facilities are wholly inadequate with passengers waiting in long lines to be seated. (Half hour wait at an airport)",-1,PHX

Phoenix is overall a great airport besides the lounge situation deteriorating and the lack of international flights. The Pros: - Ease of access - Good food options - Good Internet - Fast Security (unless they do the dog screening as they take some time to get setup and while they do the security checkpoint is closed) The Cons: - Major discrepancy in quality of services between terminals that are not connected - Lost it’s only Priority Pass lounge access in the afternoon - No Asia flights and maybe 1.2 flights a day to Europe (and I am generous) - If the flight to Frankfurt and London are at the terminal together it gets messy, there is no real room for international expansion - Rental car are on the other side of the planet.",1,PHX

First off, the departure and arrival boards are not anywhere that makes sense. After arriving from the car rental you have to proceed to any of the four gates (a,b, d,d). AB one side, CD on the other. So if you walk up to the gate at A and you’re on C, you have to walk all the way across the terminal. Not enough characters to complain about everything wrong but the other peeve of mine is a complete lack of seating, one bar per gate. Clearly the “Best Airport” in my opinion is outscored by almost all others that I travel to. Cancun even beats this place. Crowded, cranky service and old. Tear it down.",-1,PHX

Whoever put up the signs to different parts of the airport must have been drunk when they came to point drivers towards the T4 parking area ramp. The lane the sign points to is not the right access lane, it is on a slight bend, there are numerous other signs and you end up sailing past on the constant flow of traffic.

It was September 5th at 4.30 am, and I was heading to Screening zone before heading to the gate. There was a huge line up at that time and they opened 3 lanes for screening. 1 for express and 2 for general boarding. Apparently a screening-machine was malfunctioning in one of the 2 general boarding lanes. Instead of opening another lane to deal with the congested line, staffs merged two lanes into one. That resulted in adding extra 10~20 minutes of everyone's waiting time and limited space for people pick up their belongings after passing the screening line. While I was picking up my belongings after passing the screening-machine, staff said ""you are taking up too much space and not letting others having the space for picking up their belongings"". This was very upsetting because all this happened due to their malfunctioning machine and merging two lanes into one. I had never problem with this kind of situation because I pick up my belongings pretty fast. Lots of people were complaining at that time but staffs did nothing about it and did not want to open another lane to deal with this situation, that was very lazy of them and stupid. There really needs to be procedures to deal with this kind of situation. Otherwise it will happen again and that would be just silly, because this is an easy fix. Hopefully whoever works in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport see this review and bring it up in their meeting and come up with better procedure for this kind of situation.

Delta said the problem was Frontier's not theirs and we'd have to go to the ticket counter. The info counter person said she didn't have a phone and couldn't call. She has a phone. Frontier ticket counter said it's not their problem, the carousels belong to the City of Phoenix. City of Phoenix said that the carousel doesn't stop unless there's a jam and that's Frontier's problem. After about 45 minutes of this a Frontier ticket agent went into an elevator and got someone to finally react. Some mysterious guy apparently pushed on the flashing yellow light and the belts started moving. This shouldn't happen at what is claimed to be a Friendly Airport.

TSA lines are usually short, and there is absolutely no need to fear for safety, as the Pensacola Police Department, TSA, Escambia County Sheriff's Office, and United States Military Police (due to the extraordinary amount of military bases and armed forces personnel in the area) all patrol the airport and its grounds. Walking distance away from several hotels and recreation areas. Only about a 5 minute car or bus to Cordova Mall, and Sacred Heart Medical Center. As well as a ride to 10-15 minute car or bus ride to downtown, and a 20-30 minute ride to Pensacola Beach (depending on traffic on the Bay Bridge).

The open airport area may be nice in the spring and fall but is not practical and dangerous during rain, heat and/or colder times. Whoever thought this was a good idea maybe was ok many years ago but it’s not practical nor safe with huddle and bustle and people trying to get between gates and terminal’s quickly in the rain. TSA is also not appropriately spaced and or staffed for the current passenger load. Then, try to grab a bite to eat and you are out of luck with the 1 1/2 hour wait to get in and order food in the 1 very small restaurant. This airport needs a lot of work to safely and comfortably accommodate the passenger load.",1,PSP

A lot of construction taking place at this time in the check-in area, I guess in an effort to modernize the airport and expand passenger capacity. The terminals themselves, again, are a little dated, but still nice enough and functional. TSA Pre-Check operates smoothly here, even where there are a lot of Pre-Checkers in line. Personnel, whether they're working at check-in, for TSA, in a restaurant, or at the boarding gate, are usually super bubbly, but still professional, helpful and polite. PDX is neither stellar nor bad, it's above-average but with a lot of potential. And, it's better than Sea-Tac!",1,PWM

She said my neck pillow, which had grains in it, could be explosive. She swabbed it on the outside then took out the sealed insert and swabbed the inner layer. And said “people try and take explosives, it could be explosive” my response was. “It's a neck pillow” if those weren’t allowed to take on flights, then put a sign up! The arrogance of the TSA staff is ridiculous. 30 minutes to let through 10 people! The two families with small children in front of me are not security risks. They’re now super stressed out single moms! Because you took apart all of their children’s things and made them wait in a line for no reason. It felt just like they were being mean and literally searching through every persons bags. It was the worst security experience ever, and I’ve flown through JFK and it’s not like the other TSA agents were doing anything, at least 10 of them they were just standing around talking about their weekend. Flying can already be stressful, there’s no need for the drama over neck pillows. It was ridiculous.

Yes, at times TSA slows things down to a crawl, but the TSA workers here seem to actually have a sense of pride and a sense of humor. I have a steel hip and this has caused numerous delays in other airports but either they know me by now or they have their collective ish together. Food offerings are decent and the Powell's Bookstore is a great place to grab a book for your flight.

Airport traffic was light with several empty spaces for cars to pull up to the curb. I had been there no more than 2-3 minutes when a military-looking airport security guard suddenly started pounding on my passenger window. ""Get out of here!"" I rolled down the window to tell him I had waited for notice my passenger was available and he leaned all the way into my car and shouted, ""If it was alright for you to be here, would I be talking to you?"" I pulled my head back so fast I smacked the driver's door. He was completely out of control and shouting as if a major emergency were happening. I sincerely thought he was going to hit me or continue striking my car. I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye and was immediately afraid for her safety. I pulled away as fast as I could so he wouldn't realize she was connected to me. I'm 62 and a small woman. Portland International Airport doesn't deserve all the high ratings.

Do the math 15 machines then down to two agents guess what happened ... we all got through the machines quickly just to get stuck in a slow moving line for the worthless additional step. Then you grab you luggage and yet another agent only one this time checks your customers and passport again. Then you get on a bus to take you to the main baggage pick up area, why can’t you just walk like the rest of the airport access. And yes there was another line for the bus.

I am nearly 70 years old, female, I jerked away and he pulled me back and screamed at me to empty my pockets! I do not have things in my pockets, good grief.  Got to my boarding area, Southwest C12, and sat down to read and wait ... looked down and the metal bar between the seats was covered with filth. It was so thick you could run your fingers through it. So disgusting, I got up and looked for a clean seat, and they were all filthy, so I just got some exercise and walked for two hours.

",False,  40 minutes to get through security. 25 in line and then the worst was the arrogant attitude of all TSA when my bag was pulled to be checked - it sat there for 5 minutes. 4 workers stood right there within 3 feet of it talking to each other. After 5 minutes another woman walked nearby and I went to her and said my bag has been there 5 minutes - she had an arrogant attitude as well and said with an annoyed tone - someone will get to it. I waited another 3 minutes - 2 of the 4 talking walked the other direction and 2 still talked a minute or more - I tried to get their attention but was ignored. I saw another man standing around and told him my bag had been there almost 10 minutes - same attitude - “someone will get to it”. With an attitude a minute later a still waiting - I saw a woman who I complained to and she said same thing with an attitude. Meanwhile a TSA man had gone to the next row over and started checking 2 or 3 bags that had come out way after mine - mine was only bag for a full five minutes at least. It took 15 minutes. Rude people that don't care and think they are god because they have so much power over your life and you can’t do anything about it. I hate this airport.,-1,PWM

All of the staff are very nice and kind. I usually fly out of Portland on Alaska Airlines which I also think is the best U.S. carrier. It is relatively small and easy to navigate. Has enough seating for everyone on the flight. I once flew in to LAX and we had 3 hours till our next flight and there was no seating, well there was some, but only enough for about 20 passengers.

At the D/E security check, my husband and I were told that our TSA passes on our phones 'could have been photo-shopped' so we'd need to proceed through security as usual - unpacking liquids, toiletries, digital devices, removing our shoes and jackets. This was super unusual and uncalled for. What is the point of paying for the additional service and being frequent travelers if there is no recognition of our ability to comply? Portland, once a favored airport, and our former home airport at that, is now dropping to the unfavored list - akin to San Diego - an airport that we avoid.",-1,PWM

Yes he said hell because it surprised him and he is 22. Then the guy got all upset because he said hell and told me he cursed at him when he didn't. The guy wasn't even wearing a uniform or a badge! He was completely rude to me when I asked why he had to shove his stuff down! Even the people around us where talking about how rude he was to my son so I know it wasn't just us. Then we were just at the airport this last weekend and there was a normal size line for security and it was moving fine. We got past the licence check and this little guy was yelling at people to ""Pick a line or I will pick one for you!!"" Everyone was moving fine there was an older lady who was a little slow because of her age and she looked so upset by what he said. Why do they feel they need to be so rude?! There was no reason for him say that even if we were all slow!!  I sure hope my next trip to PDX will be much better.

I cannot find a better airport than Portland in terms of access, TSA service, parking, car rental, and restaurants. It is small enough to have that hometown feeling unlike LAX or SFO yet large enough that you will notice the long lines at peak periods. Yet, the TSA seems to be much more responsive and best of all, compassionate in this most painful point of travel. They seem to be able to open new lines, cross cover one another and be cheerful at the same time. Best of PDX is that the provide an area to accommodate families and fiends to greet incoming pax. All other airports just want you to drop off and get out. Here they have stores and restaurants outside of the security where we can meet and greet. I do not recall any other airport like this. Overall, just a smart, caring design that works for me.",1,PWM

I consider myself pretty easy going and let a lot of things brush over but the way my daughter and I were treated was completely uncalled for. It was myself and my 5 year old learning disabled daughter traveling home from a vacation visiting family in North Carolina. TSA yelled at and berated my daughter for struggling to follow exact instructions scaring her and made following instructions that much harder. It turned our already stressful day into a nightmare. I understand millions of people move through the airport and there are protocols that need to be followed for everyone’s safety but I can say with absolute certainty we will never fly into or out of Raleigh again. Experiencing one moody/rude person is easy to pass off as they are having a bad day but literally everyone!

I flew the non-stop AA flight from LHR into RDU. Even though I was in business class and was among the first to disembark, I believe all passengers entered the USA (border control), in 15 minutes or less. It took me 3 minutes from plane door to curbside.  Also, the airport is modern and clean, really nice staff. With just one or two daily incoming flights from Europe, I don't think there is a better way to travel into the USA from Europe. I connected the next morning on a very early (5 am) departure. Staff told me there was a 'morning rush', so I was a bit nervous about TSA opening only at 4 am. Arrived at 3:30 am, and soon after that TSA started processing passengers.

I was told by an employee that when flights are delayed they are supposed to receive a memorandum that will keep the restaurants open until those flights have departed. There are too many people that pay good money to fly and there are no accommodations to keep them comfortable and entertained until their departure. I strongly recommend the hours change from 8 to 10pm for closing time. I understand these places open up at 4.30 or 5am but you still have fliers who take flights late in the evening.

Twice this summer I had to experience the gridlock of cars attempting to pick up people at this terminal. There is no way to pull over to pick up people, even when they are right there waiting out front. The security officers yell at you to keep driving around, adding to traffic issues and do not give you a chance to pull over. My 80-year-old mother was stepping across several lanes of traffic to try and reach me and the security officer was yelling at both of us. I had already circled around 3 times! The poorly run arrival area looks like a COVID hotspot. If they would let you pick up passengers, there would be fewer problems. They should redirect rental car buses to another location or spread arrivals out so there are fewer people trying to be picked up at the same time.

As a fuller upper body, I am accustomed to being patted down due to being of ample upper body and whatever but this time, the TSA person, in my opinion went to far. I told her I had on spandx and she said “that’s just not spanx, you have something else”. I was absolutely flabbergasted. So, after being patted down to a degree of humiliation, she said” you can go.” There were all male TSA and male employees around. I know all this is for security. It’s not pleasant but I do understand. However, some things are just common sense. All other agents that day were professional and kind. Where as I would have rated this experience a 10, the TSA episode bumped the rating to 5.",1,RDU

I am pregnant traveling alone carrying my luggage and they made me go back to the end of the line for a small amount of water in my water bottle. The supervisor and check in staff were extremely rude and harsh. I ultimately had to throw away my water bottle since I was pressed for time.,-1,RDU
2017-09-02,0.5,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,,5.0,0.0,,,,wait an hour for a gate,False, I am normally quite happy with Raleigh-Durham but we just arrived back from vacation this evening and the airport made us wait for an hour until a plane could leave our predetermined gate. I have been at other airports that will just reassign the plane to another gate so that passengers can continue on with their journeys without the inconvenience of the delay. I found this extremely disappointing since I expected RDU to have a better customer satisfaction operation. I blame airport operations for this blunder and feel this could be addressed as an improvement opportunity.,1,RDU

Terminal 1, dominated by Southwest, is open, clean, and inviting. There were no lines at security, and I went through the TSA line within five minutes. The terminal was easy to navigate, with plenty of open space and updated arrival and departure screens for the various flights.

When we arrived in RDU, the gate was closed and passengers had to yell to be let out. I parked my car in parking lot 3 so needed to take airport bus. The bus was leaving as I got to the bus stop and I waved the lady to open the door for me and she refused. It was 2:30 AM. There was nobody else on the bus.

The management must be terrible for it to be so pervasive. Very slow day at airport so it’s not overwork issues. Example. At head of security line signs tell you to await next green light.

My bag is very distinct and when it didn't come through, I knew it was elsewhere. I took my baggage claim sticker over to the office and the staff were absolutely wonderful. He kindly assisted me and had a genuine demeanour that reassured me my bag would arrive later. He told me where it was and when it would arrive. Later in the afternoon, he called me right at the time he said he would to alert me of my suitcases arrival. When I went to pick it up, he was so kind and polite to me!

It is conveniently a short walk from the terminal but there is only an initial ramp and then there is no path for suitcase dragging people to go to the next row apart from the gaps between the cars. The different companies have small signs and it is impossible to know where to go. If one is unlucky then you need to walk back and forth to find your spot. Returning is the same problem to drive around and find the spot. I am writing this as I spoke to the rental company and it appears everyone complains but the airport will not do anything about this.

There is not one TV in the waiting areas. If there is a delay, there just are no seats available. Breakfast food was not available at 9am. They were out of both breakfast food and coffee by 9 am. The lines for pre packaged food were 20-30 people long. They need to visit an airport like Grand Rapids MI to get it right.

My boyfriend and I set our backpacks down after having gone through TSA already to go grab a bagel which couldn’t have been more than 10 minutes. When we came back to our seats there was a guard standing near our stuff with a dog. We didn’t think anything of it and then he approaches my boyfriend to belittle him in front of other people that you “can’t leave your bag unattended” and “it makes people unsettled”. He went on for about 5 minutes and then told us some other people may be coming to talk to us. All for a backpack ?! What is TSA for if you’re still worried about my bag?! Maybe this airports needs to put signs up saying not to leave bags unattended before they belittle their customers for their unwritten rules.

2024-09-10,0.3,Couple Leisure,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,,,,always disappointing,False," I've traveled extensively in my lifetime, to Airports all over the world. SD Lindberg Field is always disappointing. I flew out mid-morning on a Wednesday to Atlanta (ATL). Seating at our assigned gate was full / not adequate, so we sat at an empty gate nearby. ATL, I feel, is what every big city wishes there airport to be. Large, clean and efficient for people, planes and cars. ATL has a great ground transportation system in place and a Rental Car center, which is next level, with easy freeway access. My flight back to SD arrived early, but we spent the time gained sitting on the tarmac waiting for a gate. Once off the plane, I visited a small, crowded restroom across from my arrival gate, which obviously hadn't been cleaned for a while. It smelled like an outhouse. Baggage claim took longer as they had two flights using on one baggage carousel. The ride back to our car at an area parking business was problematic (another issue) due to short staffing. Also of note, riding in the overcrowded van, was how poorly maintained the roads, into and out of the airport, are. I know airport construction has been going on forever, but the roads around the airport need to be repaved. Good first impressions are important. If SD truly wants to be a world-class destination, it has to quit trying to make a small, single runway airport do the job and build a new, modern air (and ground) transportation center. You cannot shoe horn a large, efficient airport into the space Lindberg Field occupies. Sadly, in today's dollars, I don't see that happening. I'll look to use John Wayne Orange County or Ontario next time.",-1,SAN

Only 1 bathroom in terminal area….massive line and paper product shortages. Only 1 bar/restaurant available and it is absolutely packed with mediocre service and food! For a city this beautiful and popular the airport is a huge disappointment and aggravating. Again, absolutely no seating!

Short staffed. Incompetent baggage handling.. Flight arrived nearly on time at 10:55pm. Kept us on the tarmac for 45 min waiting for a gate when the plane occupying our gate was having mech issues and there were open gates available. Did not announce baggage carousel for 30 min.

Each gate only had 30 seats and there were 6 gates arrange in a circle around a restaurant. I stood for an hour of my 3 hour layover. I would recommend not reentering thru TSA until the last minute.

Went to Einstein Brothers picked up a drink take my meds for the next flight and a bagel. Then find out we are changing terminals and have to go through security again so purchasing an expensive airport drink only to throw it away 10 minutes later. Every major airport I have traveled through has secured connections from one terminal to another. This is totally crazy for an airport that has this mini flights. Had to turn around in the other terminal and buy another expensive airport.

2024-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,worst I've ever been to,True," First of all, this airport was absolutely packed to the gills and filthy, it was holiday travel weekend and expected to be busy. We arrived from a 5 hour flight from Hawaii with TSA precheck, already gone through the checks in Hawaii, so we had snacks and waters, not knowing we would have to exit the terminal and go back through TSA. As we approach, we are told we do have to go back through, so we queue up, and realize these people are literally stopping every single person: families with kids and tubs of vasoline, families with candles and things they purchased, myself with an unopened bottle of water I purchased in the airport after going through TSA. We all just had them throw our stuff out. The hubs are set up so that it's just a big circle with gates and one bathroom for men and one for women, so once again we queue up to go into another filthy area that clearly had not time available to clean because it was so busy. Then we couldn't find seats to wait for our flight out because there was already so little space, until the last flight left. This was the worst airport in our travel, and probably the worst one I've ever been to. La Guardia seemed like a country club in comparison.",-1,SAN

Landing in San Diego with no problem but leaving to go back home is a nightmare. The terminal is so small there are no seats much less any place to sit and eat. Only 1 shop and 1 bar/restaurant which is very very small. They really need to do something about this. Also if you have pre TSA forget it. The line was longer that regular TSA and you still have to take your shoes and off, belts, computer out of the bag and jackets. So it basically the same process and regular TSA!",-1,SAN
2022-12-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,Worst bathrooms ever,False,  Worst bathrooms ever. Urine on the floor from the time you walk in till the time you leave. Your feet stick to the floor. I watched the janitor park his cart in the bathroom then walk out. He then sat in a chair at the gate for over one hour. He then went and got his car from the restroom and left again. Never cleaning anything in the bathroom. Totally disgusting. You don't want me to post a picture of this.,-1,SAN
2022-12-02,0.1,Business,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,,4.0,One of the worst airport experiences,False,"  San Diego is the second largest city in California and has a very undersized Southwest terminals. Once through security, the gate areas are so full of waiting passengers you can barely navigate through the crowds. If you want to sit down and order food - forget it. Interested in a drink at the bar - good luck finding a wedge in the crowd to order something. And then enjoy your beverage leaned up against a wall since there is significant lack of seating. If you are Southwest passenger making a connection, be prepared to enjoy TSA security twice. The airport does not have a way for passengers who have already passed through security to get to another terminal. Passengers making a connecting flight in another terminal are forced to exit the secure area, requiring them to go back through security. This is frustrating and a waste of time. Several other passengers and I were forced to throw things away that could not go through security that we had purchased at our previous airport, on the secure side. And, as a frequent traveler, with TSA pre-check, I have never been asked to take my laptop out of my bag when going through security.

The belongings staff said cell phones did not need to be in the scanner bin. Then I got in line for the body scan and the man said I could not have my phone in the body scan. So I had to get out of body scan line and put my phone in a bin to be scanned. Dumb! The airplane was air conditioned to frigid. Why? Also, I paid $35 for a bloody mary and mimosa, which was bad enough, but included in the cost was recruitment and retention of future employees.

2022-10-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,,1.0,Unhygienic and disgusting,False,"  Arrived from San Jose at Gate 12 on the afternoon of Oct 2, 2022 and had to catch the connecting flight at Gate 10, which means exiting and reentering security. There were only two lines open, priority and the rest of us. The line was moving extremely slow and then to top that off a leak of sewer water from the ladies restroom to the right started moving toward the line. There were a couple of contract employees just standing there for about 20 minutes as the sewer water moving into the non-moving line. Finally some TSA guy comes out and moves some of barriers around to avoid having people stand and lug their bags through the sewer water. He calls on the radio on how many lanes are open (one) and asks to open another one. I suggest to him that someone shut the WATER off in the bathroom. He says that's maintenance's responsibility. 25 minutes later we get to the lane and there is another barking TSA employee (only thing they do) who yells at me for putting my glasses back in my pocket after the X-ray before he tells me to. He also barks at people for not taking their shoes off, and I mention that we've been standing in sewer water for the last 45 minutes, so maybe that's why people are hesitant to take their shoes off when now the floor leading up to the X-ray has water tracked from people standing in that water. The TSA employee is taken aback that I criticized him and I notice a sign saying you can get fined for hurting their feelings. Unhygienic and disgusting.",-1,SAN

Two complaints - the Southwest terminal is extremely crowded and it is difficult to manoeuvre through the crowds due to terminal shape. Also, I had to go through security 2x once in Denver and once in San Diego. There should be a seamless transfer system when going from one domestic flight to another - instead one has to spend an extra 20 minutes going through another security line - it seems like a waste.

The bad: since consolidating all the car rental companies in a ""rental center"" building at the south end of the runways, things have gone to hell. The shuttle service is slow, crowded and runs on no particular time schedule. There seems to be no coordination of arrivals and departures. Lines are always long. Sometimes no buses will appear for 15-20 minutes and then several may arrive all at once. The shuttle route both directions involves driving on Harbor Blvd., which at rush hours is stop & go.

TSA had only one line open and it was cramped, slow and no place to sit for more than one person at a time. Departures upstairs, loved carrying my bags upstairs. Bathrooms (men's) - small stalls with no room for bags, no hooks to hang anything, as I believe CA is in a drought I found it shameful that the automatic flush valve went off no fewer than six times while I was in there. You do know that the sensors are adjustable? Gate Seating - I was leaving from gate 12 and there was seating for about half (or less) of the passengers waiting to board.

We had plenty of room and they were obviously in a hurry trying to catch the bus. She didn’t care! I will say the driver that picked us up was very friendly and helpful. We had a 6.15 am flight so we got to rental car return at 4.05 am. The driver dropped us all off at baggage claim! Are you kidding me! Baggage claim for people leaving the rental car station and going to the airport don’t want to go to baggage claim! Who is the genius that came up with this plan? Not anyone who cares about airport patrons! The driver gives no directions about which way to go to ticketing and there are zero signs! I turn to ask the driver for assistance and she takes off! We take the stairs closest to us. When we get to the top they tell us to go back down the stairs and go right to the next stairway! We are elderly and I am disabled from injuries while serving in the military so this was not easy for us! Why can’t you drop departing passengers off at the departure gates!

So disgusted with San Diego airport. My young son and I had a late night flight and planned to rest at the airport until our early a.m. flight. Security woke us up and kicked us out at 2 am claiming they aren't a 24 hour airport. We are welcome to be on the cold, cement floor at baggage claim and have to be rechecked through security in the a.m. Are you kidding me? I've stayed overnight in airports throughout the states to catch connecting flights. They said the airlines should have told me this. Thanks for the hospitality for weary travelers. All airports should have areas where travelers can rest warmly and somewhat confortably. People can get stranded or not have the time or money to get a room and get back early, utterly ridiculous. Plus, on the other side of security you're somewhat safe, any unticketed person can sleep out here. Unless the security loudly zooming on motorized standup bikes makes things better. Can't believe how annoyed I am while they blast Christmas music and intermittent announcements bouncing off the cold tiles. (Inside the airport they didn't have the announcements).",-1,SAN

One airline three different terminals and 3 different checkpoints. Land in terminal 1, get off the plane and have to go through security to get to the terminal 2 and or 3. This airport doesn’t even have a expedited lane for transferring or connecting passenger through security. Every transferring or connecting passenger has to do a complete TSA screen before they can get to there next flight. How inconvenient is this for families with children, the elderly in wheelchairs and walkers, and for passengers who have close connections. I am all about security, keeping us safe. But let’s be honest, this isn’t about safety, it is about poor design and workflow. I personally have missed a flight do to this set up, where in any other airport this wouldn’t of been a issue.

You now clear immigration after collecting bags, mitigating any advantages of arriving in First or Business (at least on BA). Long queues at immigration. What used to take 30 minutes now takes 90 minutes. Such a waste of money and bad planning on the part of the airport. And for some reason you have to show an airport employee your passport to get into the immigration queue - creating another bottleneck. And after clearing immigration and customs you are then dumped out into a little arrivals annex far from the rest of the airport and normal terminal services - requiring a 10 min walk to the taxi or uber areas.

",True," San Diego International Airport is a perfect example of infrastructure which hasn’t kept up with community growth. The terminals are far too small for the volume of flyers passing through it, and it’s setup is a logistical nightmare. I arrived at Terminal 1 this afternoon and flew out of Gate 2. First problem I noticed was that one can only access certain gates through certain security checkpoints. Gates 1, 2, and 2A are located behind their own security checkpoint which doesn’t have TSA Pre-Check. I am a business flyer and carry an extensive amount of electronics in my baggage, all of which had to come out (in their own, separate bins) to go through the X-Ray. Also had to remove my liquids which took forever. The security line moved extremely slow due to the lack of separated TSA Pre-Check, so arrive early. Once through security, you are guided into an extremely overcrowded waiting area with very limited vendors (similar to MCI, you have to go outside of security to get something to eat). Seating is very limited and the room itself is very dirty, and the boarding posts have zero room to move around. Overall, a very unpleasant experience today.",-1,SAN

I was 2 hours early for a domestic flight and the security line was so slow that I only made it to my gate just in time for them to finish boarding. Although the staff was pleasant they were inefficient (eg, multiple staff standing around just watching a partner do something) and slow (eg, I had to stand in the scanner for 3 min, just waiting, until they finally scanned me; the bag review process was longer than other airports; employees walked and talked slowly rather than efficiently and also they were condescending asked spoke as if the passengers were 2 year olds). They have not upgraded to the latest screening procedures or machines so that took longer as well, with people being forced to do things other airports no longer require. Also when the 1st Class or TSA Pre lines were empty they were not increasing efficiency by pulling people in from Economy as they do at other airports.",-1,SAN
2018-09-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,act more like intimidating prison guards,True," San Diego “International” Airport’s Immigration Officers and Customs practices are, with very few exceptions, the worst, small-minded, parochial group of bullies I have ever experienced in all my years of international traveling. They have no idea (and they obviously don’t care) that passengers who enter using “Global Entry” have already gone through extensive background checks, finger-printing and biometric security clearances. The whole point of using Global Entry is to already answer such questions as “do you have anything to declare” via the automated kiosks and to confirm one is a trusted traveler. Yet without exception, San Diego Immigration Officers demand one hand over one’s passport and Global Entry receipt, they take an interrogative attitude, study the passport at their leisure and demand to know if one “bought anything or has anything to declare”! The whole point of answering the questions at the kiosk is so there is no need to be interviewed by an Immigration Officer! Every airport in America has fast track lanes where Global Entry passengers automatically walk right through, immigration and customs officials simply take the Global Entry receipt, no stopping, no demanding one hand over one’s passport, no questions asked. Clearly, San Diego immigration Officers do not want to accept the “fast track” part of Global Entry as a way to justify their existence to heavy-handedly screen passengers arriving on what is a minute number of daily international arrivals. Almost without exception, they act more like intimidating prison guards and management obviously allows them to act like this with impunity. This practice is unwarranted, unacceptable and completely defeats the entire purpose of the Global Entry vetting process. Another completely overreaching, baseless practice San Diego “International” Arrivals “Customs” requires is for passengers to queue up after they have passed through immigration and collected their luggage and have all their luggage x-rayed again before they can exit the airport! No other airport x-rays luggage after one arrives at ones destination! This is such typical San Diego small-minded, provincial mentality. As if pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage from international flights is less rigorous than pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage on domestic flights? How arrogant and uninformed. San Diego wants so badly to grow its international flight business, but it will never be an international airport with the immigration and customs practices they are using. With the above practices, it will remain a back-water, regional little airport staffed by amateurs who relish the idea that they are in positions of power and want to bully people. It is far better to fly out of LAX, SFO or Phoenix where the international immigration and customs teams understand their jobs.",-1,SAN

I looked at our boarding pass for the next flight and couldn’t find the gate. They do not post any directional signs which is ridiculous. We found a TSA agent for some help and we were informed that it was in another building and would have to be screened again. Couldn’t believe it! Even though we just got off a flight, we had to empty everything on the X-ray belt, including my snacks in my purse. The TSA agents were still pretty nice though so I can’t complain about them.

2017-02-13,0.7,Business,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,a more pleasant airport than many,False," San Diego airport is a nice size but a short on restaurants and other amenities and can be become congested at peak times. At Terminal 1 there are two isolated gate concourses and each only has one real restaurant. You can't get from one concourse to the other without going back through TSA. It's a poor design and gives the vendors in each concourse a monopoly. Getting to the airport can get very congested at busy times as there are some severe bottlenecks for cars, taxis, shuttles, Uber, etc. But at non-peak hours and times of year it's generally pretty good. It's not the airport's fault directly, but the surface streets around the airport are crumbling, sometimes too narrow, have pot holes that could swallow a german shepard, and make getting too and from the airport unpleasant at best. Also look for the nearby Mobile station to refuel your rental car. The closer Shell is nearly a $1/gallon more (at least in Feb 2017). It's annoying all the shuttles, taxis, rental car bus, etc pick you up and drop you off on the other side of an impenetrable fence. So you're forced to go up a long slow escalator to take a sky bridge. Many airports, even much larger ones, have crosswalks across the surface traffic to get to those areas but SAN forces you to use the awkward sky bridge. On the plus side the WiFi is free, fast, and easy to access. What few food options there are tend to be fairly decent (if typically airport expensive). They also have some decent options before passing through TSA (unlike many airports) including the Breeze and Jack In The Box at Terminal 1. And the restaurants that I've been to (including Breeze) clearly display the prices for everything including adult beverages (unlike many airports). TSA lines are generally reasonable and, even at peak times, I think I've waited at most around 15 minutes. But each TSA station serves relatively few gates which helps a lot. It's nothing like the TSA nightmare in Seattle. There's also the relatively new centralized rental car center which is a big improvement over a bunch of little off-site rental locations. The shuttle service is faster and, if for some reason, something goes wrong picking up your rental you have a dozen or so other choices in the same building. Overall SAN is a more pleasant airport than many.",1,SAN

Despite not being busy in the least, security lines were bottlenecked, disabled passengers neglected, staff frazzled and harried, all passengers treated with the minimum of civility. Most airports are significantly busier and flow more smoothly.

In San Antonio the women's bathroom in terminal B was the worst seen and the Valero Open is coming and no one at the airport cares. First stall had a bag over the toilet Second stall had a note on door does not work When my wife found one that works, there was no toilet paper, but there was plenty oall over the floor. There were four sinks, and two had bags over the faucets - not working. This is how we look to visitors! Really a poor image. This is my city, but this is not who I am.

2022-09-20,0.6,Solo Leisure,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,SAT is an overall good option,True,"  I prefer using this airport over almost any other in Texas' major cities, but, in true American airport form, there are advantages and drawbacks to using San Antonio (SAT). Here are the pros: Access from either I-410 or US 281 is pretty easy, considering that interchange is one of the busiest in the city. Access to the very busy, touristic downtown is relatively easy, as the airport isn't far away by rideshare. Parking is easy, access from the parking garages to the terminal is easy, signage leading to and within the airport is pretty easy to follow. Delta check-in was quick and friendly. Gate agents were professional and helpful. Staff in the stores generally seemed friendly. The terminal is mostly clean; the pre-security check-in area is very spacious and modern. Using CLEAR and Pre-Check, I breezed through security. However, here are the drawbacks: Security (TSA) had an officious, dour attitude that I'd expect much more in Houston, Miami, LAX, or NYC - not San Antonio. Don't know what that was about. The restrooms were filthy. Seating throughout the terminal was not at all ample for the crowds of people waiting to fly out; the airport desperately needs expansion, and that includes more seating and general modernization post-security. Upon return, baggage claim was remarkably slow for a small airport (albeit a small airport serving a large metropolitan area). So, pound for pound, SAT is an overall good option, and I'd still rather use them than anything in Houston or Austin, but there is still room for improvement.",1,SAT

After a very long day of travel from Nova Scotia I finally arrived at Savannah airport a little after midnight only to find that no Uber or Lyft rides were available and there was a very long line at the taxi stand. When I got to the window where Veronica was managing a list of ride requests, I learned that the wait was 1 to 2 hours. Empty taxi's dribbled in and veronica, always with a smile bellowed out the next name on the list is all directions. People were growing impatient with the pace and the next taxi to show up was a mini van. After exchanging a few private words with the driver, Veronica changed strategies, put her list down and bellowed anyone going to ""fill in the blank"", in my case downtown, ""hop in"". I got a ride with 2 other fares in a van after only 1/2 hr wait. Way to problem solve Veronica. Everyone wins including the taxi driver who made a few extra$$. In case anyone wants to know the issue was related to a train stopped across the main roadway access for over an hour.",1,SAV

The woman at Thrifty counter was beyond helpful she made this experience so seamless and easy. The lady at the exit point for ticket collecting was rude and unprofessional.

On arrival, I was able to exit the terminal in less than five minutes. In the arrival concourse is a staffed information booth, a shop (closed when I arrived at night) and rental car booths. Taxis waited outside, I called a Uber. Departure was likewise very easy. I printed out my boarding passes from a machine. The shop (gifts, snacks, and reading materials) was open - University of Notre Dame paraphernalia was noticeable. TSA security check was unhurried and polite. After security, there are a couple of good places to eat and drink. The bathrooms were clean. The concourse was airy with high ceiling and glass panes that allowed you to watch tarmac and runway activity. The airport is about a 15 minute drive from downtown South Bend.",1,SBN
2024-09-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,What a disappointment,False,"  First time at this airport. What a disappointment after such a great cruise vacation. Long line backed into traffic just to get to departure gates. When we tried to check our bags at the kiosk, it wouldn't work so, we waited in line 15 minutes to get assistance only to be told that Seattle doesn't allow bags to be checked more than 4 hrs before flight. What the heck!! So now we're stuck standing with 4 pcs of luggage because AA pushed our flight back by 2 hrs. No place to sit! The 3 or 4 small eateries were quickly taken up with people dragging lg suitcases who refused to give up their seat once they finished eating. The area near luggage check quickly got overcrowded with people pulling many large suitcases. To have this ""4-hr"" policy & no general seating (handicap only), makes no sense. Once we finally checked the bags & went to TSA, another nightmare. An hour + at least in line. One of the employees directing people said the reason for the madness was 2 cruise ships just disembarked with 10,000 ppl. Miami doesn't have an issue. Workers are rude & not enough body scanners. I and my carry-on went through the metal detector only to be told that because my knees set it off, I should now go to the line 4 lanes over with a full body scanner. Crazy!! Put scanners at all the TSA lanes! Once we got to our gate (escalator was broken), it was dirty, torn seats and smelled. Only 1 working bathroom in that concourse & it was nasty with no soap in any of the dispensers (women's). The air at the terminal was stagnant & warm. Due to the construction, I don't think there was any ventilation. The icing on the cake is when I overheard an annoyed pilot speaking with a flight attendant saying how much he hates flying into this airport. If you can avoid this airport, do it!",-1,SEA

Waited about 30 more minutes for bags to arrive. Arrival/pickup area outside was chaotic, traffic was 4 lanes deep, and stretched out from the terminal building. Departed on red eye Monday Morning. Kiosk check-in stations did not work, United rep confirmed they don’t work. TSA lines were very long, and TSA directions were not clearly posted or announced. There were not enough baggage totes to use for the X-ray machines. Long lines and confusing getting through TSA. Again the walk to the United gate was very long.",-1,SEA
2024-06-30,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,now rivals LAX in terms of chaos,False,"   SeaTac now rivals LAX in terms of chaos, in my opinion. We waited in a line of 100+ people for the shuttle. (After spending about 20 minutes trying to even find where to go). There was no signage and the path to get there is a construction zone right now; we had to weave around various obstacles. We got on the 4th shuttle after about 30 minutes of waiting. Then we had to wait 45 min in line to actually get the car that I had already paid for and had already pre-checked in for (well that’s Budget’s fault, not SeaTac’s). Between these issues and taxiing on the runway, I didn’t leave the airport until 3 hours after touching down. I also had a bad experience last year when flying out of SeaTac, I almost missed my flight despite arriving 90 minutes early because of their “spot saver” program. People are allowed to just cut in line for the security check. This is not the regular pre-check program, this is just people who know about the app before they arrive to the airport and can sign up to skip in line",-1,SEA
2024-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,This airport is a joke,False,"   This airport is a joke. So spread out. Poor/confusing signage. So difficult to move around the airport to gate locations. The ""train"" system is a farce. Takes so long to get between terminals. I suppose if you use the airport a lot you ""know"" the in's and out's of how it operates. If you are a first timer I am afraid it is an airport to lay down and avoid if you can. Took us 1.5 hours from time we arrived at the airport to get to the gate in the ""S"" terminal. TSA was slow, transiting inside the airport was slow. Then we missed the flight by 2 mins. That's another issue with Frontier! If you do have to use this airport I suggest you add at least 1.5 hours to what you normally expect at other airports. When we arrived it was no better. Took so long to get from the arrival gate to the off airport rental car location. The place is a mess and who ever designed it needs a head read. It's just nasty. Seems whoever owns this place is more focused on building a sprawling ediface than serving the people that use it. So sad in a first world country to have to endure a place like this.

Requests were ignored. Communication poor between agents. Travel through the airport was difficult because of the long distances with only two short people movers. Airport under construction so had to disembark to a shuttle, that broke down, then to a tram just to get to the terminal. For some needing a wheelchair, good luck; uncomfortable metal carts where the porters drop you off and left you there with no way to get around afterwards (bathroom, food, water) it took agents 30 to 45 minutes to get a wheelchair for assistance. Long long distances between bathrooms. Our ticket agent was very good trying to handle the request, just no help from other until boarding time then porter was helpful.",-1,SEA
2024-06-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,1.0,just not a good experience,False,"   Construction at the airport and it is an absolute nightmare. On my arrival it was very difficult to find the way out and there are no corresponding signs inside and outside to coordinate a meeting point. On my departure I arrived two hours before a domestic flight and missed my flight. The TSA lines were absolutely awful. There is no direction, no way to find the end of the incredibly long lines. You can pay for special lines (Clear and Pre-check) which seem to be better staffed but who knows if that would have helped. I was booked on a later flight so I stored my bags, very hard to find, another long line. The air-train into Seattle was great! Only $3 and easy to navigate. Once back for my later flight I had to wait forever to retrieve my bags and go back through security. It took almost an hour with a spot saver at a time the airport was not crowded. The closest bathrooms were closed, no bottle filler close by, just not a good experience at all. My plane was then delayed over an hour waiting for flight crew while we sat on the tarmac. In a city rich with technology, you would think the airport would be better.",-1,SEA
2024-06-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,“customer satisfaction was not a priority”,False," I recently had the misfortune of passing through Sea/Tac Airport, and I must say, it was an experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. From the moment I stepped foot inside, I was greeted with an atmosphere of disdain and hostility that permeated every corner of the terminal. The staff, if you can even call them that, were the epitome of rudeness. It was as if they had undergone special training in how to make passengers feel unwelcome and inconvenienced. Any attempt at seeking assistance was met with eye rolls, sighs of exasperation, and curt, dismissive responses. It's as if they viewed travelers not as valued customers, but as nuisances disrupting their day. The lack of basic courtesy was astonishing. It's one thing to encounter a grumpy employee here or there, but it seemed like a pervasive culture of indifference had infected the entire workforce. It was abundantly clear that customer satisfaction was not a priority for them. To add insult to injury, the facilities were woefully inadequate. Long queues snaked through the terminal, with no discernible logic or organization. Overall, my experience at Sea/Tac Airport left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. It's a shame that such a crucial hub for travel can be so poorly managed and staffed by individuals who seem to take pleasure in making passengers' lives miserable. I would advise anyone considering flying through this airport to think twice and explore alternative options if possible.",-1,SEA
2024-05-30,0.3,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,,,4.0,escorted me back to Agricultural Products,False,"   ""Welcome to the United States."" (Message to international visitors and returning residents at Seattle/Tacoma International Airport). A connecting flight in Amsterdam with a 90-minute window turned into a sprint for the gate after a backlog at Passport Control. The employees there worked hard to continue monitoring the flight departures of those waiting. The backlog was, apparently due to current U.S. mandates about rechecking all passports at certain airports, including Schiphol/Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Perhaps some European airports are more experienced in handling security and passport control. They were, after all, screening passengers more closely for nearly a half-century before American airports did more than x-ray bags and ask international passengers to declare duty items purchased overseas. We Americans did not appear very popular in the overseas airport on that day. A kind Croatian friend gave me fruit for the journey. She has never had means to travel or the luxury of wasting food, so can't comprehend the immediate confiscation of food products upon arrival in U.S. She also speaks better English than the male Passport Control official at Window 13, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, whose questions consisted of the following: (missing verbs are his, not my transcribing) ""Why you in Amsterdam? Why you in Vienna? Why you bring fruit?"" I had to repeat myself twice and raise my voice several volumes for his comprehension. He then had me escorted to the empty Agricultural Products area, where the two personnel at X-ray aisle 15 threw the produce away. When I asked if I could eat my two apples and a tangerine in their view, one said: ""This isn't a dining area."" The other said that fruits and vegetables couldn't enter the country. ""Regulations"". I believe she meant unpackaged. And, of course, they were already IN the country. And, of course, the regulations quoted state that these foods must be declared. No displayed regulation states that they must be confiscated without chance of consumption, thereby raising the chances of unpackaged food going unreported and actually moving through the country. When I retrieved some of my belongings, I told the personnel that I would know how to handle any produce in future. Both told me that my ""threat was recorded on security cameras."" Note: I had forgotten to remove the paring knife provided by my Croatian hostess, which was in my carry-on bag. It traveled through all security without incident, including the rechecks in Seattle/Tacoma International Airport. I still have it. My duty-free bag didn't exit with my other luggage. I went back for it. Two security guards' escorted me back to Agricultural Products, one checking the bag (which had already been through Passport Control with the aforementioned official at Window 13), checking receipts, asking to verify the credit card used for purchase, then escorting me out. Apparently security doubles for Agricultural Produce employees? Security guards now assume the duties of Customs officials? No one else seems to be carrying them out. What is that costing the U.S. in Customs duties? Everyone was busy with a tangerine and two apples and a duty-free bag. I sincerely thank all of the flight and gate personnel at Seattle/Tacoma International. The less said about certain Ag Produce and Passport Control personnel, the better.",-1,SEA

These lies could not be believed by even the one saying them. There is no effort to improve conditions. Driving through arrivals/departures there is no order or enforcement and it is like the wild Wild West. I don’t want to make friends with a representative or customer agent, I want to get where I am going. There is no good reason that anyone needs to arrive 3 hours before and miss a flight. The bandaid relative solution of a spot saver is the worst idea ever. 5 lines of paid or tech-savvy people all flowing through a slow process of TSA who just won’t be told what to do and won’t change because they think what they are doing is working. It isn’t. Ask anyone who has ever traveled through any other airport. Hire an outside leadership group to identify the problems, or anyone who works and lives outside of the Portland/Seattle area, get rid of the people who won’t change, and then start to get to normal.

I got back to my car after my trip and found out my car battery was dead. I went back inside the airport to find help. After like 30 minutes I found someone who was directing people to the different airlines front desks. I asked him if I could get help getting my vehicle jumped. He said no, I would have to call a tow company or AAA. That made sense because I didn't see any signs for this around. I looked in the second and 4th floors of the parking garage.

2024-01-26,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,,1.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,“avoid it like the plague” ,False," Such a dreadful experience. Long story short: DO NOT TRANSIT THROUGH THIS AIRPORT. Want details? Read on: I often travel in Africa, Europe and the USA, and I have transited through the USA- been through Denver, through JFK, through San Francisco, even Washington DC. In my 7 years of travelling across the US, never in my life have I ever faced an airport with such stupid processes, such laziness, such disorganization in my life! I booked a premium Virgin Atlantic flight to San Jose which had me transiting for the first time through Seattle. Layover time: 70 minutes on the ticket. At Heathrow, the check-in desk informed me I would need to pick up my bags then drop them off again. I thought nothing of it, thinking it would be a transit as usual. Now Virgin Atlantic even landed 25 minutes earlier, giving me 95 minutes to transit. Who created the baggage claim before passport control system? That team or person must be inhumane or just plain dumb. What happens to people who have connecting flights? It makes no sense. Took me 20 minutes to get to and claim my baggage (excellent job on Virgin Atlantic and the ground crew!) another 40 minutes through passport control, and 60 minutes through TSA. They had just one lane for hundreds of people transiting. Then after about 20 minutes someone with an iota of common sense opened another lane. Then the TSA agent opened my sealed Duty Free bag of champagne to test it, saying it flagged up on the system. After testing the glass bottle she then offered I check it in or abandon it because it could not go with me. I told her my flight left 5 minutes ago - she then had a physical malfunction. You could see it in her face. She did not know what to say. Then she had to pat me down, running through their bloody speech as you do. I was clear & vocal about my thoughts, my irritations, and my impressions of Seattle airport to any staff within earshot. That TSA agent was a robot. On the one side I felt for her, on the other I decided to put myself first too. Other passengers near me and even a couple of her colleagues were sympathetic and wondered why it needed checking when it was sealed. I should have gotten her name, but I was in a rush to get the next flight. I was not about to be stuck in this city for another moment more than necessary. My bag left with Virgin Atlantic. I missed my flight by 15 minutes. Got booked for the next flight which would have me landing in San Jose 90 minutes later than planned, and in economy. So now I have to call Virgin Atlantic for a refund of some sort and see if I can get my bottle of champagne refunded too. Now, my mind was rapidly sensitised to the mediocrity around me in that airport. When I got the boarding pass for the next flight, the agent told me to head to the gate. Finding the gate was a maze of a walk and a transit train too. When I got to the gate- I noticed the boarding pass did not have a seat number. Yeah, I had to think fast and speak to the air hostess at the counter; they had to reprint a new boarding pass! The agent did not even tell me about this. Jeez- the staff are so laid back it’s borderline unprofessional and quite frankly incompetent and inconsiderate at the barest minimum. In conclusion, if you must go through Seattle, have a layover of 4 hours at least- otherwise avoid it like the plague. This experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth. First world country my third world behind.",-1,SEA

Both my husband and I reported the unattended bag to four different United staff employees and even alerted a restaurant employee, all showed no concerns and not one person called a security person to check on the unattended bag. For all I know the bag is still sitting at gate A11. Just glad that nothing bad happened this time because as we all know TSA never misses anything in there screening process.",-1,SEA
2023-12-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,,3.0,0.0,,5.0,1.0,change to a ‘Bags first’ airport is a disaster,False,"  The change to a ‘Bags first’ airport is a disaster for any non-US citizen arriving on an international flight who hasn’t the benefit of pre-clearance at their point of departure. I arrived on the 22nd December and it took me over 2 hours from disembarking to getting outside to where a friend was collecting me. There was no obvious help for the elderly- it’s quite a trek to the escalator where you descend into the baggage hall. There was no help for anyone trying to make a connecting flight- I would never recommend that you book a connecting flight within 4 hours of arriving, and would suggest leaving it until the following day to be on the safe side. And you would have thought that at Christmas where there is a known spike in the number of people travelling that there would be more booths manned by Immigration Officials- but no that was not the case. And to have to listen to the never-ending message over the tannoy welcoming us to Seattle, was like adding insult to injury. I flew with Icelandair which I would thoroughly recommend, but for the future I’ll be flying Aer Lingus as I can pre-clear in Dublin, as I simply will not put myself through that endurance test again. It was shocking. In this day and age there must surely be a better and quicker way to screen international arrivals at SeaTac. If I had the chance I would award the Airport a Zero.",-1,SEA

SeaTac is in the top 3 worst airports. It does not handle large amounts of passengers well. It is not laid out for easy transition from ticketing to boarding. TSA screening areas are a joke. It took 45 minutes to get thru that process. They barely can handle 100 passengers not a thousand. The satellite rental car location is at least 10 minutes shuttle ride to terminal.

When one enters the terminal, at the ground level, it's not clear where to go! There is an elevator to take you to check in. Check in at American has always been good at Sea Tac. The Security lines are confusing,  very poor communication and signage at the security lines. TSA employee on 8-14-23,  around 6 pm.

The terminals can definitely use a major upgrade. As a vegetarian, I was dismayed at the limited food choices. For an airport this large, there were not many places to eat, and prices were high (menus posted outside the eateries didn't list prices). Meat-free selections were few.

I missed my flight due to the long security line, despite arriving about two hours prior to my flight. Crowded, hot, and stressful airport. I knew my flight was boarding, so I was trying to get through as fast as I could. This is after waiting nearly 1.5 hours in line. The woman in front was me left a huge gap in front of her in the baggage scanning line and was very leisurely putting stuff in the tray. I still didn't break any rules, and just reached *behind her, not encumbering her in any way, and the security guy yelled at me. No need for him to yell “HEY, she s not done.” I understand people are overworked and stressed, but there’s no reason to lose common decency, especially to people who are being polite and following rules. Don’t even know the words please or thank you. They act like prison guards. Hope I never have to go back to that hell hole.

I have honestly never hated an airport experience more; and we've had some doozies. There was a lot wrong, but I don't need to re-live the entire experience. (Shudder.) Just know that the TSA experience was absolutely grueling. To a person, each of the four or five agents we encountered as we moved through the horrific 45 minute experience was rude. They ranged from basically non-verbal with curt nodding to a woman who literally screamed at people. She spoke so rapidly no-one could understand her and when no one hopped to get the bag she was holding she screamed again She scolded customers -- some who did not speak English and had no idea what they'd done ""wrong."" I saw her slap a man's hand away when he went to retrieve his name. A supervisor was looking over her shoulder for a while and he looked angry. But he DID nothing. They were busy and probably stressed and overworked and must have decided passengers should suffer as well. That's one way they were successful. Everyone walked away shaking their head. Horrible, horrible customer service. Sometimes people can't choose which airport they must use.

Long lines and very disorganized. We pay for Clear and TSA Pre and I still got pulled out of line for the special screening which ok fine, I get that it’s random but so far this year I have been chosen on 3 out of my 4 flights. They make me and then 4 or 5 other random people wait for a good 5-10 minutes before anyone came to scan us. Why are you pulling people out of line to scan if no one is there to do it? I asked when someone was coming and was told they’ll get here when they get here. My husband told 2 women who were working behind the scanners that I needed my cane while I was standing there waiting and one rolled his eyes at him and then they both walked away. Never have we experienced such rude behavior at an airport and my husband has well over a million miles with Delta.

2023-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,5.0,1.0,Security line looked like a stirred up mess,True,"  Arrived two and a half hours prior to our flight, which was already pre processed by our cruise company, luggage done and forwarded, boarding passes given to us on board - all we had to do was arrive at the airport for an internal flight to Los Angeles, go through security and board our flight. What an absolute joke! Security line looked like a stirred up mess, but the board did say 35 mins to go through, so we didn’t really panic at that time. After trailing up, then down, then up and down, then across the bottom of a long rectangle, we thought, one more up and we’ll be at the security desk, were we heck as like - we had another three up and down and then a half line up again (the half because of a big pillar - which explained why the original up and down lines then crossed over the bottom). By this time we were around 30 minutes off our flight and we still had to go through the security checks and scanner (downright bloody lie that the board was still saying 35 mins to security - nearer 3 hours). Staff were not helpful at all except every now and then they’d barge someone to the front of the queue - for no apparent reason, either they had clearance of some sort and should have been in a different queue or their face fitted ! but it was so infuriating to watch. Any mention of missing flights due to the queues was met with selective deafness or a shrug of the shoulders. When we finally got through the scanning I asked a member of staff where our gate was and he flew his hands in the air and said “follow the signs”. Now being very close to close of boarding, even knowing which direction to look would have been helpful. Turns out following the directions was not the quickest way - there was a tram downstairs which would have saved us quite a hike. Never seen so many people running for gates in my life - obviously in the same boat as us. Our family, who live in LA, had TSA clearance and got through in about 10 minutes - I’m sure you can imagine the text messages passing between us. When we fly through Edinburgh/ London/ Manchester etc I see a pretty decent distribution of staff welcoming visitors worldwide as well as nationals with all people treated with respect. Seattle airport seemed to have an emphasis on nationals or TSA approved and very few staff attending to the general boarding line. (Most of the security screens were closed) We made our flight with minutes to spare, no time to pick up some water or a bite to eat on the plane. There were empty seats on out flight which our family found rather odd as the flight was full with a list of stand by passengers - guess those poor guys were still in the magic roundabout they call a security line - which is definitely a roundabout but there no magic in it. I will never use this airport again, which is a shame, because we had a rather nice week in Seattle before our cruise and would have considered a revisit - not going to happen I’m afraid. I have had to rate 1/10 because it won’t let me do zero and I can’t comment on airport facilities- didn’t see them as I was trying to get through to the gate before we lost our seat!",-1,SEA

2023-03-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,,4.0,,bad aspects to the design,True,"  I lived in Seattle in the past, and the airport was always small but decently serviceable, but due for an upgrade. My husband and I returned from a trip to England last week and our experience going through the touted ""brand new international arrivals terminal"" was mostly awful. It took us about an hour, and that isn't the most unreasonable amount of time, but there were some really glaringly bad aspects to the design of the place and some of their protocols that will steer me away from every flying through SeaTac again. I will say the luggage retrieval/customs/passport control/baggage redrop section was fast and efficient.  From getting off the plane and to pick up your luggage, the walk is hard to measure. I know that walked 1500 steps, about 1/4 - 1/3 mile (guesstimating based on my known ~2200 steps/mile) and it's difficult to measure the distance on a map, but it was a solid 3/4 of a mile by the time we got through the whole maze to the main terminal. There were no moving sidewalks at all, and the escalator to the top of the bridge (which allows passage of airplanes) was long and slow, as was the one on the other side. I walked down the steps and beat my husband to the bottom. After baggage/passport/customs, if you have a transfer or connecting flight, you have to get TSA'd again, full security screening, even though we hadn't even entered the main terminal yet... we were still effectively behind security. Additionally, the line was long and they only had 1 screening lane open, but did eventually open 2. This fancy new facility is not disability friendly, I'm lucky that I can walk the distances required. It just has a feel of being sparkly and over-engineered. Also, there didn't appear to be any thought for the end user in their design process.",-1,SEA

We then had to re-check our baggage which was also quick because someone pushed us through and then took us to security where they put us in the ""quick"" TSA line because they knew we had to catch a connecting flight. This is where things became abysmal. There was only one person screening IDs for everyone regardless of which line you were in. This was at 10pm. Then after that there were only 2 lanes open to screen carry-ons and people. Many people missed their flights. I ran to mine and caught it, but my daughter missed her flight. I live in AK and we have more people manning security late at night than Seattle. Not sure what their thought process is? Bottom line, get their super early.

Already aware of its reputation I tried valiantly to avoid, alas our original ticket LAX was canceled due to a late departure so we were re-routed through SeaTac. Its reputation did it justice. An underwhelming airport. Dark dirty and poorly signed. A long walk to get to cpb checkpoints and first you collect your bags. Whoever thought out that idea should be keel hauled for gross stupidity. The cbp agent was ok we were through in a few minutes and then a five-minute walk to transfer our bags. It's a hell of a long walk from one terminal to the other, you ride a very small single pod between gates assuming you can figure it out and then a long long long walk through its dirty, dark and soulless corridors up and down escalators.

Delta arrival gate involves a long walk without moving sidewalk to baggage claim. Rental car is shuttle is at the absolute end of the terminal. Bus to rental facility which has no helpful signage. On return the shuttle drops you outside of the very end on the baggage return. Up multiple stairs. Again walk the length of the terminal. If you go outside there you can find a Delta skycap.

The spot saver option is quick, available to anyone, and puts you in a short and easy line for easy security. Curbside check-in for Delta was amazing since I broke my wrist in the ice storm. And the biggest surprise was the TSA agents who tried to connect briefly with every passenger in some kind way and wished me well in my recovery, and offered assistance as needed.

There is a sense of crowding as the airport is now receiving more flights than ever before whether C or N terminal. The TSA has to check my body because I wear a medical device, but the female TSA twice were feeling right near my crotch as if they could not restrain themselves from trying to feel up there as high up my thigh as they could. My device is on my stomach, so there is no need to do a full feel over like that; no other airport did. Only this one at Sea-Tac, twice, because they also made me check in an extra carry-on-luggage. There is nothing you can do about appearance-fixated people except ignore them. If you say, ""mind your own business,"" they start shouting at you! I could have said ""mind your own business"" a few more times, but this spacy appearance-fixated gal simply would not let go. So just move away and Gosh help you that you don't encounter having to sit near these people or have them start their programmed-for-trouble staring.

2022-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,never again would we use Sea Tac,False,"  Who ever designed this airport needs to have their head examined. We arrived on an International flight. First you have to walk miles on multiple sky bridges just to get to baggage and customs/immigration. The baggage area took up most of the area. There wasn't any permanent lines set up for entering customs/immigration. Some portable lines set up on the right side of the building weaving back and forth, three deep. The end of the line went back to the stairs where you enter the area and then weaved around the different baggage claim/luggage pickup spots. Very confusing and unorganized. The only way you knew where the end of the line was there was a guy with a sign saying END OF THE LINE. Some really rude employees. I asked about passengers with short connections and was told ""We don't do short connections"" It took us 45-1 hr. just to get thru the first winding rope area to finally get to go get in line at the customs/immigration. Then off in a mad rush to get to our gate. First have to go thru security again, another 30 minutes in line. At this point we got to meet the rudest airport security person ever. He was yelling at passengers, barking orders and being verbally abusive. He was berating an elderly woman who was having problems when my husband spoke up and called him out saying, ""You don't have to talk to people like that"" We barely made it to our gate in time only to be told that the flight had been delayed. My husband and I swore never again would we use Sea Tac for an International arrival. The day after we got home we changed an up coming trip thru Sea Tac to a different airport.",-1,SEA

The delays, long lines and inefficiencies here are very discouraging. The entire place is a pig-pen, looking like there is no janitorial service at all. The floor is littered with debris, trash is left in the seats and the bathrooms are nasty. We have had many around us as we wait comment on how nasty the whole place is. This is not something that just happened today. This filth on the floor has been here for a while. Disgusting. I will avoid this airport on future travels if at all possible.

Service is horrible, security and employees are so rude and annoyed when you ask a question. Security told me the wrong direction for luggage scanning then blamed it on us, and we lost our spots in the line.

No fuss, no hassle, very little waiting, if any. It was a very efficient and well laid out airport. Now, two years later and after Covid, flights have been restored from my home city, but Seatac airport has changed, for the worse. In an effort to increase capacity of passport control, I now have to walk an uncomfortable distance from the plane to the passport control and baggage claim, and then enter a very long line-up of travellers to see an agent. Mobile passport, the version issued by the US Government, is not accepted here, the special lines for US and Canadian citizens are not being used, and if I'd had a tight connection, I would have certainly missed it. And with all the walking, it is clear that the designer did not consider older people. I don't know if I'm coming back this way, now, My recent experience was an unpleasant an trying one, at an airport I formerly considered to be the most efficient airport I had ever experienced.

Every horizontal surface needed cleaning. The restrooms are not just unclean, they rival an outhouse experience. An outhouse used by thousands of people daily. The seats are frayed and worn and literally lining the walls of the concourse where people walk by towing their luggage past your feet. The food choices remind me of a high school cafeteria ignored by the school board, overpriced and barely edible. The offerings make highway fast food seem like a gourmet alternative.

2022-01-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,isn't worth the hassle,False," Seatac has been sliding in a downward spiral for the last few years. First with their incompetent handling and management of construction/expansion that caused delays, missed flights and other problems affecting passengers from all airlines operating out of there. There has been no improvement and the construction is just dragging on now for years with little benefit seen from it. Now, the airport received a light dusting of snow that closed it down numerous times over the Christmas holidays. Canceled flights, delays compounding an already busy system, stranded passengers were the norm and it affected flights from all across the nation. But Seatac has it's cute little food delivery robots getting in passengers ways. How much did that total waste cost? Maybe if that money had been spent on a few more pieces of snow removal equipment the airport could have remained functioning. While it is not often that Seattle gets snow, it does happen regularly, even with global warming. Who ever is in charge of the airport is a total buffoon and incompetent and must be a pay back room appointee. Get someone that knows how to run a large, complicated airport system and not just some lackey looking for the splash of doing the current ""cool"" thing. I am seriously considering moving my allegiance to a different Airport, like Spokane, and if need be will be changing airlines as well. Seatac is not convenient for me at all and with all of these constant problems, it just isn't worth the hassle. I'll take my dollars elsewhere.",-1,SEA

Their N concourse has been beautifully redone, and is very modern, though the restroom wasn't very clean. Their B and C concourses, though, are still relics of the 1980s, old, cramped, vastly outdated, and with disgusting restrooms. The dining and bar options were/are plentiful, although overcrowded and overpriced even by standards of major hubs. The inter-concourse tram is nice and efficient. Customer service is about like I remember it, whether while dining in or at the boarding gate: courteous and polite, but kind of detached and aloof. I've never met any personnel in this airport who were either outright rude or outright bubbly, I guess that's just the Seattle way. Alaska and Delta have nice lounges there, and, again, the N concourse is nicely redone, so there is some incentive to transit through there more often in the future, but the airport still has a lot to be desired yet in terms of overall customer experience. If you're vacationing in the Pacific NW, I still recommend flying into Portland, Bellingham, or Vancouver, BC if you can help it.",-1,SEA

Venture to the rotunda and same, the airport is shutting down while 100s of travelers are awaiting flights.

We didn't get through security until 9.10. Our boarding pass (which we received that morning) listed the wrong gate, but since we were in a rush, we didn't stop to check it. By the time we reached the correct gate, at 9.20, we were told the doors had been closed and we missed the flight. Then we had to wait another half hour in line to get the next available flight, which was an unwelcome red-eye leaving at 9.45 pm, and our checked bag is at the wrong airport.

Seattle being such a “tech” city with so much money, one would think they could figure out how to plan a better airport. Recent multi-million dollar remodels didn’t help ...in fact I think they made it worse. Who came up with the idea to have to public transport’s last stop still be a 30 min trek to the check in counter? Is that the same person who decided to put the rental car return 2 elevators, a bus ride, and 3 escalators from the checkin desks? (Around 20 mins)  No alcohol during Covid?

Was forced to navigate across the airport (3 gates) to check by bag, and then was informed when I arrived at the gate (5 minutes before departure) that they had preemptively closed the gates 15 minutes. Didn't receive the memo. Make sure you show up at least 15 minutes prior to your scheduled departure or you may not be allowed on the plane.

I even asked an employee of the airport to enforce the rules and ask a man close to me to put on a mask and she told me it wasn’t her job and walked away.

I thought that flying in mid-May would be safer than waiting till more people flew, especially since I heard that airports and most airlines were requiring masks (if not social distancing). Only in the USA would there be no real safety regulations in place. For shame airport. Alaska Airlines was worse/as bad. They 'boasted' about their safety policy in place but it was a farce. They said masks were required but there was absolutely no enforcement, even when I complained. I hope to never fly through this airport or with this airline again. It would have been a relief if they had followed their words with real actions, but obviously they are afraid of passengers (who I agree must be not quite right to not fly with a mask), and obviously the company policy does not back them up.",-1,SEA

We arrived after a 6 hour flight to find all kitchens and quick food in this terminal closed. Even the newsstand, closes at 10. There isn’t a single thing open and after 6 hours, one might like to grab a quick bite or drink or heck, even buy a new magazine. Zero options tonight. Super unfortunate and super frustrating.

After multiple arrivals into and departures from Seattle, all I have to say is, ""What a joke!"" How, oh how, does the metropolis which gave the world Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks, and served as the setting for the classy '90s sitcom ""Frasier,"" manage to have an airport that would shame Satan himself? It's almost as bad as LAX. Staff aren't so much rude, as they are ""aggressively passive-aggressive"" - pushy and aloof, but polite the whole time they're doing it. The passengers indeed can actually seem rather hostile, perhaps because they're crammed like sardines in an old, outdated, small, dingy, filthy airport that always seems to be under construction without any tangible progress in modernization. There is no logical connectivity between the terminals, whether you're relying on signage or the inter-terminal tram. I mean, isn't the purpose of a tram to logically piece the airport together? The floors don't look like they've been cleaned since 1987. The restrooms, unkempt sometimes. Delays in arriving to, and departing from, the gate are common, because this airport has had a dramatic spike in flights without any accompanying increase in people-handling and gate capacities. If you have to visit the Pacific Northwest, fly into Portland, OR or Bellingham, WA in the US, or Victoria, BC or Vancouver, BC in Canada (though Canadian immigration and customs aren't exactly any more pleasant than their American counterparts).",-1,SEA

2020-01-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,a poor experience every time,True," The slowest and most inefficient airport I've ever had to arrive at. If you are not a US citizen, do not, I repeat, do not make a transit at this airport, you will not make it in time. Of the 6 times, I've arrived here internationally, it took an average of 1.5 hours just to clear the immigration checkpoint each time, with a maximum of 3 hours from personal experience. After clearing customs, all other airports that I've been to have your checked luggage up and out on the carousel in 20 minutes max. Here, it's at least an hour's wait so it doesn't even matter if you've cleared the immigration checkpoint quickly. Finally when you exit to ground transport, do not use the bag conveyor belt to deliver your luggage separately before taking the transit train to Seattle exit and ground transportation else you'll have to wait another 10 minutes for your bags to arrive by the conveyor belt after you've arrived by the transit train. This airport is not just understaffed, it suffers from very visible underemployment and operation inefficiencies. For example, the airport management has in their infinite wisdom decided to station not one but two workers at each luggage carousel to arrange bags neatly on the carousel as they arrive by the conveyor belt so that they don't tip over. This task is absolutely pointless - I've still seen bags tip over and being rearranged by other passengers standing beside it. So now you have two persons being paid to just stand by the carousel chit-chatting and occasionally moving a bag or two when they could be doing something more useful like delivering the bags quickly. All in all, too much waiting and a poor experience every single time. Is it too much to ask for an airport to do its job quickly so I don't have to stand for another 3 hours after a 12-hour transpacific flight? I've arrived in the US from LA and San Fran and both are much, much faster.",-1,SEA

My wife has PreCheck and has to walkway down from the rest of the security and it took her three times as long to clear bag check/body scan as I did without PreCheck. We walked down to the gate and I was shocked at the dirty carpets. All kinds of food debris are on the floor, all over. There is no one cleaning or vacuuming and it is late afternoon. My wife dropped her coat on the floor and I was grossed out. We moved to the other side of the building to wait at Gate B9 vs Gate B10. Otherwise, the experience was uneventful. Nice sunset with a good view of the mountains. Then I got my bag in San Diego and someone has been through it. It is not a TSA inspection. One side has been ransacked. The strap I always put around the bag is gone and the stupid expanding section is now bellowed out. Inside the contents are as if they were tossed in a blender. What a mess. I don't know who or why but this is really bad news. SWA runs a great organization and I doubt they were the source of something nefarious.

There was a queue to get into the queue to use the passport scanners, and then a further queue to get to an agent. The queues were “managed” by college sophomores who were all on their first week on the job. The offered no explanation as to why the delays were so extensive, and basically told the queues to shut up and endure it. It took 3 hours from the time we got in line to the 15-second interview with the immigration agent. I will never, repeat, never book an international arrival to Seattle.",-1,SEA

There are many well run airports in the country. SeaTac is not one of them. The busing to planes is a disaster. A timely departure is rare.

We were arriving from a very long flight with two small children and everything about that fact is just plain awful. There is a short walk to immigration, probably the only plus, and then the confusion begins. They won't have your stroller yet so you carry all of your luggage and small children. There is no family friendly or child friendly service. You wait in very long lines with very poor line management, changing the configuration willy nilly at will and people in the back of the line might be first ones through kind of deal. Then because their long lines are so terrible with poor customer service and direction usually your bags are out on baggage claim. Used to have to wait for that for hours but they've fixed that problem by delaying you elsewhere. Then our bag is lost and nobody knows where it is or really helps in any way. There is no convenient counter to offer assistance. Every person working there is like a free agent, not connected to the larger web. Then you wait in another line to get through baggage and when you voluntarily have one item checked out by animal control they rudely handle your stuff.  Then when you finally find someone at a baggage counter and say 'hello' they don't bother looking up from their phone to say hi back and then are just so not helpful that you decide to run screaming out of this whole place and try your luck on the phone later because humans are incompetent. Lastly forget public transportation, this is also a joke. You now have to walk like a mile to the light rail without the stroller the airport lost and then get harassed by ticket enforcement for good measure.

When your pilot wishes everyone the best of luck on arrival you know you have problems. We landed at 1:15 p.m. from Heathrow and did not get out until 4 o'clock. By that time our pick-up had left and we had to pay again. Some people had to cradle their small children for a long time as there was very little seating. I would suggest anyone thinking of arriving here on an international flight should break their journey and go through immigration, etc somewhere else and then travel on a domestic flight. We had trouble finding our bags and the airport staff, if you could find one, were unhelpful. Immigration staff were pleasant",-1,SEA

I have been in airports around the world and I can now say with confidence that SeaTac is the most poorly managed airport that I visit. I now have to account for an extra half hour (minimum) delay for both arrivals and departures. I understand growth of an area creates difficulties, but the area has experienced continuous, foreseeable growth for decades. The inability to accommodate this growth at the airport is a clear sign of poor management and this should be addressed. Top down changes are needed. Anyone in a leadership role who believes that this airport is on the right path, as busses drive people to planes, departures are delayed due to runway availability, and arrivals sit and wait for gates to open, needs to be fired and replaced by someone with a realistic view of the problems facing the airport. Solutions are needed and no new restaurant or international terminal will rectify the disaster that has become SeaTac airport.",-1,SEA

The kiosks did not print out luggage tags. This caused a long process of waiting in line to have the tags printed. Security was another nightmare, going from one security area to another depending on your gate (What? Why?). Then on top of that, some gates are in the main terminal, while others are remote, requiring a train. Mine was remote of course. The whole place is inefficient, old, and needs serious upgrading.

I have traveled to most states, and all the airports have their quirks, but this one annoyed me and that is hard to do when I am on vacation. I am not going to complain about things they have no control over like TSA lines or airline queues though their queue lines for taking passengers to the Rental Car Station was 100 yards long. I am going to complain about an unsafe practice that is directly caused by airport management. The use of buses to take passengers to their planes is something I have seen before and understand. However, filling the buses with passengers like sardines with carry on luggage is a recipe for disaster. I complained to the workers and they kept pushing people in. As I expected, the bus had to come to a hard stop (normally I would not have considered the stop as bad), and everyone wound up bumping into each other and tripping over luggage. No one was hurt but this is an accident waiting to happen. They had four buses queued up and it was unnecessary to unsafely pack this many people just because they think this is a subway car or a street bus. I choose to be on those and subject myself to that when necessary but not at an airport with carry on luggage. The other disappointing feature of the airport is its dinginess. The outside areas where you wait are poorly maintained with debris all over along with dirty walls and sidewalks. Not what I have come to expect from a US airport. I know its next to impossible to choose your airport but stay away from this one if you can until they make things safer and clean up their public areas.",-1,SEA

For years I have been traveling to and from Seatlle Tacoma, and numerous ineffective and inefficient security by DHS are implemented.

Arriving back to the same airport two weeks later, the baggage took a very long time to reach the baggage claim area. There is a totally inadequate pet relief area with a small bit of gravel, no grass. For smokers one goes outside the terminal at the baggage claim area, it is filthy and there is no cover which must be awful in the winter when it rains a lot in Seattle. To reach shuttle buses, Uber and other transportation you have to take an elevator or escalator up another level, cross a skybridge and then take another elevator down again. You cannot cross the road to reach transportation from the baggage claim area. This airport gets worse every year.",-1,SEA

Only a few check in monitors working causing approx. 1 hour lines. The dust and trash that cover the security floors is beyond sickening. The gate seats are sticky, dirty and full of trash, one even had a orange peel on the ground and no employee cared to pick it up. The bathrooms are worse than public street porta potties.

There’s absolutely no reason on a non-holiday Monday afternoon to have a 1.5 hour wait in security. The airport knows how many flights and people to expect, and they should hire enough people to facilitate people getting through security in a reasonable time. Instead, there are very few staff around to help and direct (and the ones that are just blindly tell you to go to the next checkpoint because it’s “quicker,” when it’s not). The TSA agents are rude and defensive. One was giving me a dirty look and she said because I had given her one. Well, yes, I just waited in a 1.5 hour line for no reason, did she? She then went on that it’s my fault I was late (when I arrived almost 2 hours before my domestic flight). They also flag and pull lots of luggage from the line—but then there’s no one to check that flagged luggage and you have to wait another 10 minutes while your bags just sit there.

I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people , most of whom complained to the staff on duty after an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide , with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes arrived and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine hour flight and ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own finger prints . Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints ? ….NO. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, the finger plate was dirty , greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted . So wondering what germs or micro biological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually I obtained a piece of paper with a large “X” across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again and being ordered to another queue about two and half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own finger printing machine that eventually, (although just as unclean as the previous one) agreed to read my finger tips ! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we all felt we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us in to the United States stated “We are getting new machinery soon”. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again. I found the people nasty, barking at us, talking to us like we were thick and shepherding us around like sheep.

Among our group of 6 was my 91 yr old mother who maneuvered those very very long zig zag lines thru TSA as good as we did.

They have 2 pre-check only security checkpoints right next to each other, fully staffed with officer with very little to do because they usually have just handful people in pre-check line. However, if you don’t have the pre-check, you have to walk long ways to the checkpoint in the middle of the airport, which has the line that wraps forever. It turns into a very stressful process because both the passengers and the officers are overwhelmed. Getting thru security may take you 40+ minutes. Unacceptable. This is an exptremly poorly managed TSA process and it has gotten worse in the last year.",-1,SEA

On arrival, I was shocked at how extremely long the immigration and customs queues were, staff were handing out bottles of water and many passengers were missing connecting flights. Announcements advertised an e-passport app but no WiFi on which to download the app until quite far into the queue, and no advertisement that there was WiFi. Overall, it took two hours to get through as a US citizen. After immigration (literally walking through, wondering if I was going to be arrested) I ended up confused and bewildered in Customs with people playing Human Snake around the baggage claim waiting for their turn, which took another hour. The way out was no better, with ridiculous security lines and a rush through screening that must be cutting corners. Seating before security also scarce and the cafes were crowded. Poor, retirement-age volunteers had been brought in to help queuing and give passenger info - a disgrace that they're not being paid. Come on SeaTac, get it together.

Staff at the line up area were pleasant and apologetic for the long wait. When I got to the officer, he was rude. It was a long wait for me and must be the same for him.

The staff were all very polite and helpful but that did not detract from the long 2 hour queue to get through immigration which was awful. Some people missed connections as there appeared to be no mechanism for fast tracking such passengers. Baggage was taken off the carousels long before people arrived to free up space for other flights. Then there was another queue for customs.

But I moved to Seattle some years ago, and now I’m experiencing probably the dirtiest, least efficient airport on a regular basis. Before even getting to the airport, traffic is backed up. This evening it was Arrivals traffic, but it was spilling over into the Departures lanes, so we were delayed there 15 mins. The people waiting to get to Arrivals must’ve had to wait over 30 mins to get there. They need to be better about moving people along and not letting them sit. The Security screening process is a joke, with lines going every direction and no designated person advising people how to prepare to go thru screening. The women’s bathroom was so dirty, with toilets clogged, paper towels and toilet paper all over the floor, overflowing garbage bins, soap dispensers that don’t work and if you notice the carpet at the terminal, it looks like it hasn’t been vacuumed in a week.

Not only is this airport ugly, but customer service is horrible and TSA lines are out of control. We arrived 2.5 hours prior to our flight to Las Vegas. At the airline counter we checked in and were told to wait in the TSA line which started right next to the airline counter! The line snaked around and around. It was moving so we thought the line would go quickly. We were mistaken. The lines snaked through almost every part of the terminal. Down hallways, next to shops, thru other lines, etc. I have never seen such poor management of TSA lines at any other airport in the US. It was simply mind boggling. I attempted to ask a TSA agent about the Pre-Check lines but was ignored. On my second try I was told to move or get pulled out of line. SeaTac is seriously a horrible airport. It's only redeeming quality is it's light rail system that connects directly to the airport and gets you to downtown Seattle easily. Other than that, SeaTac is a horrible mess.

I had a Pre Check so I walked right up and mentioned to an agent I needed to have a full body scan because of a knee and hip replacement. The full body scanner had yellow tape on the front of it with no agent. So he yelled something like ""where is the full body person?"" then he yelled again as I am waiting then he said ""fine I will do it"" and I finally was able to make it though no problems. My wife was not Pre Check and she waited in line for about 30 minutes until she reached the screener. They had very few agents at that time in the morning. When she went though, the machine kept saying she had something in her pant pocket. The pants did not have a pocket so they did a very detailed examination.

They had a TSA precheck with no line and many agents doing nothing while the regular line was literally out the door. Totally inefficient.

The security lines are totally ridiculous all the time. Last time I was there (June 11) at least TSA was letting people through without taking off shoes, going through the x-ray, taking out computers or toiletries, etc. which was a nice change, but even with that the line took 30 minutes and stretched for probably 200 yards away from the security checkpoint (everyone would have missed their flights if TSA had done the normal checks.) For international arrivals, passport checks can also be very slow since there doesn't seem to be any correlation between the arrival times of flights and the number of immigration officers on duty. The international departure terminal can get very crowded and hot in the early afternoon, and it can be hard to find a place to sit and slow to get served if you want food.

The announcer advised all the passengers to download the Global Passport App and complete it and as soon as we answer questions and receive the QR code we could breeze part through immigration clearance. I did this and indeed went passed through quickly only to be stopped at luggage claim and customs clearance. It was a mess! Luggage from different airlines were piled on the same luggage belts. After I found my luggage there was a long line of people trying to clear customs. It took about 2 hours to clear customer and when I asked the customs officer why there is such a back log she said the new system made it a mess.

Another chaos at the luggage belt, no discipline at all. I don't know the role played by airport staff to streamline these processes and traffic load management. Same thing happens at the boarding train point, total chaos. It's a small conveyor belt and everyone jumps on. It's like you are going to ride last scheduled train which takes you to exit doors.

In addition, they had a sarcastic tone to their verbal instructions. We had to ask for bins multipke times, especially after they continually specified that we need to empty our pockets. When my husband reached over for a bin that was being wheeled over, he was abruptly told, ""no, that's not for you, put it back"" and when another passenger reached fir a bin, he was told it would cost him $10.

After a short delay we were taken by bus to the terminal and faced a long walk up a ramp and then down hallways to clear customs and immigration. Then we discovered we had to clear security all over again and there were long lines with no Nexus available for connecting passengers. When you finally clear security again, to get to the PHX bound terminal you have to take two different trains. We just about missed the connecting flight to PHX.

When it came to bag screening, they wanted to check both my bags. The bags had the same content when I traveled here (at RDU, they never saw any reason to check it) and yet they held both the bags for additional check. I got in the line at 6.00 am for a 8.10 am flight and still couldnt make it! Most pathetic airport ever. For a holiday weekend, they had 3 agents doing the check in. At other airports at normal times there are more than 3 personnel and more on holiday times. Also they have minimal bag security lines.

Not to mention that there is a serious lack of seating. The boards that post gate numbers aren’t correct and I had a staff memeber tell me that a lot of people miss their flights because the boards aren’t updated. If you know there is an issue why not fix it instead of wasting people’s time and money? Seatac is hands down the worst airport I have ever traveled through.",-1,SEA

Check-in was nice and short. Security was horrible, it took me over an hour to get through security as they only had 2 queues open. Getting to the southern satellite was easy and fast. There was not enough seating in the terminal, many people were sitting on the floor or were forced to stand. Wifi was incredibly slow and the restaurants were way too expensive for the portions and quality of the food. Only recommending this airport because of its hub status with Alaska and Delta. Good airport if you are connecting somewhere.",1,SEA

Officers for traffic do nothing to help keep cars from slowing down drivers getting in and out of the pick-up zones. This whole process needs to be reviewed and reworked. Then the cell phone lot having to wait for traffic lights that lets only a few cars out of the lot at a time really plugged up the already horrific traffic back-up all the way from the airport to hwy 518.,-1,SEA

2017-02-14,0.1,Business,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,has outgrown itself,False," SeaTac is an embarrassment to Seattle with a monopoly. Even with PreCheck security is slow and often horribly slow for those without PreCheck. TSA sets up the security areas in very confusing and inefficient ways. Their priority seems to be how to squeeze in the longest possible lines of people rather than moving people through efficiently. SeaTac has outgrown itself. The region really needs another airport. There are often delays for take off. If you're lucky you back away from the gate on time but then either just sit somewhere on the tarmac or crawl along in a long line of planes breathing jet fumes. I've also landed many times and then had to sit waiting for a free gate. If you take anything but the light rail you're often stuck in horrible traffic congestion just getting to the airport. And it doesn't matter if you take the bus, use off-site parking, take Uber, a cab, etc. Everyone is stuck in the same mess. Around holiday peak travel times it can take 30+ minutes to travel the last mile or less to the airport. If you take the light rail to avoid the horrific traffic congestion, it's a very long, often cold or hot and sweaty walk. Most of the walk is outdoors which in a city with Seattle's weather makes no sense. And, regardless, it's a really long walk you have to account for when deciding when to arrive (or for those who can't walk long distances). During busy times the passenger arrival and drop-off areas are an absolute mess. People are parked 2 or 3 lanes deep with the cars on the inside trapped with no way out. It's likely partly so bad because the cell phone lot is often full as well. SeaTac simply doesn't have enough land to support the volume. I avoid flying with checked luggage as it's often a 30 to 45 minute wait for your bag. Sometimes it's been an hour. You ask at the baggage desk what's going on and they always say something like ""we had a shift change"" or they make some other excuse. Sometimes perhaps a third of the bags will hit the carousel then nothing for the next 15 minutes with everyone standing around complaining. You would think in a tech-heavy city like Seattle, SeaTac would offer great free WiFi right? Wrong. It's cumbersome to get access as the system first tries to sell you access. And once you do jump through all the hoops to get free access it's only good for 30 minutes and often horribly slow. There are also areas with no WiFi coverage. It's embarrassing for a tech city. SeaTac brags their shopping offers the same prices you would pay anywhere else, but that's because most of the food and shopping options are not available anywhere but in airports. So a small bottle of water is still $2.75. Prices are often not posted for beverages at restaurants or some of the shops/stands. That pint of local beer? $9.00 when it would be $5.00 or less elsewhere. The international arrivals and customs is horrible with long lines, no windows, etc. There's trash on the floor, the tables in the food court are usually gross, the restrooms have wet floors you don't want to set your bags on, and if you look along the walls and in the nooks and crannies there looks to be a months-old buildup of dirt. The cleaning staff appear to be lazy, poorly supervised, and likely understaffed.",-1,SEA

Their service is shabby, at best. They weren't very friendly and they leave you where ever they choose. The first flight through on my way to Arizona, I couldn't get any assistance at all. When I tried to ask someone pushing an empty chair around, they completely ignored me and kept going (this happened 3 times). When I went to the help desk for Alaska Airlines they were rude and told me nobody was available. On the trip back, they dropped me off at the wrong gate and then tried to put me on the wrong flight. While in Phoenix, the assistance I received was amazing. The gentleman that assisted me was extremely helpful and very nice, I left him a generous tip just because of his attitude and because of how helpful he was.

Instead, Clear employees walk their patrons to the front of TSA lines cutting in front of travelers waiting in line. This is especially problematic in the lines closest to the Clear checkpoint. Our line was stalled for at least 30 minutes while well over 30 people were allowed to cut in front of us throughout our wait. It took me a while to fathom why my line was not moving anywhere near as efficiently as other lines. Rather than spread this inconvenience equitably throughout the TSA screeners, the Clear employees used just the closest line and rarely the next few. They were rude and clearly unconcerned about the inconveniencing other travelers waiting in line. This elitism may be tolerated at Disney World but is shameful at a public airport.",-1,SFB

However, if you prefer a small regional type airport that you can pass through quickly both in and out, without stress then I strongly recommend Sanford. We now look at TUI flight options first simply because they use this airport. The staff are friendly (including immigration and security) and yet its only about 30 miles north of Orlando and roughly a 45 minute drive to the Disney resorts. We haven't been here since 2014, but I can confirm from the time we started queuing for immigration, to collecting baggage was only 25 minutes.

We were unable to get on, so my sister jumped on the elevator with him with barely any room left for her to fit, and my husband told him to wait on the second floor for us. The rest of us got on the next elevator. The young man took my mother and led my sister somewhere other than where we requested. It took us two hours to find them and the airport staff were little help. When we would ask anyone for help, they'd just quickly tell us a location and go back to what they were doing.

Even though I was able to shortcut it and asked people to let me go, when an hour was left before the flight, I couldn’t check in for my flight due to the another line. In both check out and check in areas there was lack of workers! So after I missed my flight, I got new ticket for the next day at 8:45am flight number UA5872. I had to spend more than 10 hours in San Francisco and my airline didn’t provide any accommodation or compensation. I paid from my pocket!

Perhaps these people have an inflated sense of their own importance, shouting out orders, asking questions in a suspicious tone, and not seeing the need for the most basic politenesses (no ""please"", no ""hi"", no ""thank you"", no smiles). Perhaps it would be good for their employers to remind these people that they are dealing with TRAVELERS, not PRISON INMATES. While I have noticed rudeness at other airports, San Francisco is now the winner - as the rudest airport I have encountered.",-1,SFO
2023-01-13,0.5,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,functional and clean enough,True,"  The airport itself is functional and clean enough for an American airport. The transit is a drag, especially if you're going south, but you can survive. There are some nice (even if overpriced) restaurants as well. One unexpected experience was with the Global Entry program. I had applied to it earlier in 2022 so that I could get enrollment on arrival interview. Instead, the agent told us that they were not offering any interviews at this time and that we should schedule an appointment elsewhere (they seemed to be telling the same thing to everyone else). This seems to contradict what they say on their official website (which lists SFO and no other enrollment centers in the vicinity). I understand there is a surge in applications, but it felt disingenuous for a government agency to be refusing service it is promising to deliver on their official website.",-1,SFO
2023-01-10,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,Two contrasting experiences,False,"  Two contrasting experiences within two weeks. I was a transit passenger (AKL-SFO-LHR then back again), and knowing that transit doesn't exist at most US airports in the sense that they do at most non-US international hubs, I didn't check in bags but loaded up the hand luggage instead. Thus, I didn't experience the inanity of having to get my luggage and put it back on a conveyor belt landside. On my first trip, it took 65 minutes from disembarkation to clear immigration at 6:45am in the International Terminal, G-Wing. Long queues and few immigration staff on duty. Going back through security into the same wing, the staff were poor. They were shouting at various people who had English as a second language - because that generally works - and giving instructions that contradicted the screens above their heads. (Sample screen message: 'Have your boarding pass and passport ready to show the officer.' Officer: ""Don't show me your ticket!"" Nice one, champ.) I made the mistake of having my passport in my back pocket when I was about to go through the scanner. I realised at the last second, so went to put it in the tray and got full barrels from one chap who clearly hates his job. I acknowledged my error, told him it was an oversight, that I'd just been on a 12-hour flight, and that different airports have different rules. He then started berating an elderly Indian man for putting his shoes in the tray at the wrong angle. Mate, if you do don't have patience for people, get a job where you don't have to deal with them. On the way back, totally different: eight minutes from disembarkation to clearing immigration, lots of desks open at noon, friendly and helpful staff. Within the G-wing, there's an outdoor area with not much of a view, but which affords a good burst of fresh air, which is nice when you're on a plane or in an airport for 30-odd hours. I had a 10-hour layover on the way back and liked the big chairs. Got some good sleep in them. Shops were fine: typically overpriced but it's an airport so you'd expect no less. Landside, before security, there's some pretty cool yesteryear display cabinets, showing menus and service on flights in the 70s and 80s, and some pretty interesting art / design displays too. Signage seemed straightforward enough to me. Showers / nap rooms were extortionate. You need a mortgage. In the past, I've done all I can to avoid transiting through the US. Hong Kong, Tokyo, or Singapore are much more straightforward and amenable, but when I booked the flights, HKG and Tokyo were still closed, and Singapore Airlines were a bit expensive. Nothing about SFO would make me favour it over those other three, but I'd recommend it over LAX as an international transit airport.",1,SFO
2022-11-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,improve your signage in the terminal,False,"  My 83 year old mother and I flew into SF Airport from a vacation in Puerto Vallarta, on our way home to Seattle. As it was our first port of entry we had to go through customs. Other than the rude and curt attendants organizing the lines, the customs process went pretty smoothly. Then the chaos ensued. We picked up our luggage and from there we had a very challenging time trying to figure out where to go next. There was virtually no signage about where to go or what to do. There was a baggage recheck station, staffed by a nice enough young man who had no clue where we should go or what we should do (and told us the exact opposite train to take to get to the Alaska terminal). Every person we asked gave us a different answer. We finally managed to get to the terminal that houses Alaska Airlines. We were told by one ""helpful"" airport personnel that we were already too late for our flight. We decided to try anyway. The Alaska assistance person said we had two minutes to get through TSA and board our flight to Seattle. We again decided to go for it. Luckily, I saw a fellow passenger from our first flight also in the TSA line; she said she was also on the Seattle flight and we still had a half hour. Good thing! Both my mother and I had to have every single carry on item go through the scanner twice, including removing her C-Pap, my bluetooth speaker, and my iPad. All had to go through x-ray again, separately. I was patted down. We were the very last people to get on our plane. Luckily, our luggage made it onto the plane, but my mom's suitcase never made it to the carousel in Seattle. If I could give some advice to SFO, please improve your signage in the terminal and on your shuttle train. (The train in Seattle was so clear about next stops, whereas the reader board in SFO gave zero information other than ""arriving."") Some remedial training on airport personnel might be helpful, as well.",-1,SFO

He actually took my big suitcase from me and showed me where to go to get my connecting flight. He was coming off his break. This was on Saturday 22 October around 4-5 pm.

The lighting exiting the Terminal and around check in areas is not very bright. Signage and Directions to the Air Tram to Rental Car garage were not very clear. The Air Tram service is very good. On departure from SFO the terminal was very crowded for the peak afternoon travel period. Thanks to TSA-Pre, getting through security was a breeze. The E gate concourse in Terminal 3 is gorgeous. The concourse is wide and brightly lit. The large windows bring in additional light. There is a smattering of eateries and shops. The bathrooms are very clean.

I joined the taxi line and eventually was assigned a taxi cab. The driver drove me to my hotel, Aura Hotel in San Bruno on El Camino Drive, a hotel I have stayed in many times. I believe the hotel is 1.3 miles from the airport, but this driver (Hman Taxi Service of Daly City) drove me through back roads alleys and industrial back roads to jack up his price. I remarked to him the ride was far too long and through alleys and dirt roads. He said he was following the directions from Uber! He was a crook and the meter charge was 25.50 plus a $3 tip. I could not find out what the charge should be in advance. However, my taxi ride from the hotel to the same International Terminal only cost $15! Don’t trust this company: Hman Taxi Service.",1,SFO

Walk from the gates to baggage is extremely long. If you have any mobility issues and don’t use a wheelchair, it will be a real struggle. Once you finally make it to baggage claim, you have to go back upstairs and hope you see the one small sign for rental cars. This is yet another long walk with about half of it being an uphill ramp. Then, the signs are terrible. Nothing indicated rental cars until you get to the escalators. I can’t tell you how many people I saw looking around bewildered, as well as heard complaining about the walk. Follow the signs for the AirTran and take that all the way to the end. I will never fly in or out of this airport again and willing to pick less desirable flights from Oakland or San Jose just to avoid it.",-1,SFO

If it's not the weather, it's ""runway renovations"" that cause flight delays for which apparently no one is responsible. For over 20 years, I have disliked this airport - it is dirty, with customer service representatives who apparently hate their job. It has been my only option for a specific sole airline that flies into a small airport north of SF, where my family lives. A couple years ago, I was heading to my family's hometown on a Friday for my husband's memorial service the next morning, where he had spent most of his adult life serving the public (the local service where we lived at the time of his death was for friends at our new home). Soon after my husband's death, due to shock, I had fallen down a ladder and broke my heel. For the trip, I had been recovering for 3 months and still used a cane. My flight to SF was delayed by SF due to weather - a common occurence. My connecting flight from SF to the hometown was delayed over and over on the hour. When I asked a customer service rep about this and explained that I needed to get to my husband's memorial service, he just shrugged. He had no answer whether the flight would go or not. At 11 p.m. that night, I requested wheelchair service to go to the car rental station, and the customer service rep just stared at me and acted like she didn't understand English. I went to a different desk and requested the same thing, then I rented a car to drive 5 1/2 hours to our hometown to make sure I could get to the memorial service. My understanding is that my connector flight never flew there that night. The airline carrier also did not refund me for that leg of the journey. In the most recent case this April, I recently flew the same route to visit family over spring break. On the return trip, SF delayed our takeoff for an hour, causing me to miss the last flight out of SF to my hometown. The reason -- runway renovations. By the time we arrived in SF Airport, there were no customer service reps available, no food available, and the airline customer service rep's only option was to hand me a flyer with an 800 number to reserve a hotel room ""at a discount"" for the night through Roomstorm, whereby I was charged by both Roomstorm for the very expensive hotel reservation as well as the hotel. I would not recommend this airport to anyone. I am thankful that soon the hometown airport will have a different carrier option, with direct flights to and from that completely bypass SF.",-1,SFO

We anticipated food courts may be closed and brought our dinner with us. We did take a later flight so it was not crowded at all. The only frustration I had was with long-term parking. Domestic long-term was closed with no forewarning, we were directed to international by an employee we could not understand clearly. We were given a ticket to use once we returned, I later noticed it was dated the 8th, we pulled in on the 10th.

Why charge so much, to be treated so badly because of a poor building design. If it were for better employees, better directional tools or at least some correct information instead of being told to, and I quote Delta Air Lines disgraceful employee, ""I should've read the fine print"", maybe I wouldn't be making sure I share this experience with every single option I have, so no one has to be screwed over, after all I went through to get this ticket, like I did.

TSA customs entry was very poorly stationed, as was re-entry. The food establishments in this airport remain so poor. We are currently waiting in Terminal F with music so loud that we cannot hear gate announcements sitting at our gate. Celebrating Black History Month is wonderful and appropriate.

At the time we thought this would be ample time to get through customs, pick up our bags and then recheck them in for the domestic flight and go through security again. There were three lines one for US citizens, one that said global and one that said all other passengers. We asked a staff member, which line we should get into, global or other passengers and his response was 'I can't help you.' Very unhelpful and rude. It took nearly 2 and a half hours to get through customs and we had nothing to declare. I would estimate there were about 1000 people needing to get processed and about 5 officials on duty. I felt most for the families with young children as there didn't appear to be any sympathy from the staff and everyone had to wait their turn. Some of these children had been on our flight, which was over 11 hours long. Any request such as changing a babies nappy was met with an annoyed response from staff. There were multiple people who missed flights and as expected were very distressed. When we finally got our turn we asked the guy who processed us, if it was always like this and he said it was worse in summer! If our flight hadn't been delayed 45 minutes, we would have missed it too. They really needed to have more staff on processing people.",-1,SFO

2019-12-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,SFO is a disaster,True," Nightmare in the city of SFO. On arrival no wheelchair attendant as requested. I had to push my husband in the wheelchair myself. We went through customs easily with the chair, but when we collected our luggage, I couldn’t handle the luggage and my husband. He rolled himself from the luggage to where United Air collected luggage. We then had to go through TSA again. I inquired about pre-check in TSA and the official directing people yelled at me and because of her strong accent I couldn’t understand her. When I asked her again she just got furious and turned her back on us. We ended up in the non-pre TSA which was a nightmare with all our carry ons and a wheelchair. They took the wheelchair away and made my husband go through a complete search because his arm and hip replacements set off the equipment. Finally we reached the United Gate and they were almost through boarding even though we allowed plenty of time for this transition. We were sent out in the rain to get to our plane to San Luis Obispo. Because of the weather, they needed 8 volunteers to get off the plane for weight reasons. Finally they decided to remove all the baggage so o one had to leave the plane. (Good idea). The plane took off 1.5 hours late. United Air did a good job of Tracking our luggage. It went down to LA and arrived several hours later in San Luis Obispo. When I tried to pick up my luggage in SLO, the clerk at the united counter was the rudest person and of no help. She instructed me to stand by a door and hope someone would help me. It took 20 minutes. A very nice airport employee, arriving for work took pity on me and opened the door that had the luggage. We spent 2 mos. traveling. We were in Frankfurt airport, Rome Airport, Bangkok Airport, Auckland Airport and Tahiti Airport and never had a problem.

Today we experienced the worst customer service by the TSA staff. My wife is on crutches and was forced to stand on one leg in the body scanner. I am glad this was amazing to their staff. We repeatedly ask if she could pass through the easier side in which she would be able to use her crutches, but for some reason she was denied the opportunity numerous times. However, once it was my turn to go through (noted I was only 2 people behind my wife) I was pushed to the other side of the metal detector machine instead in which we had ask for my wife to go through. Once the scanner had done its job she was expected to hop with one leg out of the machine since her crutches were being scanned. She was holding up the line, so the TSA tried to assist her by putting hands on her, but obviously my wife couldn’t take the help since she is not able to maneuver without the crutches. This was so humiliating in all aspects. TSA officers need to go through a sensitive and judgement course in which they are thought to be human beings and make better decisions. The supervisor was rude and backed her employe even though she was wrong. She continued to argue that her employee was not aware of the anxiety she was causing my wife, she had a meltdown while being patted down. Until that moment she realized she was in the wrong and contacted customer services to get my wife a wheelchair.",-1,SFO

As soon as we landed I was informed that all check-in bags would need to be picked up and rechecked, sure no problem I thought to myself because I had 2:20 min to spare. I ended up standing in the customs line for a 1:45min. I talked to 3 workers who were ""in charge of managing the lines if I could skip the line ... they said no"" I asked the customs agent if I could cut in line and he says ""sorry not our problem"" Mind you that there were only 2 agents working the whole time. So after already accepting that I missed my flight (boarding time was at 8:05), I get to the baggage area where there were no signs saying where my bag would be because it already been close to 2 hours since we landed. I find my bag thrown in a pile of other suitcases. I get to my airline desk explained the situation and they rebooked my flight .. great! But they made me go through security all over again which ended up costing me another hour to which I barely ended making my rebooked flight by 5 min! If you can avoid this airport at all costs, go to SJC or even Oakland they'll probably take better care of their passengers. It is ridiculous how we do not use computers like many European countries as customs! Very outdated methods that are broken. To make matters worse I wanted to file an actual complaint but they want you to mail it in, instead of emailing a complaint. Just shows how behind this airport is.

Never had to endure a pat down top to toe when had a handkerchief in pocket. Had to remove a plastic tooth pick! Man on moon 50 years ago but this chaos. Go to Vancouver airport.

Only a handful of lines open, with people queueing up in their socks (first time I saw a security check with mandatory shoe removal, without providing any sanitary bag to use on the extremely dirty carpet) while the luggages went through the X rays. Unlike in London Heathrow, no passport check before arriving at the gate, so make sure to call in at the check in even if you have already done it and you don't have any checked baggage to drop off, otherwise you will be called at the gate for passport check. The organization is truly terrible. Also the duty free area is pretty poor.",-1,SFO
2019-07-01,0.1,Business,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,It was a disorganized mess,False,"  Went through TSA Pre-check line at 10:30 am on a recent Sunday. The wait was over 45 minutes, and we timed people in the regular line getting through in 15 minutes on average. They kept letting all the flight crews go in front (understandable, but why not hold up the 'slow' line instead) and had only two lines open. There were no bins anywhere. If you had keys or a phone in your pocket, you were completely out of luck. My husband had a sweater they made him take off, but it got caught on the conveyor and damaged. Who has run into a baggage scanner which has no bins in use anywhere? If you have a big carry-on, you can put stuff inside - but then that, depending on your bag, means opening up your whole bag on the conveyor belt while they are yelling at you to move it along. I have knee replacements and told them, they sent me through the regular line which beeped of course, then made me go back through the body scanner line, holding others up, and then they had to do a manual search anyway. It was a disorganized mess - the worst security screening we've seen in the past year with about 60 flights in at least 24 airports. Shame on you, SFO!",-1,SFO

People were passing out, paramedics called to someone. Complete chaos. Thought perhaps it was a one off but later met someone in SF who waited for 3 and a half hours in a similar queue.

2019-05-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,,5.0,3.0,Customs was absurdly understaffed,False,"  Customs was absurdly understaffed, and it took my husband almost 2 hours to get through. Being a US citizen, I was in a different line, and got through in under a half hour. We missed our flight because of how slow this line was. It's an utter disgrace to put people through that type of wait time after traveling. There were two agents for that huge line. Even having four agents would have made a huge difference. 8 agents would have cut the wait down to just over what I had, which was plenty. After missing our flight, we spoke to a few different help desks. They were all lovely and helpful, but rather low on correct knowledge. One sent us to a travel agency pretty far away to book a new flight, and when we made it there, there was no staff. They also told us we could go to airline counters to book flights which was incorrect. The best advice the one guy gave me was to not book with cheap airlines because they provide bad/low customer service when things go awry! If you're going to fly through here be prepared for possible long customs waits, and read the info on your airlines website (for instance, that the check in desk closes an hour before the flight even though the gate is 10 minutes away!).

This is one of the better United terminals, with an interesting art exhibit in the connecting corridor between concourse F and the main terminal lobby.

Virtually NO electrical outlets available, and people laying on the floors near them trying to get a quick electrical fix. Even the United Club, their ""upscale"" lounge area, has installed USB connections that are routinely broken. Members are wandering around the lounge looking for their needed juice. ""Free Wi-fi""?

It took 90 minutes just to complete a passport check and present my declaration form. After this I needed to collect my bag and deliver it to a transfer point to have it put on the plane to Toronto. Then came the security checks. There didn't seem to be enough officers to assist with this and only one to two lines were open. The staff themselves were extremely rude yelling at us and herding us around. Have never been treated so inhumanely. My home country is Canada. I will never fly through this airport again.

San Francisco is such a beautiful city with such a worldwide publicity but it affords such a creepy airport. Let us just ignore the desolate state of the parking houses, the Bart Metro station and the highway connection and focus on the airport facilities. Information screens from 2 decades ago, slow and horrible security check and poor facilities. At least the immigration here is way much better then rest of the country. all in all - so sad!",-1,SFO
2018-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,SFO is a terrible airport,False,"  SFO is our home airport and is convenient to where we live so we choose to transit here for flights. That said, SFO is a terrible airport, and if we had a better choice we'd take it instead. Firstly the international terminal is leagues behind its counterparts in most any other city. And as we specifically travel to western Europe and the UK SFO does not compare to any of them overall. Coming back home the differences are so glaring; it's like night and day. SFO's international terminal is so tiny, post security dining is extremely poor. Not to mention expensive. They don't even have a well-stocked newsstand. Worse, however, is the TSA and immigration staff. TSA staff members can be pretty rude and abrasive especially to foreigners I'm sure. We're used to the attitude, but it makes a bad impression. Immigration is either hit or miss mostly the latter. And don't even ask about customs officials. They profile certain races which is not only archaic but unfair. How many times the immigration officials allowed us clearance only to be abruptly stopped near the exits by some Oriental customs official who thinks that because we look like them that we are lying about what we listed on our customs declaration form. We always note down everything we are bringing back & we are always within the monetary limits as well as we do not bring back contraband items. Yet these agents think they are so smart to do this profiling whilst the true perpetrators have been allowed to go. It's time to do away with this third world mentality and if they want to search then they need to do it to everyone and not just the ones they want to profile. So for everything I wish there were a way to rate SFO with minus points. Since that's not possible then a 1 is the best they deserve.",-1,SFO

One agent thought it was funny and kept laughing loudly. It made some passengers quite mad. Way to go SFO security! How to escalade a bad situation! Then they took my bag because apparently candles looks like bombs on their screen. Well by the time they looked at my bag guess what would had happened if it was something dangerous?

However I waited in the same hall for the full 90 minutes and then found out I needed another 35 minutes to collect luggage and clear security. I wasn’t the only one to miss their plane in that line.

",False,  Absolutely shambolic security lines. Priority queue (which we paid for) was significantly slower than the standard queue. Passengers had to run around fetching baskets because the staff werent bothering. Customers in wheelchairs were squeezed through the queues because no one had the foresight to put in a disabled lane.

We were finger printed twice and herded around the arrival hall like cattle. Fellow travellers missed connecting flights and airport staff were not concerned. When we finally reached the security desk the computer system crashed. Basically there was not enough staff either in the arrivals hall or on the security desks.

I was one of the last few to board (with 25 minutes to spare before takeoff) and was told by a male staff that they were out of overhead bin space for remaining passengers. I was asked “Will your bag fit under the seat in front of you?” To which I answered “Yes, it’s just clothes.” He then yelled at me and said “I didn’t ask what you had in the bag, I asked if it would fit.” This threw me off guard and I just said yes, but was fuming as I stepped away from the gate. Security was also highly stressful and chaotic, with more shouting from the TSA officers than you would expect in a local fish market. United Lounge was meh.

There was 1 duty free shop and a couple of dining options plus a couple of vending machines. No bookstore or news stand, coffee shops etc. Pre security offered better options but not by much.

There were only between 2 and 3 immigration officers on the desks with room for at least 20. This was a long haul flight and my chauffeur was also kept waiting then for 2.5 hours due to this delay.

When the flight was called it was indeed a scrum - people milling everywhere in no apparent order.

I am done with flying in and out of San Francisco because it is unreliable. Flights are delayed and often cancelled by the SFO air traffic control because the airport cannot handle the flights scheduled. If it were a weather issue I would be forgiving but it is not. My departing flight was cancelled so I had to reschedule and fly out of Oakland. When I returned my flight was delayed due to construction and one of the runways was closed. Really! You mean to tell me that with the planned construction there was no pre thought on affecting runway access. It is not just construction, with SFO there is always some excuse why a flight is delayed or cancelled. I am done! There are other choices: Oakland and now San Jose. I have been delayed and cancelled for the last time SFO. Adios!",-1,SFO
2018-07-31,0.8,Couple Leisure,5.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,,nowhere near as bad as I was expecting,True," Used San Francisco to depart on July 23. To be honest we found the airport perfectly OK (bearing in mind some of the reviews) but we only used it for departure. Travelled in by BART train from Pioneer - very easy journey even with luggage as the train terminated at International A - and about 3 minutes walk from the BA check in desks. Couldn't be easier. Checked in and got Pre TSA screened which meant through security in not much time at all. Flight was 4 hours away (the second of 2 BA flights) and flying Club Class so used the BA Lounge. The actual International Departure area after security looked quite small but it didn't have the usual hordes of people aimlessly milling about between the fast food outlets, coffee shops, sports bars and departure gates. Also quite wide so gave an airy uncrowded feel, and had some nice seating areas with tables. Probably would have been pretty dull and boring if we weren't using BA's lounge. It did have a couple of restaurants at the very end of the terminal which actually looked very nice with great views of the runways.

First the automatic scanning of passport was good and fast, but then we waited in a barely moving line as four immigration officers tried to process 1000+ incoming travelers, and proceeded to repeat what the automatic scanning device did (fingerprints and photo). Asked twice why there was such a delay, customer support replied by blaming it one the airlines 'poorly scheduled arrivals'.

I cannot even express how frustrating it is to try to log onto the WiFi upwards of 50 times and get no results. I’m leaving this airport (thank god) and won’t have to experience it any time soon. It is nearly impossible to get internet on a device that doesn’t have cellular because of this WiFi issue. I am extremely unsatisified with my departure (the wifi issue) and my arrival.

Since I traveled alone no chance to go to restrooms. When I asked someone to look after my bag for a minute to check with someone to see if there could be anything done to reach my connecting flight, all that I got was someone shouting at me from one of the officers. To picture it: Some flights had arrived in a short sequence, there must been more than 1000 people and there were 4 officers, one of them dealing exclusively with a large number of people using a wheelchair. After that he disappeared. People backed up back to the gate. So if more than 3 hours are not enough to get a connection, then I guess you cannot go through SFO at all. I made it with closing doors, sweating like hell, and wishing I hadn't booked my vacation. I booked business to have a pleasant trip, this did not work. Maybe it is some support for the airlines, so that tickets have to bought twice. So: If visitors with a willing credit card and in good spirit to use it are abosutely not welcome, why not close the border completely? Fortunately the nice people on Hawaii made more than up for it.

Queue for lift to enter departure area was also slow. Nothing to be excited about really, if given a choice, I will never fly out of this airport again. Note to all passengers - Account for a long waiting time and be very early. Airport wifi was spotty.

They seriously need to modify their immigration hall; its too small and cramped for handling so many international arrivals all the time.

Arrived on A380 flight from London at the same time as an Air France flight. 10 minute walk to passport check not too bad but that is as good as it got! Met by a very rude SFO staff member whom herded us like cattle into the international queue. It was at this point that it dawned on me I was going to be there a while ... a very long while to be precise. 10+ CBP desks all unmanned except ,yep you guessed, 1 CBP to check what I estimated to be at least 400 people in the queue. I counted probably 100 in front of me so unless they were to put more staff on (I counted at least 3 walking around chatting but not on desks) average 2-3 mins per person, I was in the queue for the long haul (pun intended!) There were families with small children in the queue some as young as 2 whose parents seemed to be at their wits end trying to keep them within the confines of the queuing system ......come on SFO airport sort it out so those with very small children and the elderly be given priority it is not on! Anyway after 2 hours in the queue and approx 40 people in front of me somebody took the initiative to open up a few more desks and some 30 mins later I received my stamp and was in the baggage hall. At least I won’t have to wait for my bag to arrive I thought - wrong it had arrived but then they had put the Air France flight on the same carousel mixing everybody’s bags up. As we had all been in immigration so long the bags had been removed from the belts and dotted around the baggage hall. Top tip if you can’t find your suitcase and are told that it has arrived ask to see if any bags had been taken downstairs to make space! As after about 50 minutes that was where I had to gamble on going (have to clear customs to go downstairs with no way back if it is not there) to visually identify it - to summarise disembark the airplane 1700 arrive immigration 1710 walk out of the airport at 2030 makes SFO officially the most disorganised airport I have ever had the displeasure to arrive sprinkle it with unmotivated rude staff really gives such a poor first impression of what is a fantastic city / country which is a shame!

It took 2 hours to get through to the domestic terminal. The security staff was indifferent and inefficient. The TSA PRE line was empty and fully staffed. The employees in that area were yawning and indifferent while there was a line of about 200 people going through the only other line. In addition, there were at least 5 other security employees standing idle. However, they chose to have only one person checking passports and only one person managing the security line who was extremely slow. It was the worst security I have ever experienced from both a domestic and international perspective. Unless I am coming to San Francisco the stay, I will try to avoid this airport in the future.",-1,SFO
2018-04-09,0.4,Family Leisure,3.0,3.0,,1.0,0.0,,,1.0,complete lack of helpers,True," Barely caught connection: signage, directions and complete lack of helpers, greeters or assistants makes navigation very challenging. Multiple possible trains to change terminals and little guidance on the quickest one. Must go through security again when transferring terminals: real downside. Also our first flight waited 25 minutes for a gate to park. Cut our time way down. I would avoid SFO Airport for connecting flights. They should work harder on user friendliness.

2018-01-12,0.4,Business,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,I try to avoid SFO,True," I fly weekly for business, and my client for the past year has been in the San Francisco Bay area - so I've flown into and out of all three Bay Area airports, Oakland, San Jose, and San Francisco. Overall, I would say that SFO has great shopping and dining, is wonderfully decorated, is convenient to drive into and out of - and totally blows at making airplanes land and take off on time. In the past year, I have had a higher percentage of my flights into and out of SFO delayed than at any other airport. When I check FlightAware, in general the other two Bay Area airports will be on-time, while SFO will be delayed. I have been delayed due to fog, winds, air traffic, runway construction and smoke. The most heinous delay was when airport operations decided to ""flip the airport"" - switch which direction traffic would land and take off - which made every airplane on the ground, even ones lined up to take off, have to then taxi around to a different runway. This happened after they closed the boarding door on my flight and put us twenty-sixth in line for take-off and delayed us for over an hour. This was one of the only two times I've ever actually missed a connecting flight. Other than SFO's near-incompetence with their core function, the airport is largely okay. I fly American from Terminal 2, but I go through security at the Delta terminal, Terminal 1, because there are currently only 8 gates in operation there, and I can go through PreCheck in less than 5 minutes, then walk over to T2 inside security. The tram that runs to the rental car facility is rather slow, but does the job fairly stress-free. And, it's fun to look at the jumbo and super-jumbo jets (Airbus 380, that is) that fly internationally. But in general, I try to avoid SFO, especially for departures if I have to make a connection.",-1,SFO

The 140+ Decibel Alarm Rang For Over 30 Minutes at 8.00 am, finally silencing around 8.30 am after the third call by airport personnel. No excuse for forcing passengers to be subjected to dangerous sound levels while staff were nowhere to be located. A complete failure to follow public health sound regulations and codes. A ridiculous amount of damage to the hearing for many. Felt like I was in a greyhound station without an adult attendant. Elderly passengers cringing with hands over ears. A major incident where no-one seems to care.",-1,SFO
2017-12-08,0.7,Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,"Overall, it's a decent airport",False,"  
SFO is my home airport. I've flown domestically a couple of times out of it, but with the lack of service on domestic airlines, I really don't like flying on US carriers. Thus, my review is a compilation of experiences on both departures and arrivals at SFO over the last six years. My wife and I travel two to three times a year, mostly to Asia to visit her relatives. Most of the TPAC flights we've taken out of SFO have been late night and the security line experience has been quite quick. SFO doesn't use TSA agents. They were allowed to hire contract employees instead and the difference shows, at least in the international security lines. I believe the longest I've taken in a security line is about 15 minutes, and that was for a rare day flight. So departures are typically pretty good. Arrivals have been a different story. We got into the Global Entry system pretty early in the game, back before credit card offers to reimburse the $100 fee were common. We did it after one particularly heinous arrival in which two 380's and a couple of 777's all landed within minutes of each other, coupled with a computer glitch, caused the lines to simply be ridiculous. If you're familiar with the arrivals layout, you know there's a gate way the heck down at the far end of the arrivals hall. That's where the back of the line was. I believe it was 2.5 hours to get through immigration after all was said and done. But even before that, lines were typically about an hour long, even when fewer than the maximum number of flights land simultaneously. Global Entry changed that for us. The last flight we took arrived back in SFO on December 5th at 6.16pm, according to FlightAware. We were in my brother-in-law's car at 6.45 with our baggage. Lounges at SFO are pretty spartan. We have the Priority Pass, and the only lounge that's available in the entire airport, domestic or international, is on the OneWorld (AA) side of international departures. None are in domestic departures. And the international departure area is separated to such an extent that if you go to the OneWorld side and your flight is departing on the Star Alliance side, you have to back out from the secure area and then pass security on the other side. Not a well thought out design. We've also used the United Lounge, and those are pretty universally grim. Signage is good. The food and beverage on the airside, while a little steep (what airport isn't), was pretty decent. While it's possible to get to and from the airport on public transit, I wouldn't recommend it. BART is a pretty poorly run system and security is not exactly their forte, so I would imagine someone with suitcases would be seen as easy pickings. My one experience with the super shuttle was a Zero Dark Thirty ride one morning from our house about 10 miles away. For my wife and I, it was about $20. Overall, it's a decent airport. It won't compare with the Changi's, Incheon's or even Bangkok airports of the world, but it's serviceable and, sadly, it represents one of the better airports in the country.",1,SFO

",False,"  Arriving into this airport was ridiculous, queues for over an hour, staff totally disrespectful and rude not only to myself but other passengers. Organised chaos, no one had a clue of what they were supposed to be doing and when they did some one else would contradict them! The young lady, I use the word lady very loosely and for the sake of this review, who pulled me to question why I didn't have my papers (another member of staff took my papers before I arrived to a member of staff who was supposed to take the papers) spoke to me like dirt and made myself and another two passengers (who I wasn't travelling with) feel very uncomfortable, very bad attitude, arrogant and curt!",-1,SFO
2017-11-16,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,,4.0,0.0,,,2.0,the worst transfer experience,False,"  This has got to be the worst transfer experience I’ve ever had. I only had a 1hr 45min layover. Make sure you have 2.5 hrs or more. The customs alone took about 45 min. I still had to claim my baggage, recheck them and go through security. I mentioned to security that I was late for my next flight and I was transferring. The guy said they don't expedite passengers (and yet many of the good reviews for their airport says they do?) so that’s a complete lie. He nicely suggested I could ask others if I could cut. Here, sadly, it’s common for people to be asking others to cut at security because they are late for their flights. To be fair, so far no staff were rude, just indifferent. But one young guy near the right side security conveyer belts (right before the scanning machine), when I asked him what should I do, grinned and rudely said ""it’s not my problem"". I didn’t have time to get his name. I had only 5 minutes to get to gate 90 (yep, the one at the very end) and had to run with all I had. Once I got to my flight 1 min past the boarding time officially ending, the crew was nice enough to still let me on. Seeing me panting, red-faced and sweating, one guy nodded at me and said “you had to run too?”",-1,SFO

In Terminal G there were no signs showing departure gates of flights leaving at other terminals. After asking cleaners and security guards we were told we would have to leave the secure area and re-enter in the other terminal. indications to find Terminal A were hard to find and we were advised to use the train. There is a blue and a red line; the red line was not operating and it was a 20 min ride from Terminal G to Terminal A, then we had to go through security which offered no help for connecting passengers, the plane was fully boarded when we arrived at the gate. We ran around 90 min and swore we will avoid SFO at all costs in the future",-1,SFO

I'm a citizen and have never waited so long for a stamp in any of the dozens of countries I've travelled - except now my own thanks to San Francisco. It was an hour in line, with equally exhausted and upset people. I looked over and saw the visitor line was 4x longer, meaning they stood for 2 or more hours for a stamp. Welcome to America? Not cool! After finally getting stamped, I was at baggage claim for an hour and a half. Some people 2 hours to get their bags, again, first time ever for me. 2.5 with no water or toilet as a single traveler you don't want to leave baggage area thinking your bag is coming out - but 1.5 hours later it finally does. I felt so embarrassed that this chaos is the very first impress for visitors and I missed 2 airport busses myself.

Things have improved markedly at San Francisco over the past couple of years. Terminal 3 has been thoroughly modernized and has many state-of-the-art features. United's clubs, at gate 69 and in the satellite concourse, are both among their better clubs. Check-in is well-spaced and efficient. Security, long a problem for Terminal 3, seems to have been configured to move quickly. We were flying at midday and experienced no wait at TSA Pre-check. As an aside, I'm also familiar with SFO's international concourses. They are among the best in the US, with lots of facilities and efficient boarding areas.",1,SFO

The ground floor baggage office, the oversize baggage office, the cleaning staff, the lost and found office and the Qantas desk. Also all the various TSA, police officers and information desk staff. All these people in one way or another were so helpful and never just told me tough luck. There was nothing of particular value in the briefcase, just a lot of items which I collected on my trip, but nevertheless I wanted to keep. It is hard to believe in such a major airport so many people would be so willing to help me. I was especially impressed with the downstairs luggage office in the international terminal who very willingly contacted a staff member who quickly checked the plane and searched it for the briefcase. The lost and found police officer did more than have me fill out a form and quickly confirmed that the briefcase had been found and returned to Qantas.",1,SFO

""Small town"" helpfulness: had a cell phone left on a plane returned to the check in desk before I got there to ask for lost and found. Nice, new departure hall and baggage claim. Very airy with lots of light. Low cost parking for friends picking me up. The minuses: The airfares! They border on extortionate. Many times cheaper to fly from MIA to Europe than to Shreveport. And UA, AA, and DL always seem to have the exact, same air fare. The local chamber of commerce should work on that. Concourses are dated. Industrial carpeting (remember that?).

Although Costa Rica is credit card friendly, we read that changing money at the airport is advisable. This was a big mistake. In comparison to the exchange rate and charges at a bank in San José city, we “lost” around 15% due to changing at the airport — this was the largest percentage we’ve lost amongst all money exchangers at an airport. For us, this was a very unpleasant experience especially for incoming new tourists.

2017-05-18,0.6,Solo Leisure,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,criminal price of food inside the terminal,False," San Jose is a small but plucky, tidy and efficient airport, marred by a couple of flaws and bottlenecks. It is modern and adequate for the passenger flow except Upon departing, the early morning flights (6 to 7.30) cause the security line to grow enormously, though it is processed in the most efficient way. While more and more airlines have switched to include the departure tax, the line can still be huge and at some points of the day it's poorly staffed. Upon arrivals, there is a critical rush hour at noon where several flights from the US, Mexico and Central America arrive at the same time, causing immigration lines up to 2 hours. Other than that, immigration is usually quick and baggage claim is very efficient (around 5-10 minutes). Customs clearance is also very quick. The other topic is the criminal price of the food inside the terminal. Costa Rica is an expensive country, but it goes to cringe worthy levels where you pay $6 for one Cinnabon roll (you pay $3 in CLT), $11-$15 for a burger with fries and refreshment. You seriously need to come with some food in your stomach (especially if you fly in the early morning flights). Another uncomfortable point is that there is no arrivals hall per se, and once you cross customs you'll be literally thrown to the street.",1,SJC

I talked to 5 different people that were working at the airport and not a single one of them could help me. The lady for lost luggage area was super rude to me and told me she could not look after any of my bags so I could go look for my boyfriend. Then I talked to a luggage guy and he literally ignored me. Then I even talked to an airport security and he could not help me either. I thought this was a tourist airport but not a single person could help me or understand me. No one would even let me use a phone they had. I think this is messed up on so many levels because I spent so much money to fly here and I got lost and not a single person could help me. Imagine a child getting lost and people just ignoring him or her because they speak english only and don’t understand them, leaving them to fend for themselves,It’s sad and a very scary thing, I am now afraid to go back to San Juan airport because of my experience and it needs to be heard and something needs to be done about it.",-1,SJU

Pero ocurrió todo lo contrario, un local de café, con precios más caros que un Starbucks, un restaurant tipo bar, en serio! Y el Viena vendiendo comidas de almuerzo, cena a las 5:30 am, en serio? No podían poner un Mesón, o hasta un McDonalds o Buerguer King, al menos esos ofrecen desayunos como Dios manda, y algo común y normal en cualquier restaurante del tamaño del LMN por todo el mundo, da vergüenza ver empanadillas, alitas, hot dogs o dulces en vez de comida verdadera de desayuno.",-1,SJU

When I got off the plane there were no wheelchairs for the three of us who requested one. We stood outside the plane for over 20 minutes. Finally when they came to get me, another lady did not have anyone to push her so an employee pushed both of us. He asked several people to help but they said they were not allowed.

Both had to leave before our plane could move to the gate. I can't believe that this airport was upgraded recently. It is a good example of how behind the US is in terms of transportation.

This alone was unusual. Then I went over to the regular TSA line guided by a TSA agent which was clearly confused by the process too, explaining that the lady directing the lines did not work for TSA, but for the Salt Lake City Airport. Then that line became congested. Curiously the other line was now going quicker? I had no less than 15 people sent in front of me. When I commented to the line director she held me back in line. That is when I finally realized what the problem was. She stated she hoped I was joking because she was handling three gates or lines. There were only two lines, the woman could not manage two lines. I think people can take turns in line without help from a power hungry, incompetent, and rude person I have come across for a long time.

As construction continues there are not enough conveyors or ways to shorten the distances. For example, to make a connecting flight on Delta to a smaller airport, they require passengers to walk through long and steeply ramped tunnels (like hamster habitrails) to span between the actual terminal and a bus stop system. Passengers must be transported to a shuttle and then let out onto the tarmac to walk up another ramp to the plane. None of these spaces are heated. People with disabilities have to find assistance, and if you can locate help, the situation is still very difficult to manage. I walked more than a mile to go from my arriving gate in the far end of Terminal A to reach the plane gated at B30. I'm a senior citizen, in very good shape, but not everyone my age can walk that far in a hurry to depart on another flight. I live in a small city 200 miles to the north and will seriously consider driving instead of taking the Habitrail route next trip. In the old days the concourse for connecting flights was E and I thought it was like a Pit of Despair as it was noisy, not nearly enough seating, and forced passengers to walk long distances. This new terminal is worse on so many levels...still not enough seating, noisy, longer distances in unheated spaces, and just because they can... Delta had us walk to the very end of the bus Habitrail, past many closer gates that were not being used. Obviously they do not care about the customers and have no respect for them.",-1,SLC

Oh and did I mention that once you get through the departure gate you will go down ramps, ride a bus and then walk on more ramps before you even get to your plane! I know it's under construction but there must be a way that is a little more convenient for the passengers! I requested wheelchair assistance but no one was around, so I started to walk and walk and walk and walk. On arrival, I finally got to the end of the B terminal and figured baggage claim would be between B and A. Oh no, now you have to walk the entire length of the A terminal to get to baggage claim. If they are going to stick with this inadequate design during construction there really needs to be a better way to move people.

Of course, there were more people, but there were many more ways he could have responded in that situation. When my baggage was checked and cleared, I had to go pick up my baggage and put on my shoes. These employees also weren't great. All they were doing was making you feel slow and stupid.

I don’t know of any airport I’ve visited that has signs declaring, “7 minute walk” ahead.

The amount of walking required to reach the B gates is absolutely ridiculous. There are a few moving sidewalks, but not nearly enough. For a person with any type of disability, it is nearly impossible to reach your gate without being utterly exhausted or without missing your flight.

Long walks, not enough gates for the planes, bus rides between plane and gates goes in circles, long gate walk in hot and covered walkways, ride bus driver, and on and on. I think you get the point that the distances are great and it makes traveling through a bit of a hassle. Will probably look for a different transfer location next time.",-1,SLC
2022-09-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,,,,"Understaffed, poor system design, very frustrating",False,"  I have never waited longer in a security line with so few people in line! There were approximately a dozen people in the TSA pre-check and CLEAR line combined. Only one official was on duty checking our IDs. There was only one of two aisles open for security screening of bags (for the TSA pre-check and CLEAR folks). It took so long to get my two bags, each in a bin, onto the conveyor belt, because, unfortunately, I was directed to the front spot, which requires a TSA attendant to stop others' bins before mine can even be put on the conveyor belt. I've been stuck in this position before at this airport, and it was impossible to get my bins on the conveyor belt without the aid of a non-existent-at-the-time attendant. This time, the attendant did stop the forward motion of the bins headed my way which allowed me to put my two bins on the conveyor belt. Next, you stand and wait for your bags to travel through, and there is this place, after screening, where each bag stops. You stare at your stopped bag, hoping it will continue forward instead of sliding to the side to go down the other conveyor which indicates that your bag has to be investigated. While standing in line, several people's bags met that fate, and you could hear a groan each time from the passenger whose bag it was. This also happened to me. It was determined that my bag ""wasn't screened properly"" and had to be sent through again! Understaffed, poor system design, very frustrating.",-1,SLC

Ample wasted space, waste of tax payers money with all the artsy nonsense that nobody cares to look at because they are worried they may not make their gate on time as they travel thru the gates of a supposed ""7 minutes walk"" of HELL to the B concourse, which of course is closer to Denver - poor planning!

If you want to get ahead of the line for a transfer flight...forget it. Unlike most of the international airports I've been too, they make you wait and pick up your checked baggage first, if your bag isn't the first one out, you get to wait in a long line for passport control. No separate line for MPC, same as Global Entry, but you are not rewarded for being ready and having it filled out beforehand on the MPC app, they just made me stand aside while the federal officer let every Global Entry person pass by me that had to fill out paperwork once they got to the terminal. So make sure your layover is long, Salt Lake Customs has no intention of making it easy or efficient from what I've seen.",-1,SLC

Arrived and departed out of Terminal B. The walk to get to and from is an absolute joke. I saw lots of older folks really struggling with the extremely long walk. Horrible design.

I am relatively fit, but not an Olympian. I would hate to transit, depart, or arrive here with a physical limitation. While others have commented on distance and time, I will say the shuttles from A to B are woeful. I passed several passengers struggling on the walk, and then found the shuttle driver at A heavily involved in his phone. Signage on the shuttle would be good. Regular departures would be good.

Designed for Olympic sprinters, not for normal humans and certainly not for anyone with the slightest disability or anyone over age 50. The walks to the gates are endless. The art work overhanging the walkway to baggage claim is grey and dirty. I understand that it’s supposed to change colors and represent our mountains.

If you are training for a marathon (and are a very patient person) this is the airport for you. How fun to hike across a tarmac, up and down exceptionally long skyways, walk around non- functioning people movers, figure out how to get on tight, crowded escalators, and walk the entire length of the complex both arriving and departing.

I had hoped that it would be one of the improvements with the billions upon billions of money taxpayers paid for the airport upgrades, but if anything it has gotten worse.

No art work, or views of area features, or even promotion of local businesses indicates the airport was built without anyone who may have been to UT prior. Can't walk around due to crowds, queues in walkways and there is nothing to look at anyway, so depressing. Super limited food options all boring and dull like the inside and outside of the airport.

Waiting in a landed plane, and it doesn’t appear to be ending anytime soon. Pilots said the tower people said we could go to perfectly open gates and just having us wait.

Getting from the furthest B gates to the exit takes nearly 15 minutes at full clip, can’t imagine what it would be like with an entire family in tow. Super disappointing, especially given how incredibly easy and fast the Salt Lake Airport used to be to navigate. Further, when waiting for a long time at B gates, there is no lounge there and not enough restaurants to pick up the volume from all the passengers. Going back to the other side is a daunting task due to the huge tunnel. Perhaps a clever redesign could make this work better, but as of today this is really a terrible airport layout.",-1,SLC

This will be all anyone will talk about if Salt Lake Wins the winter Olympics. The airport is an embarrassment. There is zero efficiency.  Nothing about this airport works as it did efficiently before. The distances between A and B terminals is ridiculous and should have a train or people mover. I could go on and on but others have done a better job lamenting this failure. I actually now hope SLC does not get the Olympics in 2030 / 2034 because it will show the world what a joke the United States is, having the worst airport in the world.  In the future I will drive from Los Angeles rather than face this horrible airport again.",-1,SLC
2022-03-10,0.1,Business,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,,,,incredibly and unexpectedly bad,False,"  It's been a few years since I used SLC. I was excited to experience the new $4.1 billion SLC. However, the experience has been incredibly and unexpectedly bad! First of all, humbly, jugging by my experience, I find it hard to believe that whomever designed the new SLC has ever been in an airport before. SLC is unbelievably the worst airport I've ever experienced in my over 1.5 million miles flown! A 25 minute power walk between security and the gates, really? The tunnel between A and B gates is too narrow for the passenger volume and out of the 3 escalators, 2 are for arriving passengers and 1 is for departing passengers. Here is a tip: It should be the other way around, departing passengers are more likely to have time constraints (such as getting to their gate so they don't miss their flight) than arriving ones. Then coming back it took SLC 1h 9 minutes to deliver my bags beating Madrid's 35 minutes and Paris CDG's little over 30 minutes. There are no seats by the baggage claim area, so plan to be standing for an hour while the bags travel from the gate to the baggage claim. -Finding your way out of the airport is challenging, especially if you're being picked up by a friend or family. I would say that the overall airport signage is the opposite of intuitive (just like in most European airports), but that's a far lesser issue given the other problems. At baggage claim I spoke with the airline staff, they were very nice and apologetic, but clearly frustrated with the airport design and management. They told me it's been like this since they've opened the new SLC in late 2020. Not sure if the SLC leadership reads these reviews or if they're even capable of realizing that maybe it's time to resign? Honestly, I've been in very poor countries and they have far better designed and run airports, costing far less than the $4.1 billion. Hope it gets better next time I use SLC, for now I'm going to avoid it as much as possible.",-1,SLC

Too bad the airport doesn't function. It's worse than Newark by a long shot. I have never received a bag in less than 30 min. Generally takes 45 min from plane door opening - even with priority status, 1+ hr wait lines to just drop off bags are common - there is only one cross between the terminals. A 15-20 min walk between security/baggage claim and your gate is common - the security tried to be modern and efficient. As a result it's a horrible system with automated trays that takes 2x longer than the normal security setup. Machines can't image 20% of bags through security and have to re scan",-1,SLC

2022-01-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,4.0,,1.0,2.0,,,,the worst airport anywhere,True," This is without any qualification the worst airport anywhere. The Delta terminal, A, is accessible from security. If you happen to fly any other airline (Southwest, United) the friendly fiends who designed the airport force you to walk at least a full mile to reach the other terminal. The cruelest joke is that even some of Delta's gates require this death march. What a shame this really is. The airport this fiasco replaced was actually one of the best airports anywhere.",-1,SLC

It was nearly a mile walk from Gate B19 to baggage claim and rental cars. They built a brand new airport and had a fresh slate to work from, but the architects and engineers absolutely dropped the ball, in my humble opinion! We will avoid this airport at all costs in the future. We saw so many elderly people resting against the wall during the ultra-long walk to/from the gate. We had our cold weather gear on and we’re sweating by the time we got to baggage claim! It’s extremely sad that so many millions of dollars were wasted on such a poorly designed facility!",-1,SLC

Upon arrival home I was told there are no carts to help to the baggage claim and a wheelchair is the only option. Wheelchair would be at least a 15 minute wait. I decided to go it on my own. The people movers are length ways apart, this surplus not elderly friendly at all. No trains, inadequate people movers and no carts to assist people.

Terminal B for anyone with a disability is over a one mile walk, require the use of an elevator and wheel chair assistance. On the return flight my son and I had to wheel my parents from check in to terminal B-they were disorganized and understaffed. We told them we were all TSA pre checked but they sent us to the wheelchair lane where we received no priority-had to remove shoes and electronics and coats. Not easy for two 87 year olds in a wheel chair. They separated us through security so my parents had to wait for my son and I to go to the back of the line instead of keeping us all together. For a State who knows how to manage its budget, this new airport represents a lack of thoughtfulness, organization and efficiency. Will find another way to get here and to avoid this airport.",-1,SLC

Having spent two nights in hotels at SLC this year because of flight delays last night was the final straw. Flying from SLC to HLN arrived SLC from ATL. Delta 3784. B Gate Sit at gate, walk down a long ramp to a bus which has 22 people on it. Board plane. After 40 mins informed heat sensor problem. I know this is a Delta problem but bear with me. After further delay informed we will sit on the plane for another hour as it “takes too long to go back to the gate.” After the hour is up informed problem cannot be fixed. Same bus back to the airport (don’t we have COVID!) wait in the airport another hour and told get back on the bus (same scenario) Board plane. Asked the flight attendant politely why they did not bring the plane to a gate and was told “if you don’t like it you can get off this plane. So much for DELTA respecting Diamond Medallion First Class passengers. Finally depart. DELTA needs to stop sending all flights from HLN to SLC. SLC cannot handle the traffic.

The signage was terrible - how do you know where you are supposed to go? The car rental was at the end (of course) and the car pickup was a further walk. The old airport was far better than the new one - how could you move backwards by spending billions of dollars on a failed experiment (linear design). I will not go thru or to your airport ever again - you make flying into Salt Lake City a disaster.,-1,SLC
2021-11-28,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,a truly awful and time-consuming experience and several levels,False,  We live in Salt Lake City and so are stuck with using this abomination of an airport. If you can avoid traveling through Salt Lake Airport you should do so - it is a truly awful and time-consuming experience and several levels. Whoever designed it should be fired and sued. What a complete waste of money it was to spend $4.1 Billion on making everything worse than the old airport. 1) Entrance is big and airy but pointlessly so - a lot of utterly wasted space with very poor signage leaving you wondering where you should go. 2) Seating stations with strange stepped horizontals which are I'm guessing are supposed to mimic rock formations but are very expensive safety risks for any children. It is only a matter of time before they get sued relating to a fall from one of those silly designs. 3) Terminal A layout - you enter at one end (rather than central) to new Terminal A. This means it is a very long walk down a bland design large corridor that goes on for seemingly miles - and that is just Terminal A. Bad luck if your gate is at the far end. 4) If you are in terminal B then even worse news - you have at least a ten to fifteen minute walk underground to get there. If you are elderly or unwell then tough luck as there is no transport system. To add insult to injury the tunnel you walk through is awful and smells stale. 5) Pick-up arrangements by private car more or less just copy the inadequate old airport model and are hopelessly inadequate. Really - no-one has given this any thought out of a $4.1Billion Budget! It is hopeless chaos at most times. Cars line up beside the road on the airport approach as there are no proper convenient waiting facilities provided and this can get quite dangerous. Someone should be held accountable for this diabolical airport design.,-1,SLC
2021-10-27,0.1,Business,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,We want the old airport back,False,"  We want the old airport back. This was a waste of tax payer money and just an excuse to build a new airport. What was wrong with the original spoke and hub design that allowed passengers to circulate through only one concourse rather than walking the length of one concourse, then through a connecting tunnel to another long concourse and then walk the length of that concourse to either get to a departure gate or arrive at a gate. I arrived at night around 9.30 when most airports are quiet but found that our aircraft had to park far out on the tarmac. The passengers had to wait and leave the plane on roll up ramps to then enter shuttle buses to go to the terminal. Only it was not to the terminal - it was to enclosed unheated temporary walkways about 1/10 of a mile long leading to the terminal. Then found that we entered the terminal at the far end of the farthest concourse and then had to walk through that concourse, thru a tunnel, and through another terminal to exit the airport.

If you fly Southwest get on your hiking shoes and plan an extra 30 minutes to get to your gate. If you fly Sky West, besides the two mile hike, it is a third world experience of long ramps and busses and always a 30 minute delay to take off. What a multi billion dollar disaster. Pickup car lines often extend to the freeway. Short term parking exit requires a multi-point turn to get out and not scratch your car. Oh how I miss the old airport. Great job SLC.",-1,SLC

They designed the walk to the B terminal to be just a few feet shy of the legal requirement to install a tram. Elderly people and people with disabilities should avoid this airport. In addition to that, there is one, I repeat, one Econ parking bus to take you to the long term lot. And more than once they have just randomly announced some spots are no longer available, it doesn’t matter if you parked there before.

Making customers walk a mile or more between gates when most people are carrying luggage or laptops is inexcusable. I visit Salt Lake for work and have not been here in the last 2 years due to the pandemic. When I came through the airport this week, I was shocked. What was once a fairly easy airport to travel through has now become an airport that I will avoid at all costs. As a regular traveler, it is clearly the worst airport in the United States.",-1,SLC
2021-10-10,0.6,Couple Leisure,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,3.0,The distances are absolutely insane,True," Overall SLC is a nice-looking airport. Very clean and bright and doesn't look outdated. Even the chairs outside the gates were a sleek design that all had functioning outlets (that we found.) The restrooms were the cleanest I've ever seen in any airport. Brightly lit, not a spot of graffiti or wear on their nice, tall, stall walls, all the chrome nicely polished, and all the soap/paper towel/faucet sensors worked flawlessly. It would probably be my favorite airport I've ever visited. Except...The distances are absolutely insane. I've read other reviews that spoke about the distances from the parking lot to rental cars/airport and I can't attest to any of those. I've never been to SLC airport besides for a transfer. But I can definitely tell you the distance from A to B concourse is long. I have mobility issues and fortunately for me, they had a wheelchair provided for me and to hold my luggage. But not so great for my companion who was walking alongside us carrying her own backpack and rolling bag. I even said to her when we finally got to our gate (at the very end of the concourse) ""Did that seem like a really long ride to you?"" She confirmed what I had suspected (completely out of breath) ""That was absolutely ridiculous. I was starting to lose you guys."" The sign as you enter the main hall connecting them even says right on it ""7 minute walk."" And that's assuming you are in relatively good shape with no physical limitations not to mention not accounting from where you came from in the previous concourse and where you have to go in the next. In our case, they both happened to be at completely opposite ends because of course they did. I would not be surprised it if was a mile of walking and possibly even more. My companion definitely got her steps in that day. It really is a nice airport overall, but God help you if you have a really tight connection.",1,SLC

Although we never experienced overcrowding or significant delays (3-4 times yearly) in the past, I will give them the benefit of the doubt regarding the need for expansion.

The employees pushing our wheelchairs were very nice, pleasant, and strong as one person pushed two of us at once! Kudos to them! But those are the only things I can think of. The negatives: way too big and impossible for anyone in their 70s or 80s to walk! I don’t know who planned this airport without any type of tram system to get one to their gate. It is literally a mile or more walk! Baggage claim is nowhere near the gates. Not enough places to get food. We have family in Utah, but this may be our last flight there.

2021-09-04,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,this is the worst airport I can think of,True," Wow. Where to start. I have over 4 million lifetime miles. I’ve traveled to 40 countries. Aside from perhaps the Berlin airport, this is the worst airport I can think of. For starters, the signage is a complete wreck. Departure gate info is so hard to see from the car rental return that I missed it not once, but twice, wandering around. Next, they have about 25 state-of-the-art check-in lines which are usually at half capacity or less. But the real kicker is that the TSA precheck line is at the very end of the line and is the old “push your bags along the steel table” throwback from 20 years ago. If that isn’t bad enough, they allow anyone (precheck or not) through this line. So the precheck line is always the longest, because there is only one, it isn’t automated, and you always have 5 people ahead of you stripping off all their clothes because they got in the wrong line and the airport is too cowardly to redirect them to one of the 12 open lanes they should be in! Complete lack of supervisory control. Then, when you get to the terminal, there is seriously almost no places to eat or shop. I don’t know how to explain it. All that space and it’s just so poorly managed. Also it’s sterile. No character (unless you want to count a few hastily drawn murals in the basement). Ok. So I haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Here we go. The walk to B gate is unbearable. 20-25 minutes and I am not joking. And most of it is in the basement. Not a pleasant walk. But then when you get to your terminal and it’s time to board, they literally ignore all priority seating benefits and let everyone rush the podium at the same time. Then they lead you down a very long ramp to the tarmac. Then you are headed into a little tin shed that is not even weatherized. If it rains you get wet. If it snows, there is snow everywhere. Then you have to board a bus (I’m not kidding) and wait there while they cram you in. Then you drive alongside the runway for quite a distance. A plane was taking off next to us and we were literally choking on Exhaust fumes. Then finally we get to our plane and basically free-for-all boarding. This airport is a $4 billion tragedy.",-1,SLC

I cannot tell you how disappointed, disturbed and even mad I felt after walking for what seemed like miles to finally get to my ride waiting outside. Salt Lake planners—what were you thinking? This airport is the least customer friendly I can remember. In most of the place, the vibe inside is cold, unfriendly and impersonal. I can’t rate airport staff because I didn’t see any. I am nearing 70 and although I was able to make it around the place, my dreams of traveling more now that we are retired may require some rethinking. I don’t know how much longer I will be able to handle the marathon walks from terminal to terminal, etc.. I feel extremely sorry for older travelers, for those in wheelchairs or mobility challenged, as well as parents dealing with young children and lots of luggage. There are no trams at all, no moving vehicles for those with mobility issues, and totally inadequate/unclear signage. How sad and tragic. I, frankly, felt embarrassed by this disaster. Other than the bathrooms, which were nice, everything else is a big fail! I never thought I would say this, but I really miss the old airport! Granted, it wasn’t perfect, but I would take it any day over this costly boondogle. What a shameful waste of taxpayer dollars. It makes me want to sue the architect. I wish we could raze the place and start over.",-1,SLC

But if I ever go through SLC airport again I'll be wearing mine for the 5K ahead of me to get to the B gates. Wow! Who designed this catastrophe of an airport? I am a Denver resident and travel frequently for business. It looks to me as if they wanted to pattern this airport after DIA, but without trains or sufficient moving walkways. On my visit two of the moving walkways were inoperable, which seems almost criminal. I personally witnessed two elderly people taking breaks against the wall red-faced and breathing heavily. I truly hope someone sues this airport authority if a heart attack or other exercise-induced medical incident occurs. The airport should come with a warning, like an aerobics class you might sign up for - ""must be physically fit and have a doctor's permission to fly through SLC airport.""",-1,SLC

The airport is huge with very long walking times to B gates which my past 3 flights have been out of. TSA takes much longer due to a weird setup of agents spaced out and requiring time after the previous person has finished, to get to them. I had to park my car to assist my 11 year old granddaughter to get on her flight and was in the airport 2 hours and 8 minutes. This cost me a grand total of $15. I'm beginning to completely hate flying. The hidden charges for everything, snacks, drinks, carry-ons, seats! Give me a road trip any day, even with high gas prices.",-1,SLC

I have a bad knee, so I'm not the fastest, but wasn't the slowest either. This is a long way from an improvement. No way will I be flying into or out of SLC or Southwest ever again. Airport has lots of big windows and some artwork, but when I go to the airport its not to look out the window or check out artwork.

2021-08-08,0.2,Business,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,anyone who thought opening the airport in this state is negligent,False,"  A couple of prefaces. I’m in decent physical shape, I’m not Prefontaine (I picked a distance runner for a reason), but do work out 5-6 days a week. Also pre-Covid, I did a lot of business travel, 200K a year, and actually tried to go through SLC if an east-west layover was required, because it was a much more pleasant experience than Denver or Dallas. SLC was a great midsize airport. What happened? I’m seriously gobsmacked how thoroughly botched this new one is. I mean it’s clean and looks nice, but it’s a functional disaster that must have been designed by a walking fetishist. I saw a different review comparing this airport to Incheon and Hong Kong, which makes me think they’ve never been to those airports, because both have trams that get you close to where you need to go, have centralized shopping, lounges and food options, and have shapes not inspired by a giant equals sign. It’s like the designers looked at Detroit and Atlanta, and said, “That, but without the trains!” My personal story, discovering that my favorite east-west hub had been brutalized, was a on this most recent connection, my first trip since Covid. The plane parked away from the terminals next to a ramp, where a bus would get us. Not ideal, but whatever, I have been to airports under construction and this happens. We deplaned, and got on the bus. On arrival to the terminal, things started to unravel. You arrive to a structure that looks like a shrine to the world’s longest ramps that's connected to the end of Terminal B. When you get on this thing and look up, it’s almost comical how long and skinny it is. It’s no joke probably two hundred yards long, and a wheelchair wide. I don’t know how this thing is legal for either fire or ADA, because getting a wheelchair up this thing would be brutal, and if there’s a fire, there’s no escape. When I finished my climb, I then did what I always do, find the lounge. I used up about 20 minutes of my 90 minute layover with the bus and ramp, but still thought I had time to grab some breakfast. This turned out to be about as naive as thinking you can win a land war in Asia. I was at one end of Terminal B, and my connection was on the other end of Terminal B. I figured the lounge would be central like they usually are. Really should have looked at a map. I saw signage, and began to walk, and walk. Got to the opening to the tunnel to Terminal A, the signage indicated the lounge was on the other side, and I figured it must be central in Terminal A near the tunnel, so still doable. Ten minutes and a broken conveyor later, I get to Terminal A, and start following signage. Walking and walking. At this point I’m angry and committed. Turns out the lounge is at the very end of Terminal A, making it effectively useless for 3/4 of connecting traffic. I arrived 25 minutes after finishing the ramp hike, and scanned in for essentially a water break before my return journey to the connection that I now knew was a mile away. I arrived to my connection sweating through my shirt and angry, with my phone congratulating me for power walking nearly three miles. I understand this airport is a work in progress, but anyone who thought opening the airport in this state is negligent. I don’t know how anyone with mobility issues or children could do it without severe distress. Considering the money involved, it’s borderline criminal.",-1,SLC

You should hang your architect - every visitor that goes to SLC will judge you by this terrible design! Unless your arrive gate is A terminal at SLC, you should train several weeks of cardio for this airport. I arrived on C gate - the plane parks on the tarmac and a bus picks you up 3rd world nation style. Then you see dropped off at the bottom of a ADA ramp that is 200 yds long and on only 1 person wide, so forget about getting past a slow person. Then you find yourself at the very end of B terminal. Then you walk 1/2 mile to the end of B terminal. Then the 1/3 mile walk under the tarmac. Then you find yourself at the far end of A terminal. Another 1/2 mile walk and and you end up at passenger pick up and arrival- which actually was vastly improved. Note to SLC Olympic Committee - don't take the inspectors to B gate!",-1,SLC

The old airport was better from a passenger perspective in every conceivable way. The old airport was smaller and never built to exist in the current airport climate, yet it worked, and it had character and was a pleasant space. It never felt overly crowded even on busy days and with small concourses. Now the new airport 'feels' packed and its 5x larger. Everyone is channeled into the same spaces. Nobody likes walking in tunnels - in the hold airport you had to walk distances between concourses but they were pleasant walks with views. Now you know you are walking in a basement. I could go on and on and on - but it suffices to say the design is poor, the capacity feels *reduced* versus the old one, and its as cold and sterile a design that feels unpleasant to spend time there. There is nothing 'warm' in this design, it is like spending time in a hospital, how nice! Everything that everyone else says about it is true. It is a complete bomb. Avoid traveling here or connecting through here.",-1,SLC

Very few restaurants with long lines, which makes one wonder what purpose a Lego store is there for, for instance. The number of restaurants per given space less than any major US airport I have been. Others have commented on long walks. Although I agree there are long distances between moving walkways, those passengers have clearly never been to Minneapolis. In the lobby, the plastic white blobs are incredibly ugly. I don’t even know their purpose. Are they sculptures or seats? No one was sitting on them in any case. Arrival and departure areas much improved, and they are now up to standard of every major US airports.

2021-07-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,Extremely disorganized border control,False,"  Extremely disorganized border control. There's a dozen different lanes and none of them line up with the actual desks to go up to, and the person in charge of directing traffic was totally lost. Most of the global entry machines weren't working. I waited in line for 90 minutes at a brand new airport which only had a single half-full international flight arriving at that time. Once you clear customs, they don't have a dedicated security spot set up (they do but its all blocked off), so you have to exit the security area and re-enter in the main terminal with everyone else. For a brand new airport design that's completely unacceptable. Finally, the design is just an extremely long terminal building (think San Jose on steroids). There are huge gaps between the moving walkways, and the signage is really unclear if you're trying to get to B-gates. Overall it's very new/shiny but absolutely horrendous for a traveler in terms of usefulness.",-1,SLC
2021-07-25,0.2,Family Leisure,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,extremely disappointed with the new airport,False,"  We have been extremely disappointed with the new airport. Most of airport gates are a huge trek from security and also to baggage claim. They need a tram or similar system considering how spread out everything is and how crowded it is (think DFW). The lines for the food places are consistently far too long now. The LED screens for baggage claim is too small and seem to be located only in one spot. All flights funnel through one security line that can be massively long if you don’t have TSA or Clear! The lines to get on the parking lot shuttle are often very long, too. We miss the airport and it’s ease of use that existed prior to this expansion. Please improve this airport!!!",-1,SLC

How terribly disappointed we are - as are most of our fellow Utahns who fly much. Whoever designed this airport should be fired/sued for a truly awful job - it is unbelievably passenger unfriendly. 1) Ridiculous walk times and distances from Terminal B. 2) Vast areas of wasted space. 3) Terrible seating design in dangerous ladder type format. 4) Hopelessly inadequate drop-off and pick-up facilities - probably worse than the old airport. 5) Food and refreshment facilities are lacking.

I get the linear design concept what the distances are incredibly long with very poor passenger transportation, except for a few sparse and slow moving walkways. Detroit, perhaps the best example of linear design, has a tram system. SLC has nothing. Also, there is only one Delta sky club and it is located at the farthest point from all gates. Long tunnel, long concourses, 30 minute walk (no exaggeration) and then a bus to the plane. This SLC is perhaps the poorest airport design in all of my extensive travel experience and certainly not what you would expect from a “new” airport. It’s about as traveler unfriendly as could be conceived.",-1,SLC
2021-07-08,0.1,Family Leisure,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,it's laughable how poorly it is designed,True," If it was your goal in life to make the worst airport possible, you would fail, because there is no way you could make it worse than this new multi-billion dollar airport. It's almost like they took everything good about the last airport (and there was a lot of good) and tried to do the opposite. Starting with something the old airport struggled with, pickup and drop-off. The old airport was almost always packed and difficult to deal with, so what was their solution? Make less space to pickup and drop-off...brilliant!! Off to a great start! Now let's take something the old airport did well and completely butcher it. You had very little distance to walk with the old airport because you had two terminals with separate security lines (three if you count the international terminal, it was a genius layout). This new airport has one security line and then once you're in the terminal, you start all the way at the end of a quarter mile (at least) corridor. Then if you want to get to the next terminal, you have to walk halfway down the first, then another 1/8th of a mile under the tarmac, then walk all the way down to wherever your gate is. I mean, it's laughable how poorly it is designed. Especially given that most people in Utah have a ton of kids. I only have two (very) young kids and it is a nightmare to get luggage and kids from the drop off area all the way to the gate. We were lucky enough to have another couple help us each time we've done it. The brain power and decision making that went into this new airport is embarrassing. At least look at what works at other airports and copy that if you can't come up with a better idea. I can only think of one nice thing to say about this new airport, it looks nice.",-1,SLC

SLC started with a clean slate and created one of the most boring vanilla airports in the world. The development maybe had the best intentions, but not only did they miss the mark, SLC is a poorly designed airport, boring & one could not make it more vanilla if they tried. I travel a lot & I have been to tiny airports that had more character. It works, it is an airport, long walks, which is ok, but not for the elders at all. Plain strait line & not much to brag about here at all. Horrible selection of stores, boring, not enough restaurants and just so, so. Catch your flight or arrive. That is all one can say.

I've been in small to mega airports all over the country and the world and SLC takes the prize for the slowest, most inefficient, and horrendously long walking distances. I can't express what a super disappointment this place is, and I know of no other passengers who've been through it, who do not feel the same way. I mean seriously! Did the designers not look at any other airports to see what's working? Dumb, dumb, dumb. You'd think that for the billions that it's costing, we would have gotten something better than this disaster.",-1,SLC

This is a total disaster, I missed my first flight with seven people by 15 minutes prior to departure posted time, it was horrible we even had a pilot with us that could not make his connection. This flight was from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City with connecting flight to Phoenix. I had to wait in the airport with the group for five hours until the next flight at 11.30pm. The pilot went on with another airline, he had to reach the airport in Phoenix to fly the same plane to its next flight. On my return flight from Arizona to Idaho I jogged from concourse to concourse almost missing the flight from Salt Lake City to Idaho. They were shutting the door on the bus transportation. The escalator from floor to floor was so crowded that each step had someone with luggage on it and it was not a safe looking environment. The walkways were extremely crowded and people were bypassing them running alongside it very un safe conditions. I wanted so bad to take a picture of this but could not stop it was so chaotic crowded. Both Concourses are extremely narrow with people running and tripping over each other. Whoever was on the planning committee of this-airport will Airport did a disservice to Salt Lake City. If you have any handicap or age related walking or traveling issues stay clear of this airport it is not conducive to getting you around in these long distances. Sorry Salt Lake but I will do everything I can to avoid layovers or connecting flights with you from now on I was so excited to see the new terminals.",-1,SLC

Just avoid this airport unless it is a connection. After screening it took the geniuses at TSA 45 minutes to figure out that three hats will not be recognized as an approved object on the scanner. These chuckleheads will pull your contents from one bin and not tell you. Seriously watch your stuff and pay attention. If you are not on gates A1 to A20 be prepared to trek over to the B concourse and wear your hiking boots. I think the local government dropped about $4B on this disaster. The rental car area is onsite and is pretty straightforward to return a car.,-1,SLC
2021-06-23,0.4,Couple Leisure,1.0,5.0,,5.0,0.0,,,,unfortunately I am very disappointed with it,False,"  It looks like this is a very new wing of the airport in SLC and unfortunately I am very disappointed with it. Nothing has changed for the better. There are seats everywhere and no standing areas or places to stand and do work, charge phones, etc. We sit in cramped little seats on airplanes - why would we want more sitting time while in the airport too? I don’t ever want to sit more while in the airport - I either want to stand or to sleep. So where are the airport beds for everyone who is exhausted from not being able to sleep on planes? or the standing areas to do work? Where is the progress? Furthermore, there should be compost stations around the airport - not just trash and recycling. We should be much more progressive these days - especially in places where thousands of people visit every day. Definitely things to think about and changes to make now.",-1,SLC

Check in on 3rd floor then walk down to 2nd where you wait in a security line that regularly backs up into baggage claim. The automated security can probably be fixed, but right now it doesn't work nor has it since the airport opened. Once you do get through security, there is a long walk if you are at any but the first few a gates. I fly through here regularly and don't have too much issue with domestic arrivals. I experienced my first international arrival today and have to ask who approved grabbing luggage before checking passports? All of these people could be getting processed while the baggage makes the trek across the airport, now people have to line up for baggage, then go through customs...also, there will be people lining up with oversized baggage in the tight customs line. The engineering on this project is probably the worst I've ever seen.",-1,SLC

The distance required to walk to B gates is absurd, together with a departure arrival that requires you to take an escalator up and then down to check in and access gate levels. All total passengers must endure four escalators — long ones — if going to B gates. This shows that either the architects were newbies incapable of good design, or that the City did not listen and fund properly — or both. SLC is a lesson in terrible airport planning where whomever led the work should forever be banned from any large scale public project, especially any involving public transportation.",-1,SLC

I have regularly traveled to SLC over 55 years but will no longer do so because there is an utter lack of assistance for those who are physically disabled. I was forced to walk well over 1 mile to baggage claim and then the vehicle rental area because of a lack of wheelchair or electric cart assistance. And I had ordered this assistance in advance. I was told to ""wait"". After 30 minutes, the wheelchair never arrived and there was no United Airlines employee at the gate to check on the status of the wheelchair while I waited. Needless to say, the walk not only caused me pain, but also exacerbated my injuries. Further, I was almost knocked down twice by people running to catch connecting flights because they were not allowed sufficient time to cover the 1 mile walk in a safe manner. In the future I will fly to Boise, St. George, Las Vegas or other locations which do not connect to SLC and then drive to SLC if I have to go there in order to avoid the airport. But otherwise, I'm now staying away from Salt Lake for vacations and will avoid it as much as I can for business purposes.",-1,SLC

The poor signage has still not improved despite numerous complaints. The wheelchair transport is a joke and virtually nonexistent unless it's between 8.00-4.00, Monday through Friday (and forget it if you dare fly on a holiday!). The bottleneck at TSA is a new twist which usually wasn't a problem before. One of the most egregious hallmarks of this billion dollar monstrosity is no train and/or shuttle. The walking sidewalks (if working) move pathetically slow. The elderly, the disabled, the unconditioned are forced to walk 1+ miles to terminal B. The response to these complaints from the paying public is signage ""distracts from the beauty of the building"", ""wheelchair transport should be arranged through the airline by you"", ""TSA is being thorough"", ""we don't have a shuttle due to too many accidents"", ""there is a train scheduled to be up and running in 2024"".

Who ever approved the blueprints of this new terminal needs to be kicked in the rear end! You have to go to the third floor to check in then you have to go back down to the second floor for security. Seems like a waste of time and could be very confusing for some people. And why is it so humid in here?

It is legitimately >1 mile walk from getting dropped off at the curb, go through security, and make it to the middle B gates. I'm not saying they don't have carts for the elderly or disabled to be shuttled, but I didn't see one over the course of my 20 minute walk from security to my gate. There needs to be a subway/rail system set up to accommodate travelers better. They do have moving floors in the tunnel, but there are gaps that don't have the floor. Not sure why anyone would want to get off the floor midway through a tunnel that has no services or even a bench to sit on. At minimum they should have installed two floors for each direction and have them run the entire length. Restaurants and shops are sparse in the B terminal. Giving the new design a 2/10 only because it has new paint. There's not much else that was done right with this one.",-1,SLC

Along that line, those responsible for approving the idiotic design, must be held accountable as well. I've traveled around the world on business and pleasure for 40 years and never have I witnessed such ineptitude in moving people through an airport, especially one that was built in the 21st century, as the mishmash known as SLC. Twenty to thirty minute walks are great, except when traveling through an airport, but that is what the geniuses responsible for this design came up with. I suppose it didn't dawn on them the elderly, or those with ambulatory issues, may have to use this facility. Designing from scratch, with no restrictions of trying to fit a new facility within the confines of an existing airport, and this joke of an airport is what nearly $5B got the traveling public using Delta's hub in Salt Lake City.",-1,SLC

Our plane sat on the tarma longer than it should have before letting us disembark therefore we had limited time to get from place to place. Signs were not placed well to direct which way to go to B terminal and the walk was horrendous. The mass of people walking through the airport was unbelievable and although moving sidewalks were offered, with people not moving over to allow the folks that need to get somewhere to get there.

SLC used to be a great place to transfer with immediate access to the terminal via a short concourse upon deplaning. Now for the smaller flights you get dropped off on the tarmac where a shuttle specific to that flight awaits the plane. The worst part is that that shuttle will not leave the location until every last passenger, crew member and checked carry-on luggage has been piled into the shuttle. Expect an extra 20 minutes at least until you get to the terminal. I now avoid SLC at all costs and drive a bit to other airports that don't force an SLC stop, but unfortunately I'm captive many times and there are no other solutions. If you're picking up luggage in SLC from one of the smaller planes, it could be an hour from landing. It's a shame that what was once a great airport has been redesigned with such little concern to user experience.",-1,SLC

The airport is so spread out with no access to a tram or shuttle within the terminals. We walked from our Southwest Terminal to the baggage claim then to the rental car area. The moving escalators are available but so very slow to navigate (it really just provides a place to rest while you move at a snails pace) and we walked and walked to get to the baggage claim area. It was at least 30 minutes and both of us have bad knees. What a poorly thought out airport. There should be shuttles in the terminals for people who need some assistance. Even my friends who live in SLC remark about how poorly this expansion is designed when you have to retrieve baggage. After this experience this last Wednesday we are going to cut our vacation short and come back halfway from Yellowstone to SLC so we have enough time to navigate. Beware - besides the poorly designed baggage claim area - the rental car area is even farther. If you are going to rent from an offsite company it is poorly marked about where to pick up your shuttle. I am in airports every week - poor poor design. Get those shuttles running to assist people who need it.,-1,SLC

I was looking forward to the new Salt Lake City airport after all of the publicity touting that it would be one of the most spectacular airports in the country. What a disappointment! I don’t think the passenger experience was even considered. They amount of walking involved adds an extra 20 to 30 minutes to reach the gate. Even worse than that is there are few resources to help those who have physical issues. There is no seating on the long Aulson non functioning walkways and few carts to give people a ride. The wonderful restaurants that many of us had come to appreciate at the old airport are gone. I have to fly in and out of the airport frequently and each time I’m there I am profoundly surprised and disappointed at the layout of the airport which in actuality does not offer more gates than the old airport. I have written in voice my concerns and has been told that I am in the minority and that most people are quite happy with the airport.",-1,SLC

I think reviews have been altered so that the public thinks this new airport is a good thing. In reality, it is the most poorly designed airport I have traveled through anywhere (and I travel a good deal). There is no thought to customer convenience or time and ease of getting from one point to another. I had to walk over a quarter mile from my parking shuttle drop, through the parking garage across a skywalk to check my bag on a different level. Had to go to another level to get to security. 1.2 mile walk to get to Southwest terminal after going through security. No bus or train option. No seating in thoroughfare if you must stop. You have to find an open seat at a gate amidst those waiting to board a flight. No Smartcarts except in parking garage at $6 fee. When returning to SLC, baggage claim sign hardly visible as it has same size small letters as Delta lounge and ground transportation and is listed with those items even though baggage claim is the main thing people look for when getting off the plane. When you finally get to baggage claim, there are no benches or seats. The seats are in one place past baggage claim. I don't know why anyone would even use them there, makes no sense! Terrible, inconvenient, difficult to navigate airport. Every business associate and personal guest has complained to me about it. I am ashamed it is our only option.",-1,SLC

Everything about it is awful - they’ve crammed all arrivals and departures through a single limited space - so drop off and pick up is a mess. The have 2 concourses connected by an underground corridor which you have to walk - assume an extra half hour. They demolished the old terminals and don’t have enough gates - so planes park on the tarmac and they bus you to the farthest possible point from baggage claim. I’ve been to third-world countries with better airports. And the thing is it’s brand new - spent $1b - who are the nitwits who thought of this? I’d recommend skipping SLC and vacation elsewhere until they slap some fixes on this - a real solution is years away.,-1,SLC

We arrived by taxi about 1.5 hours before the departure time. The first oddity is that you enter on level 1, go to level 3 to drop off baggage and get boarding passes, then go down to level 2 to access the gates. A bit strange, but not a deal breaker. On level 2 there is a single TSA check point. The line had to be at least a 1/4 mile long. We had first class tickets, but did not see the priority boarding entry until we were nearly thru the general boarding line. We had the misfortune of departing from Terminal B. It took us at least 1/2 hour to walk there. I do not think we ever had a longer walk to a departure gate.",-1,SLC

He doesn't want to fly anymore because of it and now after the other day when I flew out and back in on the same day, I see why. Horrible is the best way to describe it. I am glad it was just me flying and not my child. I thought the long walk was done after the security point but man was I wrong. It then starts a long walk down a hall, then down an escalator, then down a long hall, then up an escalator, then down a long hall till it breaks up into 2 halls to gates. So ridiculous. I am seriously considering never using SLC airport again. I would rather drive 12 hours to my destination then walk that ever again. Just getting to baggage claim is a nightmare and then figuring out how to get outside to get picked up, a whole new nightmare. I don't mind walking, even though medically it is hard for me right now and I did it but that was the most ridiculous thing ever. I left mad.",-1,SLC

I've listened and talked to airline personnel, strangers, and friends about how painful it is to walk such long distances and the limited food/drink options.

2021-04-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,the least friendly airport,False,"  This airport is a disaster! This was the least friendly airport for its patrons that I have ever been in, and I have traveled a lot. I was excited to try out the new airport since I'd heard so many things about how streamlined and efficient it would be. That is absolutely not the case. When we first departed from the airport, I was very disappointed with how humongous it is, with no concessions for people to move through it easily (except a few slow moving walkways). It is so large it's difficult to get from one place to another, and it takes forever to get anywhere. It seems as if you're walking for miles before you get to your destination, and the signage is not clear, you're not sure where to go. It was a disappointing experience. However, our return experience was even worse! We are 65 and 70 years old. Although we're on the older side, we're in pretty good shape, having just returned from a dive trip. After traveling all day and being worn out from travel, we thought we were going to die of exhaustion before we got out of there. I'm sure we must have walked over two miles just to get out! I have a bad right hip which is usually manageable, but after walking and walking and walking, and walking some more, I thought I was going to die before I got out of there. There are no accommodations for those with health difficulties - how did they ever pass ADA regulations? I didn't see one vehicle that could move elderly or disabled people from one place to another. The design is horrendous - it is so spread out, it's definitely not conducive to anyone that has difficulties ambulating. There is no tram system, as is used in most other airports to move people from one section of the airport to another. Although there is a place for a future tram, it needs to be put in place immediately, not years down the road. And, the way it's laid out, I'm not sure it will decrease the walk time for the patrons. Who designed this thing, and did the city actually sign off on the design? Did they not care about whether it was doable for its patrons? Obviously, no one thought about those that cannot easily walk several miles. And, they have cast the parking shuttles into outer darkness, probably to benefit themselves and their own parking garage. After picking up baggage, you used to be able to walk out the door and pick up the parking shuttles. Now, after walking through the whole airport, you then have to walk another half mile to get to the outside rim of the parking lot to a small designated spot for the parking shuttles. It appears they're trying to drive them out of business and inconvenience their customers! It is really a travesty!

I have been flying out of the old airport for more than 15 years 2 times per month or more. It was amazing, easy and efficient. My colleagues loved coming to see us in SLC and always complemented us on our easy our airport was to navigate. We went from my No. 1 most favorite airport to the absolute worst airport in the whole world. Of course it looks nice and is clean, it's new. However they will never be able to fix the design of this airport and the amount of time it adds to my regular travel plans. It will take me 30 minutes just to walk from terminal B through terminal A out of the building and all the way back around to catch the train. I used to be able to walk off the train and onto my flight in 20 minutes, that includes going through security. Anytime you have to post walk times, you failed. I seriously want the tax money back that paid for this. I just cant tell you how mad I am that this is my home airport. Airlines! Please start trying to add flights in Provo!

2021-04-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,,,,A total and utter disaster,False,  A total and utter disaster. The people who designed the new SLC airport should have to spend every work day walking the miles and miles of corridors to go from plane to baggage claim or from entry to gate. It’s simply too much walking. I don’t know how anyone with a disability or anyone elderly can deal with this place. Are we not wanted in Salt Lake City? How on earth did it pass ADA regulations? Not only are distances a problem but checking in on one floor then having to go to another to get to security and the gates makes absolutely no sense. It may be more efficient for the planes but it’s hellacious for the flying public. Can’t understand how such a project could be so badly botched.,-1,SLC
2021-04-12,0.3,Solo Leisure,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,how is this even legal,False,"  In an age of project planning, focus groups, and ADA, how is this even legal. Appalling. When I got on the departing flight, a young guy said to the person sitting next to him, ""How many times do you think we've heard the word 'ridiculous' in the last 45 minutes?"" I like to walk, and I didn't have a bag, so my concerns are for those with heavy backpacks, small children, the aged, the unfit, and those on tight schedules. I pity anyone who has more than one of those factors. After a shocking experience departing the airport, I decided to start my pedometer on the airplane when arriving at gate B8, which is not the most distant gate. You could very easily add another .25 miles to the number I'm about to share if you had a B25 gate, or similar. I started my pedometer when I got off the plane to see how far it was to the long-term parking shuttles. It clocked in right at .75 miles. (So if you had a B25 gate, for example, it would be over a mile, I think.) A few other factors to into it to make it better and worse than it sounds. 1) I didn't use any of the moving walkways last night, one of which wasn't working, anyway (at a brand new airport - it had an out of order sign). I did that for two reasons: to measure and also because no one stays to the right on the walkways so you can pass, because they're all so tired of walking. That means that the moving walkways actually slow down the sense of progress you feel you're making on the sojourn. 2) On the escalators, no one walks them, either (for the same reason), so you just have to stand there. Standing actually tires me more, and it's a little frustrating if you're in a hurry. The escalators serve a necessary purpose, though - you probably wouldn't want to opt for the stairs (stair steps, by the way, would add to the length I tracked). You're going under the tarmac above you, and the escalators cover a pretty significant drop and climb. Again, the escalator (and moving sidewalk) could either give you a sense of rest or drive you crazy because they poke along and no one moves on them. If you're in a hurry, you're pretty stuck or you'll need to break a sweat and do the stairs twice (down and up on the other side). 3) There was not a long TSA line, but the wait was still lengthy. The tray system is now automated, but it doesn't speed things up. I think it slows it down. Back in the day, a human being could remove trays and take them back to the front, now they have to be left on the belt to be collected at the end, and the belt isn't very long and there's no place but at the belt to pull your stuff off (often to put it on again). The way they file the people through and screen the trays, the trays and people conning through aren't in the same order--not even close to it (which has always been the case to some degree, but it is way worse now). So TSA will either give you the impression of being able to take a breather or it will ultimately add to the length of your airport marathon. A few other random gripes are that even that strange, white fabric wave art installation (which didn't appear to be working) is an extension of the utter lack of practical planning this entire airport disaster represents. The airport is barely six months old, and it already looks dingy from airplane exhaust. Whoever thought that was a good idea? I remember the lack of cleanability was something observers talked about from day one. The added time makes driving to surrounding states seem better.",-1,SLC

To begin, I absolutely do not understand the onslaught of negative reviews for the newly-completed (and still under-construction) SLC redo. The only explanation I can think of is that those negative reviews are from people driving in from some place like Magna, West Valley, Brigham City, or Wendover who just don't like big cities and big changes. Let me start with the positives of the new SLC, and there are many: 1) TSA staff who are helpful, polite, and explanatory, who don't bark orders officiously, and who efficiently process passengers. The best TSA I've encountered in almost any airport in the USA, except possibly some small airports like Lexington. 2) Architecturally stunning, post-contemporary, and a generally relaxing, open-air design; the closest thing I've seen in the USA to a Seoul Incheon, Hong Kong, and Sydney's Kingsford Smith (though those airports are even more beautiful). 3) Countless art displays in the terminal, completed concourses, and the underground walkway connecting the concourses at present. 4) Dining and shopping options in the Delta concourse (A). 5) Ample displays and signage, from the time you leave I-80 or North Temple to the time you arrive at your gate. 6) Luggage carts prominently located at the entry to the terminal (although you have to pay for them, and I don't like that we have to do that at US airports in general when you don't always have to in other countries). 7) Accessibility by highway, TRAX light rail, or rideshare is a breeze. 8) It's close to downtown, and still a 45-minute drive from Park City, Antelope Island, etc. 9) The restrooms (men's anyway) have stalls which afford full privacy, common in western Europe and wealthier Asian countries but rare in the US. Now, there are some drawbacks that will need to be worked out: 1) There really needs to be significantly improved accessibility between the terminal, baggage claim and concourses, hopefully the new tunnel under construction will remedy that, but there is no excuse for this airport to not already have an active tram. However, despite the naysayers' reviews, it takes 15 minutes to walk across the airport, not 30 minutes. 2) The food and dining options in concourse B (Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc.) could stand to be more numerous. I'll also say that while Uinta Brewing is a great place for a locally-brewed beer, they could stand some competition, as the service frankly wasn't very attentive or friendly. 3) The Southwest personnel weren't very friendly, though at least they weren't rude or hostile like I've experienced from SWA at other airports. 4) If you want to rent a car from SLC, you'll be paying a ridiculous airport surcharge of some kind, I took an Uber to and from Millcreek to rent a car. Even considering the cost of Uber, I still saved $80-100 rather than renting at the airport. I noticed that the rental car facilities from Farmington all the way down to Sandy were almost entirely booked, but the airport still had rental cars available. This is an obvious problem. 5) The WiFI is terrible and needs to actually be accessible for passengers. So, wonderful job overall, SLC! In fact, I'm impressed. Just work out your wrinkles, always find ways to improve and execute plans of action, and you can complete with the very best in Europe and even some in east Asia!",1,SLC

The only option is a wheelchair! Why in the world would elderly people be expected to traverse that far? And what about families traveling with small children? Who designed this monstrosity? Another thing I am extremely bothered by is how the people on the shuttles from off site parking facilities are treated like second class citizens. Those shuttles are no longer permitted to drop passengers off at the main doors. Instead they are dropped off downstairs, outside and made to trek completely through the car rental parking lots and up escalators to check in. Hotel shuttles are permitted to drop off at the main doors so why not off site shuttles?. Let's see - could it be that airport officials are trying to force passengers to pay their outrageous rates to park in their long term lots? It almost seems like they are trying to put the off site lots out of business! Terrible, terrible experience all around!

Used the people type movers where available. Took 20 minutes. Information desk told me where to wait for the shuttle to take me to SLC Trax to leave airport. Great signage. When I departed, dropped off at curb, up elevator to security check. Lines not long, but the automated bins seemed really slow compared to other security. So drop off to gate took 35 minutes.

2021-03-21,0.3,Business,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,get ready to walk and walk and walk,True," This airport is awful. Unless you happen to be in terminal A in some of the first gates, get ready to walk and walk and walk. In the design they did not include enough escalators and so both arriving and departing you queue to get on the escalator. Also, if you are in terminal B, you need to traverse under the tarmac. This is an incredibly long walk for an airport of this size - they state 7 minutes. Also, they oriented the entry to the airport at the end of terminal A instead of the middle. So for 3/4ths of the gates, get ready to walk. Also, terminal B, there are few amenities vs terminal A. Finally, for baggage claim, you need to commit to walk to one side or the other to see the posted bag claims for your flight. They should have signage before you have to commit to one side or another, otherwise you have to back track. Just feels like they could have accomplished all this with half the footprint. With all of the airport experience around the works, it is impossible to believe this airport could have been this poorly designed. I would recommend a serious rehab to fix these grave inconveniences. That said, it is new and clean. The skis come out on a dedicated ski carousel. The stores that do exist in terminal A are very nice.",-1,SLC

We traveled with my elderly in-laws and that walk was the most miserable experience.

I did have the unfortunate experience of negotiating the new parking structure recently. It is impossible except perhaps for someone in a smart car. Any driver in a normal size car will struggle and I can't imagine trying to access this structure in an SUV or a truck The amount of paint on the walls of every ramp tells the story better than any words. I do not have a large car and if I do say so myself, I'm an excellent driver, yet I came close to damaging the paint on my car several times going from one level to the next. There is barely enough room for the sideview mirrors to clear. Access to the ramps requires sharp almost impossible to make turns from the aisles. Even getting a ticket from the kiosk is challenging and the same is true for paying as one leaves. There is not enough room for two cars going opposite directions to pass in any of the aisles and backing out of a parking space without hitting the car parked opposite requires expertise in multi-point turning. One would think when designing a 4 billion dollar plus airport it would make sense to have it accessible to cars. I will never again attempt parking at this already white elephant airport.

By far the worst designed airport in the country. Staffing not far behind. Go early unless you are taking Delta and have good luck with security. Terminal B is an absurd walk. Security is really slow regardless of type of line you are in. Lines can be short or very long. Maybe anecdotal but extra security checks are high and I once waited over 10 minutes for someone to come check me on a random check. Had a shift change where the one did not move for 10 minutes once. Lost goes in and on. Baggage claim can take very long compared to other airports. Original SLC airport was old but great.

2021-03-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,avoid SLC international like the plague!,False,"  I'm glad to see it's not only me who really, really dislikes the new SLC International Airport. I've used an off-site parking lot/shuttle for years. The shuttles used to be able to drop you off and pick you up in front of the terminal. Now, the parking shuttles cannot get any closer than the parking garage. I'm guessing this is so you'll use official airport parking the next time you travel. With all your luggage, you must now walk for about 5-minutes, through the parking garage and then take an escalator or elevator to the next level. You're protected from rain or snow, but not heat or freezing cold temperatures. If you're flying Delta, you get to check in on that level. But if you're on another airline, you must take yet another elevator or escalator up to the top floor. I had a 28-inch bag to check in and a 21-inch carry-on. The larger bag got caught on a step while ascending, tipped back, and pinned me on my back, as the escalator moved upward. I was barely able to stand up before reaching the end of the escalator. During my weeklong vacation, I felt like I had a broken rib from the fall and had so many bruises, I was embarrassed to wear shorts. After checking my bag on the top level, I had to go back down a level to get to my gate. The terminals are now shaped like a giant T, but with 2 top crosses. Again, if you're on Delta, not so bad. All Delta gates are in concourse A. But to get to a non-Delta gate, you must take a very long tunnel to get to concourse B. Both the A and B concourses are linear and very long. It takes over 20 minutes to get from security to the very end of the B concourse! Just like on the freeway, there are digital signs telling you how long it will take to get to your gate. Thanks a lot. If it's a 15-minute walk and you only have 5-minutes to catch your flight, you're out of luck! Even with the ""walking escalators"" it's an extremely long walk, especially wearing a mask. The airport says it's adding a second tunnel to shorten the walk, but the tunnels are not going to be far enough apart to make a difference! If they wanted two parallel and linear concourses, they should have had parking, entrances, and TSA checkpoints on each side. I understand that SLC is a Delta hub. But if you're on another airline, you feel like you're being punished for not paying twice as much for a Delta ticket! If you're changing planes in SLC, make sure you have a minimum of 90-minutes between connections. If you arrive at the northwest end of concourse B and your next flight is leaving from the southeast end of concourse A, make sure you have running shoes on! I design buildings for a living. Not airports, but large hospitals. I love change! Especially in architecture. This design is horrible! Not well thought out at all! At least in Atlanta, you have the ""plane train"" to get you to the other end of the airport. How did someone not see this as a problem? Lots of people in SLC have lots of kids. Have fun carrying your little ones when he or she gets too tired to walk. Sure, the new airport looks nice, but it's awful to use! This is one of the worst architectural blunders I've ever experienced! Do yourself a favor, and avoid SLC international like the plague!",-1,SLC

Once we left the concourse there is no where to sit. Baggage claim takes forever. Once you get your bags the only place to sit is on your bags. We arrived very early on a very cold morning. To get to the pickup curb you have to walk across a skybridge. But when your ride arrives moments before you do they don't let the car wait for you to come out. The driver to circle the airport and you can either stand out in the cold, or play roulette by going back into the terminal.

No shuttle? Train? Continuous fast moving sidewalk? Eating choices are horrible? No McDonald's? Burger King? Nothing but fancy choices and very income discriminating options especially for low income travelers with children. How could you spend so much and get the whole, I mean whole idea wrong. Did you not travel to great airports like Denver or Fort Myers? Feels more like elite club then fun travel center. Designers should be released from duty and citizens hired to fix who actually travel. Medellin Colombia has better airport at half the cost. You spent all this money and the security checkpoint is all you kinda got right. 1 star rating for design and execution.",-1,SLC
2021-02-23,0.2,Solo Leisure,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,They really missed the mark!,True," Am absolutely dumfounded by the lack of customer/passenger flow dynamic in the design of the new airport to get from the terminal to gates if you are not flying Delta airlines. It's literally a mile of walking each way. Did the design get awarded to the lowest bidder?! Upon arrival and departure on my United flights, I/we had to walk over a mile to/from security to the gate, which only boarded you on to a ramp to get on a bus that took you to/from the plane a half mile away on the tarmac. If I was on the board of United, Southwest, American, etc. I would be up in arms about this lack of competent design flow for my paying customers. Calling it a work in progress is a cop out for a really poorly thought out concept. I've been flying in/out of SLC for 3 decades, and I am in awe that this was allowed to move forward like this. It's a significant step backward. The aesthetics of the main terminal are nice and interesting, but it's a small consolation for its poor layout. The murals on the south half of the underground walkway from concourse A to B are nice with the seasons of Utah being depicted, but the North half looks like it got awarded to a middle school in the district. Given all the revenue dumped into this project, I am left scratching my head that this concept moved through as many levels of review necessary for this type of new construction, and no one raised the very legitimate point of ease of use by their customers. They really missed the mark!",-1,SLC

I fly twice a month in/out of SLC and the new design is woefully lacking. Extended taxiing, long waits on the parking ramp for gates you have to be bussed to while there are open gates at terminals A and B. 10-15 min walk to bag claim or your gate. Long waits for baggage. Minimal concessions with very long waits. Traffic for passenger pickup is slow and terrible, there are cars constantly waiting on the shoulder. Parking garage is $5 for under 30min. Parking garage is very tight and cars are constantly making contact with the concrete walls. Somebody should lose their job and be drummed out of engineering, architecture or whatever made this abomination. On another note...the security check-in is swift and has some nice innovation. The facilities are clean.",-1,SLC

Long walks to baggage claim, took an hour to get bags, totally unimaginative terminal. I feel like I went back in time and am pining for the old terminal. This airport makes LAX look like the Taj Mahal. After flying over 50 times a year I can honestly say that the designers of this fiasco should be barred from ever picking up a grease pen ever again. As an aside..let's be Covid safe by not putting four incoming flights onto one baggage carousel and concentrating 150 irate passengers in close proximity while the other carousel sit idle.",-1,SLC

2021-02-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,this airport is an absolute pain,False,"  I travel often for work and have been through many airports. None of them are as horribly designed as Salt Lake City. Unless you are flying Delta this airport is an absolute pain, and get ready to walk forever. To get to any airline gate other than Delta be prepared to walk a mile in a concrete tunnel to get to the B terminal. Walking from the high number B gates and then through the concrete tunnel, and then through almost the entire A terminal is ridiculous. On top of that, don't follow the ground transportation signs if you have a private vehicle picking you up. As soon as you leave the airport you only have access to buses or Lyft and Uber. Private vehicles are blocked by an 8 foot concrete and metal wall. There are zero signs pointing out that you have to then go back upstairs across a sky bridge and back down an escalator to have access to your private transportation. Extremely poor design, and even worse signage to point you in the right direction. Oh, and I better not forget don't plan on decent food if you have a layover. The food options are pathetic at best.",-1,SLC

I will take the old one any day over this new one. If you are some what limited on your walking ability like a mile or less you will need to make arrangements for assistance. If you are coming in on a tight flight schedule figure on missing your connection. There is no way you will get from one terminal to another in less than 20 minutes.,-1,SLC
2021-02-04,0.3,Business,3.0,5.0,,3.0,0.0,,,,forgot functionality for travelers,True,  I’m not sure if who designed this airport but they need to have there head checked. They put so much thought into the artsy stuff that they forgot functionality for travelers. Hopefully you don’t have a flight out of B1 if so give your self plenty of time no thought was put into the b terminal or getting there especially if you land in A and have a short connection in B. Also pickup is ridiculous. They should have made all lanes accessible from bottom side like every other airport in the US. But hey the art and the lights are nice.,-1,SLC

My daughter and I flew into Concourse B. The fact that you have to walk all the way through that concourse, down a long corridor into the middle of concourse A, then walk that section before you can head down stairs into the baggage claim area. Wear a tee shirt because it’s the worlds longest walk. I thought O’Hare can be bad, but whoever architected this layout needs to rethink things!",-1,SLC

2021-01-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,this hellhole of an airport,False,"  The settlers probably had a shorter trip from the colonies to the western frontier than I did getting from terminal A to terminal B. It makes zero sense why they have to space the two terminals so ungodly far. I missed my first flight because I didn’t take into account the over 30 minute pilgrimage from security to my gate. Unless you are an Olympic marathon runner the walking distance will be nothing short of a ginormous pain. I practically broke my already sprained ankle just to get to my gate only to be greeted by an unsympathetic United airlines attendant who told me that I had missed the 10 minute boarding window. Who knows if this absurdly short boarding time is some cruel joke or the result of the attendant’s sub-first grade math skills, but it quite literally is beyond my understanding.  By the end of the ordeal my aim was not to return home but simply escape this hellhole of an airport.",-1,SLC

I arrived on Southwest at the far end of terminal B. I started walking, and walking and more walking. I'm 65 years old and must have walked for what seemed like 25 minutes to get to terminal A and then struggled to see the signs for exiting. Once I got out of the airport I ended up first at UBER drop off, then UBER pickup. I had to go back in up an escalator, across a sky bridge and down to passenger pick-up. Very poor signage.",-1,SLC
2021-01-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,4.0,The long walks are ridiculous,True," I guess when they were designing this airport they were trying to mimic the nightmares of Heathrow. The long walks are ridiculous. A18 to A25 aren't bad but any other gate is over a mile walk. If you fly anyone but Delta your screwed going to terminal B. What are the elderly, or people with young children, or the disabled supposed to do. This layout was obviously designed by marathon running 18 year old because no one with intelligence or experience would have done this.",-1,SLC
2021-01-18,0.5,Couple Leisure,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,new airport complex is not traveler friendly,True," The new airport terminal complex is beautiful in architecture and has plentiful and clean restrooms. However, the eateries seem to be almost all high end with focus on adults and alcoholic drinks. Traveling with children leaves essentially no food options conducive to young tastes or family budgets. We discovered there were hardly any food options for quick take away to take aboard aircraft. The old terminal avoided these shortcomings with availability of McDonalds, Burger King, Popeye Chicken, etc; why have such/similar eateries been omitted?. It makes no sense for the Shakes Shack eatery to be located where travelers have exited the secured terminal area. The new eateries seem to be focused more on high profitability and business travelers; while overlooking the need for traveling families to feed their children at reasonable prices. My wife and I are senior ages and the arduous 20 minute trek between TSA check and Southwest gates in Terminal 2 left us exhausted. Signage could be improved for luggage pickup carousels; overhead signs give the airline arrival flight numbers, but no information on which carousel luggage is to be found. The Honolulu terminal had a very helpful feature; public address system frequently announced which luggage carousel was being used for each incoming flight. This new airport complex while attractive, is not traveler friendly.",-1,SLC
2021-01-18,0.3,Business,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4.0,What a disappointment!,True," Lived in SLC in the 90's and travelled back and forth hundreds of times. Today was my first visit to new SLC Airport. What a disappointment! Need to walk miles to get the the exit. Terminal B is behind Terminal A connected by underground passage that looks horrible - cheap version of O'Hare United Terminal B to C connector. Both terminals look like anywhere USA, with the exit from the airport to the car rental that reminds of a scaled down version Miami International. Who did that project, and who approved it? Suddenly my favorite airport is gone, new not friendly for older travelers due to long distances to cover. Would recommend to have an extra hour or so to be able to get to the right gate.",-1,SLC
2021-01-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,The new SLC airport is a joke!,False,"  The new SLC airport is a joke! The amount of walking you have to do to get to any airline gate besides the Delta is absurd! 20 minutes even with moving walkways and that is no exaggeration. Very poor design. Clearly they don't value anyone's time or needs of senior citizens, small children, individuals with knee issues or individuals with weight problems. I was nothing but angry after coming in on a late flight. I had to wait for my luggage in the cold since my airline checked everyone's luggage at the gate for this flight. All I wanted was to get out of the airport and get home but had to walk 20 minutes from my gate to get to my pick-up. A real deterrent for anyone flying in or out from this airport. Does not meet needs.",-1,SLC

For a big airport and only having 1 TSA check point is horrible, signage for Priority line is almost invisible and only saw it after waiting in half mile general boarding line. The walk to B gates is an absolute JOKE. And once there the options of food or drink or adult beverages is evan more depressing. To think of the cost of this new terminal and it’s extremely poor design for passengers is mind boggling. Salt Lake City you should be ashamed of your self for approving this airport. It needs major upgrades already.",-1,SLC
2021-01-16,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,New design is horrible,False,"  New design is horrible. Getting to B terminal is a very long walk. Some of the automatic walkways were broken. You have to walk to the center of terminal A, then go down under the tarmac, walk another long way under the tarmac and then come back up. Then you have to walk again. With a spouse who has trouble walking it was brutal. Whomever designed this airport and signed off on the design should be fired.",-1,SLC

I have never walked such a long distance at any other airport I’ve used! I’m a senior citizen, with back and knee problems, which makes this airport not user friendly. I was escorting my minor grandchild to and from her flights to gate A-2, by the time we made it to the gate, surely we had walked to the neighboring city of Bountiful! I can only imagine if they had gate changes, people would be livid! As for the luggage pickup. I agree there isn’t enough info to get you to the correct Carousel!

I watched a young mother with 2 small children try and carry luggage and push stroller all the way to B gate. Rolling walkways were not that helpful. 2 words, train system! It would not only help families with children but elderly get from tsa to gates. A passenger could easily miss their flight if not made aware of the long walk ahead. Poor design. Even the airport staff I spoke with told me how unhappy they are with the layout and encouraged me to write a review because the ""higher-ups"" won't listen to them! Very poor design.",-1,SLC

TSA agents, people working at food places, and other staff with masks well below their nose or mouth. Lines for security are packed with absolutely no social distancing. Passengers in the airport with masks down or no masks at all in line for food, in walkways and at gates. Over half of the hand sanitizer stations are empty. Soaps in the bathrooms empty too. It's as if they don't know or care about COVID 19. SLC airport should be appalled. They most certainly are aiding in the spread of COVID19 in ways that are completely avoidable. Avoid this airport at all costs during COVID19. Make them reevaluate their practices and take this pandemic more seriously. I felt extremely unsafe in this airport.",-1,SLC

In the past, I would brag to my clients how easy it was to fly in and out of SLC airport. It was efficient, welcoming, well marked, and had great food & beverage options. Having flown in and out in November-December 2020, I can no longer say that. Whoever designed and then approved the design of the new airport should be publicly fired and publicized so the persons/companies involved never get another chance to screw up a good thing. I actually used the pedometer on my phone when returning to SLC. It was over a mile and a quarter walk from my Southwest gate to baggage claim. There were a few moving sidewalks, but even so, with a heavy carry-on (same one I've used for years), a mask, and the exhaustion of flying several hours with plane changes, it was ridiculous. There were few places to sit and rest along the way and no places to get a needed beverage. I'm a fairly healthy 64 year old woman with minor back and knee issues. That walk left me in pain for 2 days. Why are there not trams like other large airports? Who actually thought this mess was a good idea? If I had another option, I'd use it. It's a mess and needs to be completely renovated now before someone has a heart attack or worse on the mile+ walk. The silly looking waves sculptures should be taken down and traded in for a few needed golf carts.",-1,SLC
2021-01-11,0.3,Couple Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,"For a new wonderful airport, it was awful",True," The people of Utah got bilked. For a new wonderful airport, it was awful. I travel weekly for work and have done so for the past 10 years, apart from current COVID impacts. And I would much rather have been in the old SLC airport than the new one. First, off-site parking doesn't get to pull even close to the terminal. You have to traverse the rental car garage, really. Even Denver lets them pull on the outer lanes. Then if you have walking issues, like my spouse, you are hosed. Extreme lack of moving walk ways, and then the ones they have are like 20 years ago. Look at Denver, they need to be wider! Allowing people both to stand and walk without hitting bags or feeling like you are pushed to the side. And seating, who cares about the wonderful silhouettes of the canyons, people need comfortable places to sit, especially when they need to rest after walking from one end of the terminal to the baggage claim. And for baggage claim, again, not enough signs to find the right baggage claim. It was too much walking, and didn't make sense that passenger ride shares can pull up to terminal, but off-site shuttles are banned to the 'west 40'. I was just not impressed. I walked as much in SLC as I did in ATL, a much older airport, with no moving walkways in the gate terminals, where I had to go from an A gate to a D gate. So for a new state of the art airport, way too much unused space and total lack of moving walk ways. Not sure who this airport was designed for. Must have just looked good on paper. But is terrible in usefulness and reality. Really let down by the new airport.",-1,SLC
2021-01-11,0.1,Business,1.0,2.0,,3.0,0.0,,,,I had to walk what seemed like a mile,False,"  Horrible design. My plane was at gate A2. My son was flying out of B24. I had to walk what seemed like a mile (didn't the designers/architects visit Detroit to find out how to get people from one end of the terminal to another?) and my son had to walk about 2/3 of it, only to have to then proceed down an escalator, walk to the B terminal, then walk back to the east another 1/4 mile in order to then ride a bus to his plane. Unbelievable. The entrance is beautiful, I enjoy the aesthetics but once past the entrance/security hall, the airport looks like every other major city airport but way less efficient. The beauty is quickly forgotten when you are walking over a mile, wearing a mask, dragging suitcases. People should be fired over this.",-1,SLC
2021-01-09,0.2,Business,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,New airport is a complete design failure,False,"  Almost everything is worse, hardly anything is better. New airport is a complete design failure. Customer experience was never a consideration. I had high hopes for the new modernized airport as I travel out of SLC several times a month. Let's start with parking. Economy lot is exactly the same except the busses are running slower. Parking garage is about the same but less convenient now. Skycap is missing. WiFi is still slow and terrible. The long walk to terminal B for absolutely no good reason at all. Prepare for a hike, bring running shoes, water etc. Just remember to enjoy the gigantic, over-sized ""artwork"" on the walls of the terminal. They cut budget for a tram but the costly sculptures remain. Enjoy! Entrance - worse, like everything else. Be prepared to visit all 3 floors just to catch a flight. You might arrive at street level, up to level 3 to check in then back down to level 2 for TSA and to the gates. Whoever designed the airport was definitely buddies with the escalator company. Complete with people dragging their bags and kids up and down escalators because the airport was not designed for customers. They severely overlooked the importance of the entrance and check-in process. TSA - Worse, slower. Newer does not mean faster when it comes to the TSA. New bins are terrible, slow and there's a good chance your bin comes out the other side without everything you put in it! Watching the TSA poke around the machine with their stick, trying to find lost items is kind of amusing when it's not my item. Food - Less choices. The same restaurants as before like Squatters but got rid of the cheap stuff and fast food. I enjoy the nicer restaurants but sometimes just need something quick and cheap. Not enough coffee shops, not enough anything. The new strip of designer stores are a fail, empty or nearly empty every time I've walked by. Trying to have a mini-mall instead of more food options serves nobody. Prices in the convenience stores have gone up considerably. The good, barely. Pickup area is bigger. Previously, the lanes were sandwiched between the terminal and parking garage and could never be expanded. Same design but starting out bigger and should be adequate for now. Sitting areas not near the gates are larger, more spaced out and have plenty of electrical outlets and charge ports. Airport isn't completed, apparently they will chip away for years before it's done. There's a chance things will improve but several more years of transitional airport operations due to ongoing construction has the potential to suck.",-1,SLC

I thought there was going to be another terminal added, but instead they added an extra set of gates a half mile away (more?) that you have to walk after security.

This so called new layout is the worst I have ever experienced in my years of flying. I am a senior and have trouble walking long distances. This new design is the worst design I have seen.

I have walked numerous airports in the USA and this surpasses them all for ridiculous design. From the time you get through TSA, you should expect a 20 minute brisk walk to arrive at a B gate. The locations where off airport Parking shuttles drop off is a good 10 minute walk to the TSA lines. Overall a colossal fail in design.

This airport was built for singles under 40, neither families nor those not trading for a marathon, I saw numerous people running to catch their flight exacerbated by the distance between gates. When we arrived it seemed like a mile walk to the car rentals. Where are the sky trams or passenger trains. Did the architect design this in a vacuum? Go visit Atlanta’s airport, or Detroit. These airports move people as opposed to having the people hike. On our return flight today we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours as over 100 bags were missing. The baggage system broke and the pilot said it was a fiasco. I can understand a mechanical breakdown, but failure to test seems to be in keep with the other lack of attention to detail this airport exhibits.

Allow at least an hour just to walk to your gate - it’s insane how far apart the terminals are from each other. I arrived 2 hours before my flight, waited in line for security for an hour and then had to sprint to my gate to not miss my flight. Little did I know I would be sprinting for a good 2 miles, no exaggeration. The airport layout is ridiculous especially with no transpiration to these extremely far concourses.",-1,SLC
2021-01-04,0.2,Solo Leisure,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,get input from the traveling public,True," Obviously this airport was designed by an architecture student who had never traveled by plane. It is a more aesthetically pleasing airport than its predecessor, but the outdated predecessor was 10 times more functional. Security screening should be on the same level as airline check in as that seems to be the worldwide norm. Instead, you check in then immediately have to ride an escalator or elevator to security screening area. Guess what, security screening is located right where all the arriving passengers have to claim their luggage! Brilliant. Speaking of claiming your luggage, there is one thing that was brought over from the predecessor, the infamous luggage destroyer carousels. It’s 2021 and there are much better designs than the drop and crash luggage destroyer. Look it up, Nashville, Fort Lauderdale, even JFK have no dump and destroy carousels. Oh and after you claim your bags, you have to cross the sky bridge and then ride and escalator or elevator to get to the street pick up. Here’s an idea, put baggage claim on ground level. Don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten about the insane length of time it takes to get to the B gates and how they couldn’t figure out how to line up the connector with the main entry corridor. Obviously this airport was designed by a person who had a vested interest in escalator, elevator and moving walkway sales and installation as I find it difficult to believe any reasonably intelligent person could not figure out some of these challenges before this design was approved. Here’s an idea, get input from the traveling public, you know the people who actually pay for and use the facility. I can assure you even the least architecturally educated among us could create a more functional and less time intensive design. Alas, I’m just a simpleton who believes the shortest distance is a straight line.",-1,SLC
2021-01-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,,3.0,the worst airport design,True," As mentioned in other reviews, this is the worst airport design. I’m a healthy 67 year old woman and the distance of walking with luggage is ridiculous. I will not use this airport again unless they install trams or carts. My daughter had a time getting her two young children to walk with their carry-ons that distance. Very bad design, shame on the architects.",-1,SLC
2021-01-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,,4.0,,my return was a nightmare,True," When I left I left from an A gate. I was impressed by the new airport. The modern art, the cool stores, the restrooms every 3rd gate. I have flown out of this airport for 15 years and was truly blown away. But my return was a nightmare. Our plane literally parked way out on the tarmac somewhere. We had to walk outside the plane down a ramp (in winter) to a shuttle bus. The bus drove us to B gates—which is nowhere near the baggage claim. 3/4 of a mile walk later around the entire airport I finally got to baggage claim. Got my bag and the signage that used to be so clear about where to get ground transportation didn’t exist anymore. I went out a door for shuttles, and had to ask a Trax bus driver where the Economy shuttle line was. She directed me to 6c which was further down. Who designs an airport like this? It’s a giant U, and no one thought “hey—how about a connecting tram between the gates? It’s insane. God forbid I had a connecting flight to make. Even so—it was practically an asthma attack just to get from the tarmac to my bag. And one of the walkways in the opposite directions wasn’t even working. I felt so bad for those people. Build a tram like every other city has done. These distances are crazy for a healthy person, let alone someone who is older, infirm, running late, and etc.",-1,SLC
2020-12-31,0.2,Business,1.0,4.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,the worst experience I have had,False,"  After a life of much travel, domestic and international, this was the worst experience I have had. Had I known that I would be forced to walk for more than 45 minutes with a carry-on shoulder bag, I would have carried-on a roller bag. Next time, for sure. The signage was unclear: the moving walkways appeared to be going to A terminal and the baggage claim sign to the left suggested that one should walk on the left side where there were no moving walkways. When I figured out that I could go on a moving walkway, the last one ended and a left turn toward baggage claim presented a further long walk with no moving walkways. Also, the moving walkways were jammed: no social distancing and no airport attendants to make certain that would happen. The thoughts I wrestled with were that I am older but fortunately in good health. If I had not been and had a heart condition as do many of my age, I might have suffered a heart attack from the length of the walk and having to carry a bag. And I feared exposure to Covid on the jammed moving walkways and escalators. Thirdly, I wondered how far I would have had to walk in a short time, had I been making a connection. Finally, after retrieving my luggage, I stopped a bicycle-riding SLC policeman to ask how to go to passenger pick up and he looked at me with two large suitcases and brusquely said ""go up those stairs over there."" Right. I like to be supportive of police, but that was the unkindest cut of all. I would like to say that I would avoid SLC in the future, but I live in Jackson Hole and every trip I take must go through Salt Lake. In an era of technological advance and sophistication, what idiots designed the new airport? It is a crime -- and I suspect there will be many passengers suffering health problems while at the airport. They had better lay on large numbers of motorized carts and people to operate them and provide clearer signage.",-1,SLC
2020-12-31,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,5.0,3.0,too many problems with the new facility,True,"  Worst airport experience ever. I’ve been flying for 40 years, domestic and international. I always look forward to experiencing a new airport or sizable expansion, such as SLC has recently undergone. Unfortunately, there are too many problems with the new facility to enumerate. The remote (as in feels like you are in the next county) nature of the B terminal is particularly troublesome. On arrival in terminal B, the single down escalator designed to give access to the pedestrian tunnel to terminal A was out of service. There was no ongoing effort to repair the equipment nor any effort made by airport personnel to advise travelers of the situation—just a huge “traffic jam” (btw, interesting social experiment—social distancing immediately collapsed, health is apparently less important than getting ahead). I agree wholeheartedly with those who wonder if those who designed and executed the expansion actually travel regularly. Travelers beware: If you have a right connection you are likely to miss it, particularly if it in involves a terminal transfer. There are certain airports I have avoided for years. For instance, given the choice I would ordinarily fly through SLC over DIA every day of the week. Not anymore. SLC has catapulted straight to the top of my list of airports to avoid.",-1,SLC
2020-12-30,0.3,Couple Leisure,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,it was a miserable experience,True," My wife (who is on oxygen) and I had to leave from and returned to gates at the very end of the main concourse - of the very, very, very long main concourse. There are moving walkways - 4, to be exact - that are very, very far apart, and there is nowhere for a handicapped person to sit and rest between those walkways. Everything is very clean and sanitized - with nowhere to rest. There are no kiosks in the concourse with airport maps showing what stores are available within that long concourse, either, so if you're looking for something, you have to physically re-walk that long, long concourse. On one of those walkways, I spied a food place with a few blocked-off tables, but nothing like at PDX or SeaTac or O'Hare. There are very few places to eat, anyway - so maybe that is why they don't bother with kiosks. Once out of the concourse and past the security doors, there are multiple ""island"" features where one can sit and get a breath, which is a good thing, because it is another long, long walk to get to baggage claims - which is another long problem. There are two sets of carousels - one to the left of the security exit, and one to the right. Neither is clearly marked overhead, but one is for Delta, the other for all other carriers. The video screens to tell you where your luggage will be are both a long way from where you first see them - so you have to walk hundreds of feet - only to find out you should have gone the other way. Then, I had to pass four empty, unused carousels to get to my luggage. So then, I could finally leave the terminal and go out to my waiting daughter. Except: When you leave the terminal, you are in the area for shuttles. You walk to one of two crosswalks, and get to the area for Uber and Lyft vehicles. Then you find that there is a concrete wall between you and the place passenger cars can pick you up, so you get to go back across the shuttle area, back in the terminal, up to the second floor, across those lanes and back down to the ground to get out where you can be picked up. All in all, it was a miserable experience. I have been in hundreds of airports around the world. I have never had such a miserable experience. Even getting kicked out of Elmas on Cagliari when it closed and my ride hadn't come was not as bad as this. Just one more proof that ""new and improved"" is a lie. It is a false lie!",-1,SLC
2020-12-27,0.6,Family Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,The airport is made for solo travelers,True," After checking-in, in order to get to the TSA checkpoint, you must go down one level, which is uncommon for US airports. From what I saw, there is only one checkpoint for the entire airport, which could cause long lines during the busy time. We were departing in the late evening, and the line seemed to be about 10-15 minutes long, while the TSA-Pre and priority lanes were completely empty. The security equipment was brand new, and the process went smoothly until I was selected for an additional security check due to my arm brace. The agent was quite rude and forcefully patted down the brace and caused pain after collecting three substance samples and two hand metal detector tests. Additionally, the same agent flipped everything out of one of our suitcases to confiscate a bottle of lotion that was 5 millilitres over the limit and has passed through multiple airports before. Past security, there were a few restaurants like Shake Shack and only one lounge, the Delta SkyClub. Most stores are still under construction. The A gates, which are used by Delta are located within a few minutes of walking distance. However, all other airlines depart from the B gates, which require all passengers to once again go one level lower and walk for quite a large amount of time. The B gates do have restaurants, however, the best options are closer to the entrance of the airport at the A gates. The wifi worked well and all seats were equipped with a power outlet. The airport is made for solo travelers, the layout and long walking distances are not designed for families and people who may need assistance. If you plan on flying with a large group or require mobility help, flying Delta is best as their gates are closest.",1,SLC
2020-12-26,0.1,Business,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,definitely not customer friendly,True,"  I have used this airport for many years to travel on business in the western USA. After my recent experience at the ""new"" airport, I will be looking for a new western USA base. Simply put, I honestly cannot think of anything positive to say about this new airport. The new parking garage is a mess. The signage is quite poor. I wanted to park my rental car in the short term area as I have always done. But when I pulled up the ramp, there were two ways I could go: the left-hand ramp went up, so I took the right-hand entrance. The garage is very poorly designed. The entrances to the garage are VERY narrow, and you have to enter on a right-angle, which made things very tricky. Fortunately I had a very small car, but it was a tight squeeze even so. Once I got into Level Two, I saw a sign stating that overnight parking was not permitted. I drove around for a least 5 minutes, trying to find either someone to help me or the way up to Level Three. There WAS a booth that said ""Information"" but no one was around. So I drove around for another 5 minutes, trying to find the exit. There are signs pointing to ""exit"" but in fact many of them just lead right back into the same level! When I finally DID find the exit, it was unmarked, off to the side in an odd location, and not only did it require a 90-degree turn, but there was a long concrete barrier about six inches high alongside the exit. I couldn't pull into it, so I had to go all the way around and then swing wide. As it was, it was a VERY tight lane, as was the entrance to the down ramp. When I finally got to the exit, I asked the lady at the ticket booth where I could park overnight. She told me to go left, up to Level Three, and that she would immediately call her supervisor, who would meet me at the entrance, to help me. Needless to say, no one up there on Level 3 either. When I got down to the check-in area, it was absolute chaos. Long lines to get a baggage tag, even longer lines to drop the bag off: and the counters were fully staffed. The chaos was not the fault of the airline, but rather the poor airport design. Very poorly laid-out and definitely not customer friendly. I asked the lady at check-in how I was to get to my gate. She said, ""you're at B20"" and that's a bit of a walk: 1.2 miles, actually."" As it turned out it was even further than that! Another airport employee told me later that they were going to build an underground train to connect Terminals A and B, but had no idea if/when that would actually be completed. Several of the rolling walkways were also not functioning. I felt sorry for the older people that I saw that were clearly struggling with that hike. The signage throughout the airport is poor. For example, to get to Terminal B from Terminal A, you have to walk halfway down Terminal A, then take the stairs (or escalators, if they're working) down to the tunnel that leads to B. One would think that this would be frequently signposted but in fact it is not. I wandered around for quite a while before I stumbled upon it. Returning to SLC was more of the same. There are a few signs for ""Baggage Claim"" and then they suddenly disappear. Again, a fair bit of wandering and I finally found: right at the entrance to Terminal A! Not secure at all. For those of you that travel internationally, let me describe SLC: it makes Frankfurt or Paris Charles de Gaulle seem organized and friendly. By the way beer and coffee are basically your only food options..",-1,SLC

You have to walk for ever to get to the B gates, sorry if you’re older or out of shape. Smaller planes require a long walk outside to a bus, which then inefficiently transports you to your plane on the tarmac.

Arrived in SLC airport to visit family on November 18 and left November 29, 2020. I was shocked at the poor design when I arrived and had to walk and walk and walk. As a college professor from New England, I decided to collect annotated data on the trip back. Yes, the art is lovely but if your mood is impaired by the physical requirements to manage your experience, who cares? I was traveling alone with 2 suitcases and 2 carry-ons. I had a rental car. The moment I returned the rental and took my first step towards the terminal, I started my stop watch on my phone. Me and 4 pieces of luggage headed for the first elevator. Up to rental but unfortunately, my airline did not have a check in person at the rental area, nice idea but no help here. Over to the main terminal. Check in, a total of 5 elevators and 44 minutes of walking (there were no lines due to COVID travel so waiting did not change my time). Finally get to the gate to hear a disembarking flight attendant say to the pilot, ""are you ready for a long walk?"" The pilot says, this is my first time here. I think to myself, ""this is my last time here."" And I mean it, the family will have to visit later at one of our family reunions, I am not going back the the SLC airport ever again. Who in their right mind designed this building? My only last thought is to keep the poor employees who must push a wheelchair in this environment in your thoughts.",-1,SLC

The airport has now put up distances and times on the internet in their review. They did not count the distance from drop off or pickup.

Flew American and had to walk miles, and change levels repeatedly. It's the worst organized airport I've ever seen. There are almost no moving sidewalks, and the few there are are either broken or move so slow they're infuriating. I saw NO other people moving options like indoor shuttles. There are no shuttles between terminals. The signs are too infrequent to help, and almost invisible, and totally confusing. I made numerous wrong turns as a result and walked even further, then had to back track. Furthermore the sign for long term parking shuttle directs people out the wrong door, farthest from the shuttle. I don't understand how a new airport can be this bad and do virtually everything wrong. I don't see how people with mobility problems can get around that mess. Horrible ordeal using that airport.

If you’re traveling on any airline other than Delta (which I never will fly again) bring a sturdy pair of hiking boots, your walking stick and a snack to eat along the way. I’m only slightly exaggerating here. It’s almost exactly a mile walk from the airlines ticket counters to the B gates. I felt bad while following someone with a severe limp trying to make the trek. It’s seems obvious that the airport is trying to disservice customers into flying on Delta. I wonder how much Delta paid the city to make sure everyone who flies any other airline will have to walk forever! I enjoy walking when I’m in a national park, but in an airport when trying to make a flight? No good! You failed big time!

You literally walk over 1 mile if you are in b concourse. The designers sure spent a lot of time and money on the art but totally forgot to worry about how to effectively move people. The walk ways are extremely slow and narrow. If you plan on ever using this airport allow 30 min of walking time to get to the gate. Sad sad state of affairs for such a new airport. If it were built in the 60’s would still be a poor excuse for moving people. I have been in airports easily 4 times the size of this airport and walk 75% less.

It is gorgeous to be sure. But you have to walk through the entire Delta concourse before taking a very long underground tunnel to the second concourse where every other airline is housed. That underground tunnel is 50% longer than the tunnel at O'Hare between the two United concourses. To get to a Southwest or United gate is a solid 20 minute walk (approx. 1 mile) both when you depart and when you arrive. The ""everybody but Delta"" concourse also has very little food. It is as if Delta decided to punish every traveler who was not flying Delta with an extra 20 minutes of walking time, both arriving and departing. The tunnel to the second concourse could easily have been placed at the front of the Delta concourse instead of the back. Forcing someone to walk the entire length of the Delta concourse before having to then walk the entire length of the second concourse is punitive - I can't think of another word for it. Shame on Delta. Shame on the SLC airport authority. It used to be a delight to fly in and out of the SLC airport.

My times to get from the gate to a rental car have tripled. I used to be able to return a car and be at my gate in 15 min. My first trip after the new opening took 1hr and 18 min of confusion and exhaustion. Anyone who can make it from the rental car facility to gate G in one trip deserves a medal. I have to rest at 2 locations to make it. They have some people movers but so far at least 50% are always broken. They also don't have enough restrooms so if you come off a plane and have been holding it for 2-1/2 hrs plan on holding it a lot longer. Signage is poor. The main terminal is on multiple levels and confusing. The luggage machines at security take time and separate your bags making grabbing them less efficient. The whole airport sucks and they need golf carts for people who can't make the required hike to their terminals. I have been traveling for work for 14 years, I've been in all US airports and usually fly around 300 flights a year. I have no issues getting around any of them.

2020-01-08,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,undergoing an impressive remodelling and modernization,True," SLC airport is undergoing an impressive remodelling and modernization as we speak, which is appropriate considering that the SLC region and Utah is one of the best regions in the USA in terms of actually maintaining and improving physical infrastructure. The regional and state governments there seem to understand that that not only improves the quality of life for the residents, but it also provides a wonderful aspect for people who are tourists or doing business in the area. That said, here are the airport's strong suits: 1) Signage to wherever you need to go, whether in the terminal, at check-in, or driving into or away from the airport, is usually ample and straightforward. 2) The airport is generally clean, with the major exception of a few gates in an older terminal whose remodel still isn't yet complete (in that case, that particular area I saw was actually pretty dirty). 3) Renting a car, returning a rental car, or taking light rail from and to the airport are all pretty easy (at least Enterprise Rent-A-Car was easy). 4) I don't remember ever meeting even a grumpy or gruff person working at this airport, even TSA, in my experience, were all business with their security monitoring, but courteous and efficient. If you have TSA Pre-Check, that always helps. 5) The exterior of the new terminal under construction as part of the remodeling process conveys SLC's ambition to be an even more modern, more ambitious, and more traveler-friendly metropolis. 6) I still find it hilariously ironic that there are direct flights between SLC and Amsterdam, considering the stereotypes of those regions. Now, for a real con, the present construction work has resulted in some lane changes driving around the airport that require the driver to pay close attention, or else miss their exit or turn or just crash into some concrete barrier.

They were respectful, friendly, efficient, and quick. The only annoying incident was in August when the man checking my ID had me take off my glasses. No one’s ever had me to that. Overall, I highly recommend the airport and staff!",1,SLC
2019-05-16,0.5,Business,3.0,5.0,,2.0,0.0,,,1.0,need to consider a different approach,True, As I waited in line with everyone else for TSA (pre-check) I had two airport employees step directly in front of me as I was next in line pending TSA review. It was rude behavior and made everyone waiting angry. This process should not be allowed (or if it is allowed the airport should post a sign explaining the exception). I understand employees are “going to work” but when the rest of the world drives to work each morning do they pass other drivers on the emergency lane because they have a scheduled shift? The message airport patrons take away is that airport employees time is more valuable than the airport travelers (who by the way have a plane to catch). Many travelers find themselves in a hurry or experience higher than normal stress levels when traveling and having someone cut right in front of you because they didn’t plan accordingly annoys everyone. Salt Lake City (and other airports) really need to consider a different approach or risk escalated traveler irritation. Why make a stressful experience more stressful.,-1,SLC
2019-01-27,0.9,Solo Leisure,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,Lots of seating around,True," Totally impressed by the cheerful disposition and friendliness of all the staff at the airport. Noticing the empty water bottle in my back pag, the TSA agent, on her own, told me where to find a water fountain. The clerk at the enquiry counter suggested I call the hotel to let them know I had arrived instead of waiting for their shuttle to come on their own schedule - a very useful tip! Young staff greeted passengers and offered assistance. Signage throughout the airport was clear. Lots of seating around. Many shops and eateries. Bathrooms clean. Car rental garage adjacent to the terminal - a huge convenience obviating the need to take a shuttle to and fro from the lot. Finally, the setting of the terminal, surrounded by mountains which were snow covered was just memorably breath taking. Lot of construction taking place outside the terminal - hence one needs to pay attention to lanes and road directions when driving in or out. It was a pleasure using this airport.",1,SLC

",False,"  My roommate and I just got off our flight, she had to wait for her bag and I went ahead to make sure our next flight didn’t leave without us (on the other side of the airport) so I got to the bottom of the gate (this gate had metal bars/runway when heading away from it) and I just wanted to tell her that I’ll hold the plane to make sure she got it (our cell phones weren’t sending texts at this time). The attendant at the gate, as I got into talking space with my roommate yelled at me saying that I can’t go up there because they don’t know if I was on that flight. That I just got off of 10 seconds ago. Clearly trying to tell my roommate the game plan. She was very rude and wasn’t willing to help at all. I will make sure I avoid this airport at all costs in the future. I work in retail and am an Assisant Store Manager of a large world wide retailer and if someone was “breaking the rule” I would kindly tell them and ask how I could help/support to make sure their taken care of.

I always travel with a service animal and SLC is one of the least pet friendly airports. They do have 2 pet relief areas but you will be lucky to be be near one. I normally traverse through C gate and its a long walk to the B or E relief area. Worst part is once you finally arrive you have to search for someone to get the gate open which is about a 30 min process on all 3 times I have flown in to this airport. If your lucky a gate agent is near by, if not good luck to find one. Then any gate agent you find needs to call someone which is another 15-20 min wait. It's so horrible for any animal who just departed a 7-9 hr flight. Hopefully after enough pets relive themself on the carpets this airport will get smart and modern and build relief areas like all other airports where you can come and go without a gate agent. I alway cross my fingers I never have to travel through SLC but if your on Delta its a hard airport to avoid. Plus there are no signs to mark or inform you where the relief areas are so do your research.",-1,SLC
2017-08-30,0.7,Solo Leisure,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,,a fairly nice airport,False,"  Salt Lake City seems to have a fairly nice airport. My only complaint is the long walk to baggage claim from the B concourse on Terminal 1. Food options are somewhat limited compared to other airports. The place looked clean to me. The lines at check in looked rather long but the Southwest counter was adequately staffed. I was TSA Pre and that went quickly too. Another positive is the light rail line at the south end of Terminal 1. It took me from downtown to the Terminal in 23 minutes. It runs every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 20 minutes on Sundays and Holidays and is much cheaper than taking a cab or uber. It's not as pleasant as Long Beach or Jackson Hole, but it isn't the behemoth like Chicago O'Hare either.",1,SLC

Shuttle service for rental cars is getting worse and worse by the day. I have been traveling weekly to SMF and I can say the shuttle service has gotten worse by the day in the last six months. It used be couple of minutes wait to now it is over 20 minutes of wait with 100s of passengers waiting in shuttle line.

2022-02-05,0.4,Business,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,,,3.0,Budget lots more time for this airport,False,"  Budget lots more time for this airport, horribly inefficient. Taking the more difficult option of public transport (rental cars, etc.) is penalized by drop-off area furthest from each terminal. Rental car center requires dragging bags across lots, through building and then long wait on huge bus, only to be dropped off on outer land furthest from check-in! Maddening. If you miss turn-off to your terminal (no sign, only colors) be prepared for long delay as you drive miles to other terminal and terminal return. Why a smallish regional airport needs to be spread out over miles of terminal is difficult to comprehend. It’s one thing to have to significant transfer between terminals at London Heathrow (giant airport in urban area) it’s quite another at small regional. How about putting terminals together and allow passengers to access them without driving all over god’s green earth. Sorry for the rant but dragging heavy bags for 20 minutes at 5am needlessly requires some decompression.",-1,SMF

And dark red Jersey barriers in the middle of the road impossible to see which is bad cause 3 of us were driving around trying to find an exit. No signs. Then one tiny sign across the road, no lighting to direct you to the airport. Can’t see in dark and fog. Drove the wrong way, it is a two mile trip to a dead end to get back to the airport. Signs to rental cars as bad. Can’t see in fog which is common this time of year. Another 2 mile misdirection. Rental rental requires a bus. Train to terminal B ok but just be warned.

They are consistently rude and unnecessarily aggressive. I understand the importance of controlling traffic relative to departures and arrivals, however, it is unacceptable and unnecessary for these employees to be as rude and aggressive as they consistently are. I am wondering if these persons are hired with afore knowledge of their inability to perform their duties without any public service etiquette at all. I would rather travel to the South Bay Area to fly than to fly out of local Sac International in order to avoid having any encounters with these employees whatsoever.

It's not often that you encounter such exceptional customer service and genuine compassion in the service industry, but my encounter with two outstanding Huntleigh USA Corporation employees truly left me in awe. I found myself in a predicament when I was running late due to an unfortunate accident. Time was against me, and I was beginning to feel the stress and anxiety that comes with the fear of missing an important event. That's when Arlando Bolden and his colleague came to the rescue, turning my stressful situation into a heartwarming display of care and professionalism. Despite our best efforts, we arrived at our destination just a few minutes late. At this point, I had resigned myself to the possibility of missing my commitment, but Arlando and his coworker had other plans. They went above and beyond to ensure that I could still reach my destination. First and foremost, they helped me with the necessary arrangements, taking into consideration my convenience. This act of kindness was a relief in itself, but what truly touched me was their willingness to guide me personally. They recognized that my nerves were getting the better of me, and their calming presence made all the difference. Arlando Bolden deserves special recognition for his outstanding service and compassion. His dedication to his job and the well-being of customers is commendable. He was not just a helping hand but a beacon of support during a stressful moment. I am incredibly grateful to Arlando and his coworker for going the extra mile to ensure that I made it to my destination smoothly. Their actions exemplify the exceptional service that Huntleigh USA Corporation is known for, and I cannot thank them enough for their kindness. Huntleigh USA Corporation has earned my utmost respect and gratitude through this experience. They proved that they care deeply about their customers and are willing to do whatever it takes to make their journeys as pleasant as possible. I wholeheartedly recommend Huntleigh USA Corporation to anyone seeking reliable, compassionate, and customer-centric service.

Staff were efficient and seemed to actually care about their jobs, food and beverage options were plentiful, and the terminal was easy to navigate. The security process was also extremely efficient and well-staffed. The only negative thing I have to say about this airport is that the seating areas at the gates could have been cleaner, as chairs had dirt and particles of who knows what all over and in between them.

I just said “thank you for your help”. Then I get to security. The lady who checked my boarding pass and ID was nice compared to the baggage check staff member and the grumpy one pushing bags into the X ray machine. She had something nasty to say about everyone ahead of me as she tuned to put the trays back. A man 2 people in front of me got reprimanded for not pushing his stuff through. “That is your responsibility sir, not mine”, then she muttered “idiot” as she turned to put a tray back. The lady in front of me put her backpack in a tray and she pulled it out, yelled something at her, and said “what is wrong with you people, you got a bag you put it on with no tray! Sheeesh”. I put my bag on the rollers—and she grabbed a tray to put it in to send through. Then she told me to go to the line for the X-ray (of me), where I was asked to remove my shoes, my glasses, my Fitbit, my necklace (not an easy task with arthritis, but not only would nobody help, they were really impatient with the time it took me to get it off) and my scarf. I have never been asked to remove that much before as I have TSA precheck (they have you carry a card to let TSA know, but they took it away with my shoes so I didn’t have it for every time I had to take another piece of clothing off, but it’s but it didn’t matter to them.). They complained that I didn’t get out of the way fast enough when I had to go back. It seemed to be more about harassing the customers than safety anymore.

I followed and she dropped it just outside of the Security area and stormed off. I took it to baggage check and came back through Security where thank goodness she ignored me.

",False,"  
I like this airport. It's very clean and has friendly people. But it's really dragged down by the lack of decent food options in concourse C. With flights not serving meals, a traveler can come into the airport famished, with a short layover, and there's nothing. The only place to get a decent comfortable table is Chili's and the food there is simply awful. Plus the staff seem to find the back row of tables by the work station a great place to hang out and share raucous jokes. With five or six of them going at it on my last trip, you could hear them all down the concourse. Trying to pass a quiet hour with my laptop was wrecked by the noise, like being next to a tailgate party. And here's some feedback for the Chili's people. When I was there none of the shouting parties were watching the tables while we customers were craning our necks trying to get menus or drinks or whatever. I couldn't figure out why there were so many employees doing nothing except having fun in mid afternoon when there were very few customers, the cooks were making the food and the bartender was handling the bar. Just one waiter finally started handling tables and while he was very nice he forgot my silverware and water - separate trips for both - and seemed shaky on the whole process. The manager, whom I met briefly, seemed to have no clue that a restaurant, even Chili's, is supposed to serve customers, not double as a social club for staff. As a former restaurant owner, I ranked him as worthless. Anyway, we desperately need a pleasant place to sit with at least decent food that's not just tasteless Chili's fare, liquids, bready pre-made sandwiches or sugary pastries.",1,STL

I walked further down the terminal and came to 4 other drinking fountains. Nothing but a dribble came out. It was hard enough to get a sip of water but was impossible to fill up a bottle. This is ridiculous and leads me to believe you are forcing me to spend $3 on a bottle of water. It is time to update your fountains, first with ones that work and secondly with the bottle fillers that are offered in most 21st century airports.

The worst airport I have ever been to in my entire life. Our flight was delayed twice just like other airlines as well because for some odd reason the customs line was backed all the way out of the airport past Spirit’s outside check in. It was horrendous. The delayed flight didn’t really bother me because everyone was in the same boat. We arrived 3 hours and 20 minutes early and we literally needed all of that time. They said they were going to hold flights, but so many people missed their flights because of the ridiculous line. They made the process so confusing. If they had signs and warm and welcoming people in the front, it’ll be smooth-going. You’re literally scared to ask a question because they might bite your head off. It’s like, they have an attitude and make you feel dumb as if we are supposed to already know. People are asking questions because we’re all confused. Between customs and TSA, those were the rudest people I have ever met in my life. They were so mean and nasty to people. I felt so bad for the people they ridiculed and embarrassed in front of everyone. We met a guy in line that went through the 2 hour line before us, he went outside to get fresh air because it was so hot in the airport, and guess what? They literally made him go through the entire 2+ hour process all over again. Wow! I would’ve cried. When you’re coming into the island, it’s all welcoming and they have music playing, but when you’re leaving, it’s like the slums and feels so gloomy, dark, and depressing. The airport is already undeveloped, hot, and outdated, but can you imagine spending all this money during your vacation on this expensive island then, get treated like crap when we’re leaving? That was absolutely heartbreaking. I didn’t expect top notch service because a vast majority of people we met were not very nice outside of the airport, just on the island itself, but overall, I’ve never been so ready to get on a plane in my life. I will not recommend this vacation spot to anyone honestly. I’m glad I went and saw the beauty of the island especially the beaches, but the treatment these people give you, is just horrible.

Since Lopano took over, it has gotten progressively less customer-focused. Maybe Tiliocos, VP of Customer Service, has something to do with it? I emailed those two and the Feldman, head of parking. Obviously they got my emails, since Feldman, head of parking, called me to tell me personally to bugger off. Of the $5K for the trip, 45 is peanuts.

The only people security bothered to run through the wringer of special security checks are senior citizens and those needing assistance. I am on crutches and was told I should have been in a wheelchair because TSA did not provide chairs for someone like me to sit on to take their shoes off. I told them that I'd happily takes my shoes off if they could provide a chair. They didn't. Then after going through the xray they had to pat me down. Twice. And check for residue. Why the heck did I have to hobble through the xray without my crutches if I was going to get pat down anyway. Looking around as I was pat down, the ONLY people getting the special security treatment was senior citizens and persons like me. And on top of that they weren't even polite about it. Someone need to answer why those two groups are treated like this. I would understand it if they at least selected some random people or other demographic but for the 20 minutes it took me to go through security they did not once check anyone else and multiple times had people go through the regular walk through metal detector because the line was getting long. The whole ordeal was ridiculous. I rarely leave reviews so this is a whole level up of bad experiences.",-1,TPA

I will say that, what I call a Mall with shops and endless food options is fantastic. However the extremely high escalator is ridiculous and the distance you have to go with the tram and the speed at which it goes to the rental car location is way too far and too fast. I have anxiety and the speed is just waiting for a accident as it is way too jittery. And once you are their you have more to walk. I am not old but I did have major heart surgery but for elderly it is not passenger friendly to have to walk that much. This all makes me wonder about choosing a different airport or a different way to travel. I loved when the garage housed the rental cars. It was perfect. I would have kept the 1st and 2nd floor of the garage for car rentals and the top floors for passengers who kept their cars there.

From the drive into TPA, the airlines are cleverly color coded and then you are directed to either arrivals or departures. Then you simply have to look for the door with your airline. Once inside the main terminal, head to the appropriate ticket counter. If you have pre-checked in online, just take the air conditioned tram to your terminal (A–F). There you will go through security. There’s always ample TSA agents there to keep the crowd moving along securely and swiftly. Once through security, you are welcomed into a massive airy terminal. There’s plenty of food options from Cigar City Brewing (a popular craft beer producer in Tampa) to The Colombia Restaurant, a staple in Tampa since 1905 serving authentic Spanish fair. There’s plenty of workspace and outlets to charge up your devices. I flow the flow of this airport with plenty of signage. It’s almost impossible to get lost and everything is relatively closeby.",1,TPA

Overall it's still not bad but had a few red flags come up this time. Arrived in terminal E and used the men's washroom only to find the floor completely flooded (helps if you don't think too much about that). Fair enough, stuff happens. Except when we left a week later the same washroom still had a flooded floor. Seriously? Are there no plumbers in Tampa? Pretty disgusting. Check-in areas in the main terminal are starting to show their age. Trek to the car rental facility is a bit of an adventure. Up and down endless escalators plus a far from smooth train ride. Layout of the car rental area also seems to be an accident waiting to happen. Pedestrian walkways are not well defined and (in the case of Avis) cars were parked on the walkway back to the main building. Still gets a recommended grade but barely.",1,TPA

After landing, take the tram to the luggage area, get you bags, cross the street and pick up your rental car. The current set-up requires that after bag pick up - drag your luggage across the room, take an escalator up for 3 flights, drag your luggage to another tram,  ride a run away twisting bumping tram for at least 5 minutes to the car rental counters (at least 2 stops on the tram), drag your luggage to the rental counter, take the escalator down 2-3 flights, drag your luggage to another rental car counter to get the car keys, and finally drag your luggage to the car. This entire process took over 1:30 hours. My 1,000 mile flight from Newark to Tampa took 2:21 hours, my 5 mile track to the car rental took 1:30 hours. Suggest for future flights is to fly into Orlando and drive the 1 .5 hours from Orlando to Tampa",-1,TPA
2018-04-04,0.1,Family Leisure,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,a total disaster in terms of customer service,True," I have been traveling through this airport since the early 1980's. The airport was clearly well designed from the start with a central hub supporting multiple airsides via automated trams. The system worked and worked well for many years. After 911, the main long term parking terminal was closed and a remote long term parking garage was built away from the main terminal. It wasn't a great solution, but the shuttle buses ran quickly and delivered you right to the correct airside. Later, the original long term parking area was reopened with increased pricing. The new remote site was renamed ""economy parking"", though at $10 per day it was hardly economy. But that price was better than the $18 per day of the reopened long term garage. So, for many years I would park in the economy garage then ride the shuttle to the main terminal. From there I would check-in at curbside and take the tram over to my airside. Recently the airport has undergone major revisions which include a monorail system that joins the economy garage to the main terminal. Also, a new centralized car rental facility has been built which is next to the economy garage and also served by the monorail. The result is a total disaster in terms of customer service. I don't know who designed this mess, but I can tell they have no idea how to move people through an airport facility. First you must find parking in the economy garage, which isn't easy because the space inventory system is now broken. There used to be signs that would tell you how many spaces were on each floor. Apparently the new construction broke that system, so good luck finding a space. Next you have to take the elevator down to the first floor, even though the monorail is located on the 4th floor. Then, you drag your luggage to the middle of the garage road and jump on the moving floor system. Yes, they mounted the moving floor in the middle of the garage's shuttle roadway. Not on the sidewalk (where they have plenty of room), but right in the lowest part of the garage where surely the Florida rains will short circuit the machinery. The moving floor thing will slowly take you to the opposite side of the garage where a new elevator systems has been installed. Where next? No problem in deciding, there are only 2 floors to select. So now you go back up to the 4th floor to wait for the monorail. And wait, and wait. There appear to be only two trains and one was broken. Once on the train, prepare for a wild ride. First the train drops 4 floors and accelerates as it follows the access road to the main terminal. People and luggage fly about as the train dips and weaves at high speed. I'm sure injuries have already occurred due to this new system. As it approaches the main terminal, the train climbs quickly and stops abruptly at the station. If you've survived this far, you must now drag your luggage to the escalator for a trip down 3 floors. Now good luck finding your airline counter. If you're flying Southwest then you're in luck, it's the first one you find. Other airlines are scattered around and the signage isn't so good. Prepare for a lot of wandering around. Once you check-in, you now ride another escalator up and find that you are nowhere near your airside tram station. So, more walking to find the correct station and ride the tram over to your airside. In my case, the airside has been redesigned (which means less space and more expensive restaurants).",-1,TPA

The checking in and screening process are better than at most airports I know. One of the features of the airport I always enjoyed, was the availability of good restaurants, both in the terminal, before screening, and at the gate area. Last year the airport started to ""remodel"" the terminal and all of these nice restaurants were gone. I figured they would be back after the construction was over, but not only are they still doing construction a year later, the nice restaurants are gone, even in the gate area, and all they now offer is Chinese and fast food. They destroyed the whole pre-boarding experience, especially since you have to come to the airport early for your flight. The only place you can get a decent meal now, is in the airport hotel Marriott restaurant.",1,TPA
