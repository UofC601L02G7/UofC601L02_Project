2016-03-17,8,10,"""airport is well laid out""",N Wilson,"The airport is well laid out, the gates are simply marked, and the staff are extremely helpful. There is an information desk to the left of the entrance which will direct you where you need to go. Considering this was my first flight, and after having a head injury, they allowed my parents to go through security with me to guide me through the process. Security was slower than I have come to realize is usual and very confusing, however once on the other side, there were many shopping options, and also a great deal of eating options. There was suitable seating and the boards with times of departures were readily available. The bathrooms were a little messy however.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-10-21,8,10,"""always seems to be clean""",Cameron Tarbell,"Des Moines (KDSM) is an all round great airport. It is a very easy airport to navigate in and it doesn't take long to get through security at all. It always seems to be clean and free wifi is always a plus. While there seems to be a lack of shopping and food choices, there are a few that all seem to be good places of business. Terminal seating is in the process of being expanded as it doesn't hold the demand all of the time. It's a great airport to depart and arrive to. It isn't very big but will get you where you need to go.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
