2016-08-23,10,10,"""incredibly clean and attractive""",Haifan Day,"Dane County Regional is a cute little airport lying on the outskirts of Madison, and it has had some of the best services I have ever experienced at any airport. The airport is incredibly clean and attractive on the inside and the outside. This includes nice modern architecture on the outside, and mosaic flooring and stained glass handling lights. It may not have as many stores as other airports, but there is a store for nearly all travel needs, such as a Cafe, a restaurant, a travel store, and a Wisconsin Gear store. I also noted that there were multiple stores under construction. There are hardly any delays and MSN connects to nearly all large nearby airports, which provides excellent connection availability. The best part, was the incredibly fast Wifi, and charger ports in the waiting area.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-06-06,8,10,"""a fairly good airport""",B Chang,"This is a fairly good airport. Nice and clean, easy to get around. This airport is also very small and therefore has less wait time, thus you can probably get away with arriving only 1 hour prior to departure and still make your flight. On the other hand, there is not very many options to eat or shop.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
