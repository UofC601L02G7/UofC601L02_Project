2023-08-08,1,10,"""Complete waste of time""",M Phillips,"✅ Trip Verified | Convenient place to fly out of if they ever maintained their flight schedules. My past three flight out of this airport have been cancelled. When I ask why they make an excuse of weather, but it’s not delayed the flight is flat out cancelled. While all the other airports in the near area are fine DSW, MDW, O'Hare. Complete waste of time, no apologies, no alternative provided than roll the dice and come back tomorrow. Airlines used to work to get you out that day or even provide alternate airline solutions. You either rebook on an app, wait on a phone for 2+ hours, or get sent on your way at the counter. Word of advice if you actually want to get somewhere on the original day intended drive to Chicago or Detroit.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

A joke for this size airport! Management should be embarrassed!!

2022-01-01,8,10,"""Very clean and well taken care of""",Joseph Leonetti,"Not Verified |  Very clean and well taken care of. This airport is served by so many great airlines with diverse destinations. I do think that GRR needs more international routes. At GRR, the airport is not too big so it makes efficient travel. Also, they have a good selection of shops and stores. The airport facility looks really modern and cool for being over 55 years old. The only cons is that sometimes it can get a bit crowded and the staff doesn’t manage high groups of passengers well. Would give an 8.5 if I could.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2019-12-21,1,10,"""worst baggage claim ever""",N Delana ,"Not Verified |  The worst baggage claim ever. No signs to tell you where to go, what claim you need to use. Crowds just stand around and wait and bags to over an hour to come out. Worst ever.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'December 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-11-24,2,10,"""Terrible management""",Lloyd Whiting,"Not Verified | Terrible management of remodelling and on-property shuttles. I've traveled through numerous airports small to large some under construction, others remodelled. The remodelling of GRR's interior is taking years and is painful to navigate and claim luggage there are 2 carousels for all the airlines and flights. Further, there is no room for all the passengers who have no clue where one's bags are coming. With regard to the parking shuttle - there was too little capacity. As I knew there were more people waiting for the shuttle than its capacity; I started walking to the economy lot. I made it before the shuttle (which I only saw arriving in the lot as I was leaving! The people are nice though.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-08-25,1,10,"""Avoid this place at all costs""",T Lau,"Not Verified |  August 2019 was my first time using this airport and I will never use it again. Security staff is hands down the worst I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. The most misserable people I have ever met in my life with a goal of ruining your day. I will never use this airport again just because of them. Huge inflated egos with a badge. Avoid this place at all costs, trust me.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-01-12,8,10,"""Employees are friendly and helpful""",Nick Shadoff,"✅ Trip Verified | I fly weekly for work, and Gerald R. Ford Int'l Airport in Grand Rapids is one of my two home-base airports. It's served by American, Delta, United, Southwest and Allegiant, and has non-stop flights to twenty-something destinations. I primarily fly American, and mostly take flights that connect through Chicago O'Hare or Dallas/Fort Worth. GRR is a larger regional airport, with two concourses of 8 gates each, but not a large airport by any means. I can park in the garage, walk in, clear security (TSA Pre-Check) and walk to my gate within 15 minutes of driving into the garage. I love that kind of convenience. Employees are friendly and helpful pretty much across the board -- at the airline counters, security and at the gates. GRR recently finished a fairly large renovation, in late 2017. They now have one central security checkpoint, and a central area with new shopping and dining, including a local brewpub, Starbucks and a Michigan-themed souvenir shop, There are also new lounge areas, children's play area and a business center, not to mention new, large restrooms. In general, GRR operates on time, which is key for me. Most delays I've experienced have come from aircraft delayed at their originating airport - mostly O'Hare. I'm basically comfortable relying on this airport for my weekly business travel needs.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-06-19,10,10,Grand Rapids Airport customer review,S Fortes,Great little airport all staff friendly and helpful. Security checks speedy and done with a smile. Could some of the staff be used to show other airports how it is done.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-08-07,3,10,Grand Rapids Airport customer review,K Cameron,Friendly little airport which stinks of burned toast from a bagel vendor. They really ought to get the vendor to install a ventilator hood. The faux jazz piped in everywhere is also a poor choice. The CNN monitors are loud but not as bad as some. I've been here a while because of the lousy service and rigid rules of Delta Airlines so this is a well-considered review.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-01-31,3,10,Grand Rapids Airport customer review,Cristiano Miro,Living in South Florida and used to departing from and connecting through massive airports GRR was a breeze. Now the new parking-building is fully functional (and beautiful it is all in a natural colour of brown). The check-in area it-self is nothing to admire and very basic. Than you walk-up to a short-ramp and there you are: Steps away from all the terminals. This area does have a small food-courts with the basic pizza/burger fare. It also has floor-to-ceiling windows bringing in plenty of natural light. GRR had a major problem: its airfare were outrageously expensive: even the discounted ones. However after low-cost Allegiant started servicing Grand Rapids tickets prices dropped dramatically - even last- minute ones! This can only bring more business to West Michigan.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
