I have never walked as much as I have in an airport as I have here. The shuttle bus process is really bad. Driving in a fully loaded bus with NO air is un excusable. The two tiny windows that were letting a tiny bit of air were not enough. We ended up sitting on the bus for a good 4 or 5 minutes while we waited for 3 Southwest planes to pass. When the last jet went by and started throttling up we got a nice HOT blast of the smell of jet fuel.  I can't say that I won't be back, but we may change airlines so we don't need to endure the poorly planned annex wing.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

So because adults couldn't plan ahead and get to the airport with plenty of time for their flight, we were the ones that had to stand there and wait for them.

We proceeded to use priority lane but got so far and it was closed. There was a few of us and we had to join the end of the queue. One of the gentlemen asked a TSA agent what was happening with security. She was extremely rude and dismissive of him. So much for friendly and helpful staff!

My kids were in town and I had to take them to the airport for the return flight home. They are Minors so I went in with them to make sure they got on board the plane ok. I parked in the parking garage for less than 2 hours and was charged a full 1 day rate of 26 dollars. That rate kicks in at 45 minutes. I believe that is absurd. I don't have a problem paying to park but don't feel like I should have had to pay the full day rate. Don't get me wrong it isn't that I don't have the funds but it really the principle of it. I usually park off site because the rates are better and the shuttle service is better as well. I feel the full day rate shouldn't kick it until about 3 or 4 hours in the garage. I mean if you parked and took a flight somewhere it would take 3 to 4 hours to get there and back without really getting off a plane.

I know it is important to try and keep traffic going so it doesn’t back up. What I don’t agree with is being rude while doing it. Everyone is there to do the same thing.

Al this to serve hundreds of people that are waiting to see if their flights will be cancelled or not.

The Airport has only 1 Defreezer truck. It can de freeze 1-2 planes then has to go refuel, which takes 2 hrs. So, we were waiting for our turn to be defreezed. After about 20 min, the pilot gave us an update saying that the defreezer has a malfunction and the tech is coming to fix it. A little later, we got an update that said: well, I can see that there is only 1 person loading the luggage’s, so this may take a little while before we can even move the plane. In the meantime, we are still waiting on the update for the defreezer. A few minutes later, the pilot says we just found out that the mechanic is on his way and should be there in about 30 min. Damn.

The Berry Bistro is the only option on the Southwest terminal side to get any sort of coffee that’s to go other than Starbucks. Starbucks takes over 20 minutes because they are the only ones with reliable options. The Berry Bistro two weeks ago was closed because no staff showed up to work in the am. Today (like 3 other times) they’ve had our order wrong, over charged us and then didn’t have the items they said they did. When we asked for a refund they couldn’t because they didn’t have a manager to approve so they had to get change out of their wallets to refund us. All the other food options in the court area have cold food, even in the warmers, the staff can’t speak English.

Most agents have an entitlement attitude, Nashville Airport TSA was excellent, something I've never experienced in an US airport. The staff were nice, the airport to was clean, and they had live music to ease you. Nashville you're doing it right, everyone seems to be happy - as a traveler I left as content as I arrived.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'December 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2009-03-21,4,10,Nashville Airport customer review,C Maddox,This airport has made huge improvements over the past few years with shops and dining. My trips have always been trouble free with a short line in security. But unless your flying with Southwest you are probably going to have to change planes.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-11-19,4,10,Nashville Airport customer review,Chris Mitchell,One of the most convenient airports if you're renting a car. Car return is immediately adjacent to the terminal. You'll be at the ticket counter within 5 minutes walk after dropping off your rental car. Security line a bit long on most recent trip but it was the Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving. Airside is excellent - no long taxi or ground waits due to traffic (unless its a hold due to the destination) at BNA. Just wish there were more nonstop flights to west coast.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
