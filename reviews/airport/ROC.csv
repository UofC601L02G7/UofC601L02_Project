2010-06-30,4,10,Greater Rochester Airport customer review,W Burke,This is my home airport. Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised. I had the entire security checkpoint to myself no other passengers ! This was incredibly lucky on my part. There are no VIP or First class lounges here. Rochester is a place people arrive at or depart from there are virtually no layovers here. This is not an overly busy airport. Taxi times are short and the runway never gets stacked up. I heartily endorse the Red Osier's Prime Rib Sandwiches shop airside too. The only drawback in my opinion is a dearth of ground transportation options taxi rent a car or RTS bus. RTS busses don't run very often and travel through one of the worst neighborhoods in the city on their way downtown.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-01-08,4,10,Greater Rochester Airport customer review,Chris Smith,Small regional airport. With just two terminals it is pretty painless to navigate. Lines at the security checkpoint move fast. I was told that a contractor operates the checkpoints. In my experience staff was friendly and two or more lanes were open. Some restrooms in the secure area were closed off due to renovations in progress. Concessions were limited but there is a McDonald's a Subway a news store and a coffee outfit. Because it's a regional airport many code share flights are operated by smaller airlines flying commuter aircraft. If you're not a fan of turboprop aircraft avoid Piedmont Air operating as US Air Express on DHC 8 planes.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
