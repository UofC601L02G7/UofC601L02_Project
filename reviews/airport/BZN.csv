The concourse is easy to maneuver and the directional signs are very helpful and easy to read. Security is usually a breeze on days with less travel. Bozeman does have TSA PreCheck. The seating areas are nice with stations for charging, Internet Access is also free, but it may not work on some devices. The terminal is spotless, and there are many little shops to have a coffee in as well as a Yellowstone Association store which offers in-depth information about visiting Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and the surrounding areas.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
