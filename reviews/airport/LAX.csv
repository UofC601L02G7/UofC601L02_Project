We started to panic and frantically looked for him for him all over the airport. We asked a few LAX employees where we could possibly find him. They shrugged and acted like they didn't care. None of them got on their phones or walkie-talkies to communicate with each other. We also informed a customer service agent behind a glass booth and told him we couldn't find my father. He was unhelpful and wouldn't go on a public speaker to page my father. After over an hour, we randomly found my father at an Alaska Airlines counter.

We were instructed, by another TSA agent, to find any open space for the bins and use it. A couple in front of us obviously didn't know how this TSA worked, and neither did I, in addition, to taking their time and holding up the line. In the mean time, the older women TSA agent wasn't paying attention and was making small talk with the couple. I had already placed items in 2 bins, and stacked another because she wasn't paying attention and her male co-worker was giving my mom (who was unable to move bins because of surgery) instructions to put a heavier suitcase in a bin. The way the luggage line is set up, there is a divider and the TSA agent has to pull the bins from the customer side to allow them to move toward the xray area on their side to create space. I attempted to maneuver the bins and then waited, but there was still no space in front of me, so I took one of the two spaces that the  couple was not using, because the older TSA agent wasn't paying attention. The TSA agent then gets an attitude with me and tells me that I took the white woman's space that was in front of her; but, the woman of the couple had 2 spaces without bins and she was holding up the line and I needed to get to my flight. So I proceeded to tell the TSA agent that I was helping my mother because he coworker was instructing my mother to put items in a new bin and rushing her along and my mother wasn't able because of her arm, and I asked her, since she wasn't moving the bins in front of me to create space, what did she expect me to do, and she stated to ""hold it (the bin)!"" Really?! I attempted to explain to her that her coworkers instructions and her instructions were conflicting and that I was trying to help my mother. She continued to go back and forth with me. The male coworker was apologetic after we told him of my mother's condition, but the older agent continued to be rude, which caused me to also respond. This could have been resolved if the TSA agent was paying attention and moving the bags along and instructed the female to place her items in one of the spaces and allow me to place my items in the other space. The couple continue to talk about me and the situation and my mother became upset because they were saying I was mean and inconsiderate but that couldn't have been furthest from the truth. The situation only escalated after the couple, along with the TSA agent, continued to be inconsiderate of others trying to make their flights.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'February 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

The disability services had been arranged for each leg and when I mentioned my predicament the staff were just absolutely amazing. Firstly the lady who name I can’t remember got me through customs and bag pickup in minutes, handed me over to a waiting disability transfer van she had called ahead for. Once in the international terminal a gentleman by the name of Lyn made a personal effort to get me through all the check points radioing ahead to let all staff know he had a passenger whose flight was boarding. Once through all checks he got me on a golf cart and raced me to my gate. Without the tremendous kindness and effort of these staff members I wouldn’t have made it. I made an extra effort to be courteous, kind, thankful and called everybody by name. It’s amazing how far people will go if you are actually thankful and polite.

LAX is generally a good airport, the arrival area is nice until you get to the immigration area. It is small and some of the screens were glitching. It seemed tatty too. After an 11-12 hour flight, it isn't the best thing waiting for an hour and a half in the queue either. Having said that, the vibe was calm and staff seemed organised with the queue system. None of the staff were rude or pushy. Signage could be improved for arrivals. There is a nicely lit and futuristic tunnel once you've cleared immigration and you can take a shuttle bus to LAX-it (their Uber/Lyft stand). Great idea but too expensive! Very disappointed that there isn't a metro/train service yet, being from the UK. I am aware that in late Autumn 2022, there will be a people mover connecting out from LAX. The Departures is very nice. Like Arrivals, the staff are organised. However, it is easy to quickly get through and to get to Airside. Airside feels a lot like Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar; think of it as a compliment LAX! The shops are generally good, however, food options could be better.

There is an area on the other side of the wall of the room that has tables but all the media plugs have been purposely covered, so no phone plugs.

With that being said, I am still a customer and expect a certain standard of customer service.  First we walk in and have already checked in online so no need to go to the kiosks. My father and I walk over to go through TSA. A gentleman asks to see our boarding pass. This ain’t where they scan the boarding pass by the way. So my father shows him his boarding pass on his phone and the gentleman walks away from us. A few seconds later he walks over to us and in a raised tone asks to see my boarding pass. So my father shows him my boarding pass on his phone. The gentleman proceeds to tell us in a raised and non-neutral tone that why would we think to not to shows the other pass. Okay, I get your point but isn’t it unprofessional to speak to people that way. AND you didn’t even look at the boarding pass. So we go in line, ignoring the guy still ranting to us and go to scan out boarding passes. The names were switched for our seats and were showing up wrong on the phone and his scanner. Instead of being patient and working with us to see what was wrong, he rolls his eyes and says “my computer says something different so I can’t let you pass”. Again, totally understand that is a rule that you must follow. However, there’s no need to roll your eyes because we are just as confused as you. We the. Go through TSA. What an absolute mess. Everything is so backed up by the continue to let people go through. So after you go through the scanner you need to wait in line AGAIN to get your belongings. And by wait in line I mean for 5 minutes. Doesn’t seem like a long time but ideally it should take one minute for my belongings to be checked after I have been scanned. There are workers standing around chatting it up instead of helping their coworkers. What kind of team is that? I just don’t understand what kind of place would allow their workers to speak to customers in those tones. Now, it’s not like we raised our voices first. I’m all for customer service employees to stand up for themselves when being disrespected. No one should have to put up with that. However, we never raised our voices or put blame onto the workers yet we were disrespected because? Don’t forget those workers who are doing their job.

Then went through security to find, surprise, surprise, I was in the worng terminal. There is no information desk airside, eventually had to accost some maintenance workers who kindly made some calls to direct me to the correct terminal. Why this was so hard is incompletely beyond comprehension. Note, I had checked in at the time if my first leg, so gate details were not on my boarding pass. Eventually got to the gate to find people flayed across the ground - for some reason the gate had no seats. By this stage the overwhelming incompetency became comical and I had a good laugh.

Suffice it to say, Los Angeles Airport - for a world class destination - is firmly cemented in a 3rd world class reputation. If you can avoid the LAX Los Angeles Airport - do so - it is like a Plague. Its not like me to criticize without offering resolutions. Disney. Universal Studios.

2019-03-25,3,10,"""crowded, dirty and poorly planned""",Marilyn Zaruba,"Not Verified | We are elderly and I use a cane. I have been diagnosed with severe degenerative disk disease and cannot walk very far at a time. We set out from a domestic terminal at one end of the airport to the international terminal. We had our suitcases in a cart and kept asking employees which way to go. When we reached the end of the building, I asked a group of chatting employees how to reach the international terminal for our flight to Singapore. The female of the group said to go outside and walk about ten minutes and we would be there. She could see my cane, there is no doubt we are elderly and that my husband was pushing a large cart of four suitcases. I asked if that was the only way since it was raining outside and she smiled and said yes. She gave us no indication that there are shuttle buses for travelers so we started walking. It might be 10 minutes for a young person, but it took us at least 30 minutes. Time was not a problem, exhaustion was. We finally made it to the international terminal where there are very few seats...maybe one per 50 passengers. Our airline counter was not yet open so we stood and waited as seats became available. After a couple of hours, I needed to find a restroom which was a very long walk from where we were. No seats and no restrooms. Once we checked in, we were told that it was a very long way to our gate. That was an understatement. Our airline, Singapore Airlines, was the last gate at the farthest end of that terminal. We walked and rested and walked and rested. We were passed up by many carts carrying people. How are you supposed to get a cart? I had asked before we flew if we could get them and was told you just had to happen upon them. We never did, but others sure did. Later I realized that many people waited at the plane upon exiting and the carts were brought to them yet I was told this could not be done for us. The capper to all of this was when we were finally allowed to board, we were taken out into the rain and very strong wind to a bus, from the bus, we climbed stairs onto our plane. I felt like I was back in primitive 1970s Iran. Upon our return, we had a very tight connection and had to get from the international terminal to a domestic terminal. The first employee I saw when we deplaned was a nice man who handed us two orange express connection passes. We took those and rushed for our baggage so we could go thru customs before boarding a domestic flight. We thought those passes would help, but they served no purpose whatsoever. We went to the back of the line just like everyone else. They would have signs directing us to the express connection lines, but they were no faster than regular lines. At least this time I found a kind employee who told us there were shuttle buses we could take to the domestic terminal. That was very helpful, but we rushed as fast as we could and were told there was no way we could make our flight. We will never go thru LAX again. Why no help for disabled travelers? Why do you have to go outside to another terminal? Visit Changi airport in Singapore to see a truly amazing airport. They have lounges you can sleep on, free foot massage machines, clean restrooms, lots of seating, helpful employees and even a nature walk. Even the tiny airport in Dunedin, NZ, is better organized and cleaner than LAX. LAX is crowded, dirty and poorly planned.

We reached the automatic scanning machines reasonably quickly but then were made to join another queue which spiralled around the arrivals hall, it took 2 hours to reach the manned desk where we were obliged to undergo repeat fingerprint and photography. Why twice for passengers who are only waiting for a plane to be serviced during a 2 hour transit? All that our airline staff could do was to call out that the plane would wait for us! I was then subjected to aggressive questioning around the item which I was legitimately carrying as documented, checked in luggage safely stowed in the hold of the aircraft. Officers threatened that they would unload my luggage for inspection and I would be forced to miss my flight. My passports were confiscated during this process and I was made to wait on the border with no id documents. Three officers discussed this between themselves, none of them asked me for the documentation and I was treated like a criminal. When their supervisor finally arrived after about 20 minutes of this she instructed them to let me go and board the plane which was by this time waiting for me.

LAX should be ashamed of themselves, treating your customers like cattle. The stress of arriving to (and from) the airport (and it's not just the new construction). Cattle going to the slaughter house are treated more humanely than the unfortunate people who frequent LAX airport. The only slight relief was the refreshment area which lasted one second till he told me the price of a bottle of water. Shame on you. Were we paying for all that excessive marble and advertising glitz in Arrivals? (Thats a whole different complaint). You should be looking at how other airports address the traffic. Barcelona for one, who separate the buses, shuttles, taxis etc from the cars. Its a great stressless experience. Great unassuming restaurants that you pay reasonable prices, shops that cater to the masses instead of the wealthy. Your mantra seems to be grab as much money as you can from the unsuspecting victims and then wait for them to complain. Shame, shame on you. The employees are miserable and rude, not a smile or welcome from any of them. Being shuttled like cattle to the airplane in a miserable over crowded bus. Shame shame. Look at Gatwick airport, where they have a hotel in the airport for early morning travelers, where they have a train station that is an elevator floor away from check in. Stressless and a great experience. LAX is a stressful money grabbing people barking orders mass of confusion. Hateful experience. I would like my money back for the excessive price of the bottled water. Shame. When I return I will no doubt have a horrible experience but when I glance at the marble and the glitz of the advertising my thought would be ""why did they spend the money on this instead of finding a way to eliminate the lines, the traffic, the confusion, the miserable employees, the expensive shops and the the most unwelcome airport ever.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

There is a huge traffic jam getting to and from these flights, with passengers waiting up to 20 minutes to even board a short bus. The annex terminal has few services, with only a small deli for food. They do have a lounge out there, but were not selling day passes that day, due to construction at the lounge in another concourse.

The nightmare started after I entered the LAX international terminal, The first bad experience was the baggage carousel, which was going to handle my flights luggage, broke down. They waited for 30 minutes before deciding to bring my flights luggage through another carousel. This was putting catching my new connecting flight at risk. I finally got my checked luggage, cleared customs and was directed to the connecting flights area. After another 30 minute wait, my luggage was checked in on a Delta Airlines flight and instead of a boarding pass, given an A4 piece of paper and told curtly to go to terminal 2. At the crowded terminal 2 I was curtly told by terminal 2 staff to use one of the check in kiosks. The kiosk would not accept the information on the sheet of paper. Luckily some Qantas passengers, who were in the same predicament as me found someone who finally gave me my boarding pass. I finally got to the boarding gate with 10 minutes to spare.

Staff are offish and ineffective. My 14 year old daughter was pulled for an immigration check and we nearly missed our connecting flight as we were sat in a waiting room for 2 hours. In that area, 2 people worked running the checks, one person sat on the front desk taking passports and handing them on, another “supervisor” sat and watched the TV and two more (maybe security) wandered around the waiting room occasionally in between sitting down watching TV and napping. One man was told by the lady at the desk to stand by the vending machine, a while later he was shouted at by another staff member for standing there and told to stand in the other corner. He said that’s where he was told to stand so she shouted “well now I’m telling you to stand over there ao you go stand over there” Even if it’s a connecting flight, LAX require all luggage to be picked up and then taken to another area for it to be checked in to the final destination. This makes LAX a poor choice for connecting flights. Toilets very dirty landside but better airside. The security screening is moderately rapid but there are no signs up to explain what should be done (shoes off, liquids in a bag etc) which means it’s mainly managed by staff yelling at the guests - usually with conflicting instructions.

I'm embarrassed this is in America, I'm dumbfounded that people are so blatantly rude, and I'm ashamed of their lack of compassion and common courtesy.

At first, I was very pleasantly surprised at the immigration lines. The wait was much less than expected, the terminal is new and beautiful, lots of staff to direct travelers. But then the nightmare started: I was already prepared that my luggage would not make it because of a severe delay in arrival when connecting in Frankfurt, Germany. Frankly, I was completely at ease with that, I didn't mind, it is not the first time this has happened, and I usually pack accordingly. However, for some reason there was a delay in delivering everyone's luggage that did make it, to baggage claim. No biggie, I thought, I had 2.5 hours to connect after clearing immigration! There were multiple announcements overhead where they apologized for the delay in delivering the bags, that there was more luggage waiting to be delivered, and to absolutely not leave without the luggage as it would not be transferred automatically. Meanwhile, 1.5hours later, Aeroflot luggage arrived at the same carousel, not one announcement that the remaining Lufthansa luggage would be taken off the carousel on one end of the thing, or that there would not be anything else coming. I started to get nervous because we were now entering the time frame where I might have trouble connecting to my last leg (approx 45 min to go before departure) and asked for the tenth time, what the plan was. Finally someone found out that there was no further luggage to be had, and to start heading for my connecting gate. Lines through customs were nearly a (felt) mile by now. Luckily I was able to use the much shorter Global Entry lines. Then came the shocker. Since I had no luggage to be rechecked, because it didn't make it, a customer service representative directed me to my connecting flight. ""Leave the terminal and hang a right to Terminal 7"" he said. I left, only to turn around because there were no good signs where terminal 7 even was. He did not offer any further instructions. I started running/walking to Terminal 7. During the 20min it took to get to Terminal 6 there was not one single bus that passed me. I ended up hopping on the bus to take me to the last terminal, because I was running out of steam. And I don't consider myself unfit! Now at Terminal 7, I had to go through security again. Mind you, with all that until now, if I had not been able to take advantage of TSA Precheck, I would not have made my connection because on top of that the gate was the second to last in this Terminal as well.

The first time thru, outgoing to Sydney, was not too bad. I dismissed the 45 minute walk to my connecting flight as a good prep for my upcoming 16 hr nonstop flight. Coming back into the US, left me confused, angry, even embarrassed to be an American. Long story short, it took me 2 hours to go thru immigration and get to my gate. Improper signage, unhelpful clueless employees. I saw workers openly arguing and disagreeing with one another, to the astonishment of all of us travelers. People who are stationed and paid to help people are distant, busy socializing with other employees and intentionally ignoring, yelling at, belittling the travelers coming into our country. Only because I'm American and speak English did I make it thru in 2 hours. So many traveling foreigners wandering around lost, begging for help and getting none. The rest of the story is the layout. I walk every day for my health and enjoyment. But this was something else. The long subterranean passageways that were obviously built for maintenance and never intending to cattle people thru are the main arteries of LAX. These run under the runways where all planes are actively taking off and landing. Moving walkways anyone? When you get to the end of the long, concrete, unattractive hallways there are no signs telling where to go, where to turn, nothing. Overhearing 50% of the walkers were backtracking and lost. I witnessed people taking breaks halfway because it was so far. I could have handled the walk, had it not been for the two employees who told me the wrong way to go. Also, no charging stations. During my 2 hr tour thru this disaster, I saw no charging stations for our devices. I will pay anything to avoid this airport at any time in the future. As a reference, I have been thru immigration at other foreign countries and my recent experience with Australia had me thru customs in 10 minutes. From landing to driveaway in 20-25 minutes.

The airport is very badly organised with a long trek from the International Terminal to the domestic. Good luck finding a shuttle bus. The process for transfer of luggage from International to a domestic flight is physically demanding and time consuming. There seem to be queues to join queues. There is some crazy system whereby the arriving plane has to wait for a loading bay to become vacant. This took 20 minutes. Perhaps the airport has just had too many demands put on it.

2016-05-01,3,10,"""line for security was so long""",J Newcombe,"✅ Verified Review |  I have traveled throughout the world, through many airports, so in saying that, I want this feedback to be as objective as possible. On April 27th I flew home to Australia from LAX. The line for security was so long, I had to queue through watching many people frustrated as they were held up for flights that were about to board or were boarding. May I make one very useful recommendation? Have a priority queue at security, for all the passengers whose flights are currently boarding. Other airports around the world do this, and have airport staff pointing those quests that are on a flight that is currently boarding, to the priority queue. It works well and efficiently and will eliminate the sudden rush of passengers who are trying to get through the long security line to their flights – which in turn will reduce the amount of delayed flights that are moving out of your airport. As mentioned, this method works in other airports around the world, and I believe can be successfully administered at LAX. Other passengers who have ample time for the security queue will not mind those passengers who are about to miss a flight, to move to a priority queue which is solely for guests who are on a flight that is currently boarding. I understand the budget cuts have affected the airport but this is a simple method that does not require extra staff but is better management of the current staff allocations. I, along with many other quests, were very disappointed at the nonchalant nature of the staff at LAX who showed no sense of urgency, empathy or even concern for those passengers whose flights were about to leave.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Though it looks like they're working on the facilities it still falls far behind other airports in the area, particularly as it has no public transportation like a people mover or link to subways. Other problems are dirty facilities, poor lighting, luggage retrieval that sometimes takes up to a half an hour to 45 minutes. The driving in and out of the airport is just a nightmare. There's no central facility for car rental or hotels and buses practically crowd out all other vehicles. At most other major airports there are separate lanes for pick up by cars and livery services as well as buses; but at LAX they all crowd into one lane - it's crazy!

I have seen many cars parked at the curb waiting for passengers to arrive. This area is supposedly for ""immediate"" passenger loading and not just a convenient spot to park and wait. The traffic gets very congested because cars that are there to pick up waiting passengers cannot get to the curb so they have to stop in the drive lanes for their passengers to load their luggage and enter the vehicles. This results in all traffic around the arrivals loop to be congested and slow and creates a safety hazard with passengers walking in the drive lanes.

2015-08-19,1,10,Los Angeles LAX Airport customer review,Laura Preble,"As an arriving US citizen, I had to go through 3 checkpoints that were within 20 yards of each other yesterday. First, the automated passport scanners, which we were all forced to use despite the fact that all the employees working to 'help' with them admitted that they did not work well. Then we were all funnelled into a line where we waitied for 1.5 hours for a customs agent to look at our papers and the tickets printed out at the kiosks 10 feet away. There were a total of 2 agents working the line I was in. Finally, there was one more 'Exit Control' check point not 10 yards from the second check point. No one who works there that I met had any idea why it was this way. They just shrugged and said, 'that's just the protocol', which seems to be the default response to anything. I spent far less time getting into the UK and I'm not a citizen there.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-08-07,1,10,Los Angeles LAX Airport customer review,R Pathak,"My experience was terrible at LAX, the check-in staff were unwelcoming. There were hardly any shops and restaurants we had to walk through a construction area to get to gate. The airport was dirty, noisy and crowded. When we got to the gate we didn't get on the flight since we were traveling standby and the flight was full. Unluckily the next flight to New York was at 8 am and it was 11 pm so we had to spend the night at LAX. They gave us pillows and blankets because the terminal was freezing. At 8am we also didn't get on so we had to try the next flight which was a Delta flight (we were trying United). It was a 20 minute walk to the Delta terminal, we had to walk through another construction area. The Delta terminal was much nicer and had a selection of shops and restaraunts.

2015-07-29,9,10,Los Angeles LAX Airport customer review,Vadim Berman,"When traveling from Australia, the only two options to enter and leave the US are LAX and SFO. LAX is closer. This time was first in a long time, since 2009, and what a pleasant surprise! In 2009, it was indeed a dump. Old equipment, everything was dirty, the immigration was a race against time. In July 2015 I couldn't recognise the place. The immigration had automatic kiosks working with Aussie passports, and the border control had more people. The XXI century finally arrived to their security, no more need to remove the shoes. The terminal where Qantas was, had a decent selection of food. The terminals have been renovated, were clean, sparkling, and equipped with automatically flushing toilets. Of course, it's still chaotic and too crowded but it is no longer a chore to visit.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Big, messy, badly signposted and facilities are almost non-excistant. Nevermind the shopping, but it would be nice to have a decent meal. Terminal 4 restaurants were small, way too full and awfully noisy. There was 25 minute wait at the pizza place. Food was overly expensive compared to the quality and portion size. There wasn't enought seats at the gate. To be precise there wasn't enough room anywhere. There was no place to relax and chill out before being stuck on the plane for hours.

2015-06-24,3,10,Los Angeles LAX Airport customer review,A Allen,"My first visit to the International Terminal. Sad to say LAX struck out badly. Entered Passport Control area around noontime, there were people in red uniforms directing USA travelers to the automated passport kiosks. Another person in a red uniform said many of the kiosks in this row were down. So why didn't the person directing me to use them know this? An utter fiasco. As I left to the real person passport check line, people in red were arguing among themselves as to which machines were working, which were not.  Went downstairs to baggage claim and another fiasco. Baggage carousels had signage showing all the arriving international flights, but no information as to which carousel to go for your flight's baggage. Master baggage carousel sign on the wall listed all the flights. Again no information as to which carousel to use. Over the PA system, a hard to hear voice gave out the information on where to go for your baggage. No information saying area was being upgraded, work in progress or under repair. Or is this just the daily standard for LAX? Went to my terminal gate for connecting flight. Saw a snack area offering small, thin sandwiches and drinks.  I guessed an overpriced $5-6 for one.  I about choked when I was told they sell for over $11 each. Funny how retail stores must have a price shown for every item while LAX hasn't got a clue. I have to give LAX credit for the connecting flight baggage handling drop-off as you leave the International area. Finally an efficient area with someone in charge who knows how to do their job. Person in charge of this area, takes pride in it. Can't say the same for the three areas above.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2015-06-17,3,10,Los Angeles LAX Airport customer review,Edward Chui,"Arrived and transferred to domestic here twice. In both occasions, immigration was a nightmare. The last thing I would want after a 13 hour Trans-Pacific flight is to stand in a queue that was barely moving. Not to mention the stern faced immigration officers. Hoped to connect to wifi during the wait but that never happened until I was in the carousel hall. Through immigrations and into the carousel hall, I waited half an hour for my bags to arrive. I had to go from the international terminal to the domestic Southwest terminal for my flight to Phoenix. The shuttle bus took forever to arrive and the trip was stupid long. Departure back home was slightly more pleasant. Airside had far more eating options and the wifi there was brilliant. Comfortable and ample seating in the gate holding area and the gate staff were surprisngly friendly compared to the robots in arrival.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2014', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-06-11,1,10,Los Angeles LAX Airport customer review,N Gibson,"Over the years, I have had the misfortune to fly into or out of LAX, and (silly me), I keep expecting it to get better.  I will tell you the first time I flew out of LAX was in the early 1960's, when I was six years old, and, to my recollection, it was a pretty neat, modern place.  But that really was long ago, during the age of Boeing 707's, and fewer travelers going in and out of that place.  Last week, the first thing I noticed after entering Terminal 2 were the incredibly rude TSA personnel.  One wonders, is their job really so horrible?  I guess I just answered my own question, they work at LAX, so it must be!  After getting through security, one enters a series of hot, ugly corridors with walls covered in plastic sheeting.  Yes, they are busy renovating, but you would think there would be a nicer way to do this.  Then by the time we get to the waiting area for our Hawaiian Airlines A330 aircraft, we are so disappointed to see a waiting room with nary enough seats for everyone.  Thus, many people, including me, end up sitting on the dirty carpet.  I am not opposed to sitting on the floor on a nice, clean tatami mat in Japan, but sitting on the dirty LAX carpet that dirty shoes have traipsed over for years? Disgusting!  Evidently, the air conditioning is not working properly during the renovation either.  It was hot, and I just kept having the thought that I really wasn't in one of the major cities of America.  One would expect this in a third world country.  But at a major port of entry into the United States?  I think it is a shameful way to greet international, or even American travelers.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by major airports in China, Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan, but it scares me to think that if an airport is the first impression many people get of a country, what are people to think of us after they've been through LAX?  What are we to think of ourselves? Needless to say, I will avoid this airport if I can in the future.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-06-11,7,10,Los Angeles LAX Airport customer review,Viviane Topp,"I am delighted that there are so many passport scanners to process entering citizens.  However the lines were backed up because the officers did not guide the passengers to the scanners that they could not see were not in use. Yes passengers have to be assisted in how to use the scanners. There were officers doing that, but there were several just in lala land. There has to be a system telling the citizens that there were empty scanners. So the line was long and the scanners that were no visible to the waiting passengers went unused.   So either train the officers to tell the awaiting passengers that there is an empty scanner or give the scanners a number and when empty the passengers can go. Just observe and see if I am right.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
