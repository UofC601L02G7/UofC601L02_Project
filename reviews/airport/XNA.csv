Your ID, put your bag, take your bag were his only words. No greeting, no thank you, no have a good flight. I recently moved to Fayetteville for a job from New York. Flying often. Never flew from Fayetteville, used Raleigh for that. There was no soap in the restroom at 8 am already. Security was okay, did not use thank you or please in their lexicon. I will fly from Raleigh next time.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-05-27,10,10,"""I am definitely impressed""",K Phillips,"âœ… Trip Verified | Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport may be the best small/medium airport in the United States. In spite of being a regional airport in a small state, XNA has direct flights to New York, DC, San Francisco, and LAX. This unparalleled service is ideal for business travelers and those making connections to international flights. Most of the planes that fly out of XNA are regional jets (CRJ or Embraer), but they fly to most of the country's major hubs. The ground services are also above and beyond what is typical of an airport this size, with a large brewpub and high-quality furnishings. I am definitely impressed and would fly from XNA again.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
