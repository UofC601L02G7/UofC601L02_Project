2016-03-02,5,10,"""signs are hard to read""",B Mahoney,"Flown in and out of Harrisburg numerous times. A smaller airport with the gates being in a Y pattern so not a lot of walking. TSA is okay but did pre-check for last flight and still had to go through regular check. If you are scheduled for an early morning departure, forget any services being open - restaurants / car rental service counters and even the airline service counters. If your flight is at 6:45 and you arrive an hour before your flight, nothing is open.  For car rentals you have to walk quite a ways to / from the terminal through the parking garage to where your vehicle is located. I have been at other airports where your rental is brought curb side for you. Leaving the airport after dark is challenging if you are driving - signs are hard to read and not lit.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-10-20,10,10,"""small but connected""",Eric Rickenbach ,Harrisburg (MDT) is a great airport. Small but connected to many international gateways. Security lines are short. Food options are limited but good. I only wish they offered a NYC area connection. My airport of choice.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-06-26,10,10,Harrisburg Airport customer review,John Clifford,"There are many different airport choices for this area. Harrisburg (MDT) offers a good selection of carriers (United, Delta, US Air, Air Canada, Allegiant) which does wonders to keep the prices reasonable. Which makes it an appealing choice relative to Hagerstown, State College, Lancaster or Williamsport. There are also only 12 gates in the terminal. The daily parking garage is an easy walk (there's a shuttle to long-term parking), and a reasonable number of places to eat. The terminal is clean, reasonably quiet, and very easy to navigate and use. (Unlike Philly, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, or Reagan National).",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
