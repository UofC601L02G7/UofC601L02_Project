2024-08-31,10,10,"""handled the situation with excellence""",M Davis ,"Not Verified |  I believe myself to be semi-well traveled and have experienced many airport scenarios in my lifetime (middle aged) and will have to give kudos to Dallas Love Field TSA agents for their remarkable work getting me from the baggage claim area for general boarding all the way to my gate “with time to spare” in as little time as I can possibly fathom. I actually witnessed a family who did not make their flight (one prior to mine but same gate) and persisted by raising their voices that the gate agent should have known they were there but because TSA took so much time, they were late. The truth later came out that they were ONLY in line for one hour, on a holiday weekend. That is exceptional but poor timing on their part. Everyone in the aviation world knows that on a holiday weekend, there is a 2.5-3 hour minimum time preparation period to make your flight. So a free plug for DLF, consider this!! Saying all of this, not only was TSA awesome in their timeliness, but the gate agents kept their cool and handled the situation with excellence.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'August 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2024-07-20,2,10,"""This airport is horrible""",July Wellman,"Not Verified |   This airport is horrible. Upon checking in, the tsa people in the front were extremely rude and talked to me like I knew how their machines work because apparently I was standing in the wrong area. They told me to go to counter 5 and the lady at counter 3 yelled at me for not being in her line. They walked around yelling at people standing in line directing them elsewhere even though they told us to stand where we were. There were limited seating once you got in through the screening. The center of the airport was packed and there was no seating when i got lunch. Some of the outlets had no power so you could not charge devices. My flight was delayed due to the tech outage and the lady at the counter was extremely rude if you had asked her any questions. I understand that they can have a bad day but every employee I interacted with either seemed like they did not want to answer my question or just looked like they did not want to he here. I hooked another flight out of here again for my next trip, but I regret it.

The terminal is bright, spacious and with plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Going through security was a breeze with TSA-Pre. The Airport WIFI is easy to connect too and fast. The major drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. The bathrooms are small and there are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms.

Especially if you are a business woman wearing heals and toting luggage. What rocket scientist thought having the baggage claim so far away from taxi's etc,? It's the most ineffective, frustrating and idiotic change I have ever witnessed in any airport I've traveled through. Some genius needs to move the options back to the entrance of the baggage claim, duh. I really cannot believe they spent the dollars moving this so far away from the baggage pick up.

The airport was desolate and I discovered I could not be picked up at baggage claim, or even at the entrance where I was dropped off. No signage. My Uber driver told me. No signage or employee to alert passengers they had to go back into the airport, walk all the way back past check-in, up an unmarked escalator, then to the right and down an unmarked endless and not working sky walk to an unmarked elevator to a random spot in parking lot B. They say 10 minutes. MAYBE... if you're an athlete and know where you're going. I literally pushed a stranded and scared woman in a wheelchair.

The lines were slow as TSA repeatedly argued with airport employees trying to assist people in wheelchairs through the checkpoints. TSA were sarcastic responding to any questions. Supervisor refused to arrive for 45 minutes to assist me because I had my wallet stolen and needed to use alternate ID. A supervisor never came and i had to reactivate my Clear membership to get through. $189 because none of the herds of TSA employees standing around joking about passengers could do the ID confirmation process. As I result, I got to watch TSA ignore, belittle, and joke about harassing passengers. Absolute garbage, especially with disabled passengers and elderly passengers. I was shocked to watch them make clearly disabled passengers try to stand and walk. One lady, in particular, was confused and crying. Ruthless TSA.

That’s right, no one in the airport has it, all stores sold out. You would think proper planning would be a high priority for this outbreak but it’s not at Love Field. Also no staff has deemed it priority to give a tutorial of manners for coughing and sneezing. As I sit here this morning waiting to board my plane I can’t believe how many people are coughing without at minimum covering their mouth.

This airport is beyond crowded thanks to Southwest. I know it has been their home state airport since their beginning but good grief this was beyond anything I have seen in the past few years except for Seattle. Everyone I talked to going there said I would love the airport but that was not the case. 1) Too crowded 2) Too few restaurants 3) No lounges to escape to not even a USO.

It's above average for American airports, for sure, in terms of its accessibility, signage, speed of security (especially for TSA Pre-Check holders), cleanliness, modernity, and spaciousness considering the small size of the airport. The dining and shopping options are more than ample for a small airport, although nothing particularly, uniquely Dallas or Texas, in my opinion. Restrooms and seating are clean, USB chargers are ample.

Some negative points are not enough seating at gates, terrible congestion outside the baggage claim area and some general traffic woes that police are trying to improve. Nice now that Love Field has flights to all over the USA compared to the ""bad old days"" of the Wright Amendment (which would only allow flights to adjacent states).

2008-03-19,4,10,Dallas Love Field Airport customer review,M Smith,Living in Dallas there is no comparison between Love field and DFW. Love field is much quicker and efficient. It may not be as glossy but the chances of getting out on time are much much better. Also I have had flights cancelled at DFW that were never posted on the board. A couple times I waited a couple hours then was told at the gate when I went to check in that the flight was cancelled.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}

DFW has nice facilities which Dallas Love does not have but you won't be hanging out there long enough to need them chances are. They do have decent places to eat so you are covered there just don't expect to go on some shopping spree.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-09-19,3,10,Dallas Love Field Airport customer review,Mike Weber,This airport is great for a quick get in and get out as the gates are relatively close together on the Southwest side of the airport. Not much in the way of shops and restaurants but this airport isn't really designed for that kind of traffic. It's probably going to have to go through some changes and cleaning as they start adding more flights.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
