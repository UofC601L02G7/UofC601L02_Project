2015-04-22,9,10,Montgomery Regional Airport customer review,Don Orlando,Montgomery Regional Airport (Dannelly Field) has been completely modernized and is one of the most attractive small airports in the US. Check-in in close to the curb and security is efficient. Food and drink groundside and airside is basic. Deplaning is easy and baggage claim is close to the street. Parking is reasonably convenient unless you are travelling mid week. It can be a longish walk to the terminal.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
