2009-07-04,4,10,Fairbanks Airport customer review,S Koenig,Fairly small newish airport with a few international but primarily domestic flights. I saw no options for dining outside of security and inside saw just two (a bar and a small cafe). There appeared to be just two rest rooms and one was not usable since there was an international flight arriving (I did not understand the connection). Taxis in Fairbanks are pricey (and there is a $1 per person surcharge after the first passenger); fare from out hotel was over $25 for 4 people and Fairbanks is not a large city. If I were to return to Fairbanks I'd rent a car.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
