2024-04-25,6,10,"""I found the Airport was improving""",Ziauddin Ahmed,"✅ Trip Verified |  I used this airport several times past few years. This time I was traveling to Greenville, SC. I found the Airport was improving in terms of services and facilities. This airport is not too large one, but it has all basic facilities. Moreover, it is located in the central of Washington DC.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2023-12-02,8,10,"""barely a wait to go through security""",Mahmud Noormohamed,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review applies only to Terminal 1 (Arrival & Departure). For one of the busiest days of the travel season (Sunday after Thanksgiving), the terminal was busy but surprisingly uncrowded. From the boarding areas, there are views of the airfield and parking apron. Seating is plenty though at busier times there can be a dearth of seating. Food options are limited given the size of the terminal. To order food, the iPads which contained flight info, links to newspapers and magazines have been eliminated. U now have to us a QR code to scan the menu from your phone. WiFi service is excellent. Easy to connect and fast. There was barely a wait to go through security with TSA-Pre. The bathrooms on both arrival and departure were clean with an attendant cleaning the bathrooms frequently. Terminal 1 lacks a lounge, nonetheless its a good terminal.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2023-10-27,8,10,"""Overall, a good airport""",Mahmud Noormohamed,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review applies to Terminal 2 only (American Airlines). Transited through a rather busy Reagan National. There are great views for the airfield from the D concourse, terminal building and E concourse. The walk from the end of D concourse to the end of E concourse is rather long and with only a 40 minutes connection, I made it to the connecting gate in E concourse with 10 minutes to spare.

2022-09-24,5,10,"""purchase option was with a smart phone""",Barbara Rusher,Not Verified |  I was disappointed in the fact that I wished to purchase an alcoholic beverage during my layover with Southwest Airlines and found out that the only purchase option was with a smart phone. I don't have that type of phone and there wasn't an available restaurant that could accommodate me. I feel that was discrimination for the public that doesn't use that type of phone. What are you doing to accommodate that portion of the population? We're not all what you would like. if you want us you need to make it easier.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'September 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2022-05-31,3,10,"""Time to improve DCA authorities!""",Marisol Castro,"Not Verified |  I live in Alexandria, VA. I do not travel very often but I made a trip to Tampa, FL. this past Memorial weekend. My review or complaint is about the public restrooms service in DCA, small spaces, uncleaned, sinks clogged, broken faucets, no refilled soap dispensers, no coat/purse hooks, in resume a restroom service failure. DCA is the capital airport! What a shame! When I was in Tampa Airport waiting for my flight back to DC, I used the restroom, it was almost impeccable, also I saw an airport staff with a checking list. Time to improve DCA authorities!",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-08-27,1,10,"""worst run airport in the world""",Paul Cohen,Not Verified |  DCA is the worst run airport in the world. Nobody knows what is going on. The gate sign said closed at gate 47. After asking several airport workers the sign came on for gate 47. After 20 minutes the gate was changed to a different city. Do they told me gate 52. At gate 52 it said closed after the announcement on the public address said 52. They told me it is gate 48. At gate 52 they had no sign and told me they were going to another city. Later the sign changed to White Plains. The signed said boarding in 4 minutes. The only problem was the plane was not in. All I can say this is the worst run airport in the world.

2019-11-13,4,10,"""45 minutes for the bags to arrive""",D Wilson,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Quite a bad experience when arriving late. They could not get the jetway to work for perhaps 20 minutes. We just had to stay there in the plane. Then it took 45 minutes for the bags to arrive. It seemed that only one carousel was being used. We had to wait for another flight’s bags to be offloaded first.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-03-09,8,10,"""There is plenty of seating""",Mahmud Noormohamed,"✅ Trip Verified | This review applies to Terminal A. Transited through Reagan National. Its a very busy airport with Southwest, Frontier and Air Canada all operating from this terminal. There are great views of the airfield from the boarding area. There is plenty of seating however at peak times, there can be a dearth of seating. One of the new innovations is the dining area where orders are taken on iPads which have flight info and links to several newspapers and magazines as well as online games. WiFi service is very good and fast. Limited number of shops given size constraints of this terminal. The only thing I wish this terminal had is an airport lounge. However, given the space constraints in Terminal A, I do not see an airport lounger being built here. Overall, a good airport and terminal to transit through.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'February 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2018-12-01,9,10,"""left the terminal very fast""",Zoltan Szabo,✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived before some minutes 11 p.m. The aircraft stopped in the front terminal. I left the terminal very fast. My checked baggages waited for me. I caught the last Subway to city center.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2018-06-12,8,10,"""no lines at any airline desk""",M Howard,"Not Verified |  Terminal A at DCA was extremely pleasant to travel through. Since it is based on the oldest terminal of the airport, it has an intimate feel in the check-in areas. I traveled with Air Canada, and in the morning I traveled there were no lines at any airline desk. TSA was smooth, with barely any passengers passing through the checkpoint. The boarding area is nice with a good number of shops, and there are many iPads throughout the terminal, which shows the airport’s effort to keep up with airport across the country in modernizing. For Air Canada from the DC area to Toronto, I think that DCA is the best airport to go through out of the three airports in the area.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2018-01-24,7,10,"""there is no common use lounge""",R Thompson,"✅ Trip Verified | Nice Airport, especially the landside with a great view on the airside. Nice place to eat at the airside, however there is no common use lounge, what a pity when you are not flying in business class. Ready to pay 40-50 USD to get access to a common lounge and be in a quiet area. Hope the airport authority will be more modern in their decision making.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

I was flying Southwest, and it was a quick line for check-in. I will say there wasn't really much shopping choice where I was. The staff was very nice and caring unlike some airport employees. If you want to go to DC fly to this airport.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-06-25,6,10,"""location is a plus traveling into DC""",Chris Rhoden,"DCA is a good option if you only need a regional flight and can be a great option compared to Dulles. When the weather is poor, the central location of this airport on the seaboard is a drawback. Delays from weather quickly pile up here because they are limited by what airports are within range (a big storm can quickly knock several of the regional hubs like Atlanta out of service). You are better served using Dulles as an international or cross country traveller if only because you arent guaranteed to need a connection. As far as the airport goes, its clean and fairly modern. OK food, relatively comfortable for an older airport. Location is a plus if you are traveling into DC metro area.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-06-06,8,10,"""great asset is its location""",Bill Holmes,"This review is for Washington National Airport Terminal B-C; Terminal A is another matter. Washington Reagan's great asset is its location just 4 miles south of the city. Built in 1939, the airport has a small footprint and that makes things both very compact and somewhat limiting. Passenger drop-off and parking for Terminal B-C is very close and convenient. The terminal layout is highly logical and efficient, so check-in is easy and close to the gates. The airport is pre-9/11, so security sprawls out into the main concourse. Depending upon the time of day, there can be waits of more than 10 minutes, but since each pier has its own, the waits are seldom long. TSA Pre-Check is efficient and usually involves no wait or just a short term. Gates are very close by, hold areas can become congested. Ground operations can back up because the space is limited and most operations involve just one runway. Nevertheless, ground hold times are seldom very long. Arrival at Terminal B-C is a snap (at least until you get outside). Gates are a short walk from baggage claim. Bags are seldom delayed. Ground services are just outside. The small footprint of the airport means you've got a lot of pickups in a small area, so ground operations can get congested on the arrivals level. Washington's Metro is right at the airport and very tempting, but consider taxis or limos instead since Metro is undergoing a massive and highly disruptive construction project right now. Hint: If you're coming in during the evening and being met, arrange to meet on the departures level (two levels above arrivals), where there is no congestion. (Sorry, but this tactic doesn't work so well during the day.)",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-08-20,9,10,Washington National Airport customer review,Sam Comfort,Washington Reagan is the second-nicest airport in the USA. I only rate San Francisco's Terminal 2 (Virgin America hub) higher. Reagan is clean and modern. Despite being 15 years old or so it is kept immaculately clean. The architecture and layout are thoughtful. Well-designed for a pre-Sept 11th airport. The airport clubs are good but not great. The only real drawback are the TSA lines at peak times - Monday through Friday in the morning and in the evening (6am - 9am) (4.30pm to 7pm). I have probably flown out of this airport 400 times. One travelers' tip for departing travelers: Always check your airport. I recently had a mixed itinerary - out on IAD (Dulles) return to DCA. I showed up bleary eyed early at Reagan. I showed my itinerary to a United Airlines agent - she didn't catch my error either. Only when in the second line did I discover my mistake and hightail it to Dulles.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-05-11,5,10,Washington National Airport customer review,D Wong,Great location if you are trying fly out of Washington DC. Check-in at the counter was pretty quick but if you wanted to check-in a bag the agent will tag it for you but you will need wheel it off of the scale to the check- in bag area. Thank goodness I had the TSA pre-check. If not the queue was extremely long. My gate was 11 and I did not see any flight monitors in the surrounding area to check for flight updates. Luckily I had my phone which told me that my gate was moved to 10. This airport is definitely old and needs to be updated. Only the convenience factor is the only reason to use this airport out of the DC area.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-04-17,5,10,Washington National Airport customer review,Ken Gibson,I have used Regan many times and it is a fine airport but for one thing - the queues for security and the actually layout of the security areas. coupled with a number of staff who do not seem to know what work means. My most recent experience was last month when it took 40 minutes to get to departures amidst dozens of people becoming increasingly worried about missing their flight. Were it not for this my overall rating would be a lot higher and any recommendation I would make to other travellers would include being aware of these problems.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-11-27,8,10,Washington National Airport customer review,Paul Whiteley,Terminal C US Airways. Kerb-side bag drop was fine. TSA were incredibly friendly and then fast and efficient in processing a busy queue. Food/drink outlets land- and air-side were fine. Pleasant experience no complaints.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
