2017-02-02,1,10,"""airport is poorly managed and staffed and unacceptable""",Micah S Mabe,Flying with Delta Airlines last night and were cleared to land only to have us turn around back to Salt Lake City airport because the visibility was poor. When we got back to the gate we found out that there was not even any observers in the tower at Jackson Hole to guide our landing to the runway because apparently the airport closes at 11pm. What airport closes and more importantly does not have staffing to have an observer in the tower knowing a flight is coming? We flew out this morning only to have the same happen except this time it was them not preparing the runway. What airport does not accommodate for staff to prepare for a runway that has snow on it when the location has snow almost everyday around this time. This airport is poorly managed and staffed and unacceptable.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'February 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-04-19,9,10,Jackson Hole Airport customer review,W Burke,"This is a small airport. Check in and security are painless. Airside there are now 8 gates. There is floor to ceiling glass affording nice views of the Tetons. There is plenty of comfortable seating in the gate area that would get high marks from the people at ""Sleeping In Airports"". You still have to walk on the tarmac to board your plane. Sadly the food choices are unchanged from my last trip through. That is my only complaint. Still this is a very nice tertiary level airport. As always be sure to book an F side window seat for your daytime flight in.",yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2010-08-18,4,10,Jackson Hole Airport customer review,W Burke,This is a small airport to say the least. It only has 4 gates and this is after it is being modernized and expanded. Construction is still going on so it can be a bit noisy. Security is fairly painless. There is only one restaurant/lounge airside or curbside. Hopefully this will change when construction is complete. Airside has floor to ceiling windows affording views of the spectacular Tetons. Almost as impressive is the array of private jets lined up toward the south end of the airport. If you fly here be sure to take a daytime flight in and book an F side window seat for a jaw-dropping view of the Tetons on approach.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
