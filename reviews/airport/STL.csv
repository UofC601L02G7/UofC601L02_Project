It's not often that you encounter such exceptional customer service and genuine compassion in the service industry, but my encounter with two outstanding Huntleigh USA Corporation employees truly left me in awe. I found myself in a predicament when I was running late due to an unfortunate accident. Time was against me, and I was beginning to feel the stress and anxiety that comes with the fear of missing an important event. That's when Arlando Bolden and his colleague came to the rescue, turning my stressful situation into a heartwarming display of care and professionalism. Despite our best efforts, we arrived at our destination just a few minutes late. At this point, I had resigned myself to the possibility of missing my commitment, but Arlando and his coworker had other plans. They went above and beyond to ensure that I could still reach my destination. First and foremost, they helped me with the necessary arrangements, taking into consideration my convenience. This act of kindness was a relief in itself, but what truly touched me was their willingness to guide me personally. They recognized that my nerves were getting the better of me, and their calming presence made all the difference. Arlando Bolden deserves special recognition for his outstanding service and compassion. His dedication to his job and the well-being of customers is commendable. He was not just a helping hand but a beacon of support during a stressful moment. I am incredibly grateful to Arlando and his coworker for going the extra mile to ensure that I made it to my destination smoothly. Their actions exemplify the exceptional service that Huntleigh USA Corporation is known for, and I cannot thank them enough for their kindness. Huntleigh USA Corporation has earned my utmost respect and gratitude through this experience. They proved that they care deeply about their customers and are willing to do whatever it takes to make their journeys as pleasant as possible. I wholeheartedly recommend Huntleigh USA Corporation to anyone seeking reliable, compassionate, and customer-centric service. Thank you, Arlando Bolden, and your colleague, for restoring my faith in the kindness of strangers and for demonstrating the true spirit of customer service.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'September 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

",T Vincent,"Not Verified |  
I like this airport. It's very clean and has friendly people. But it's really dragged down by the lack of decent food options in concourse C. With flights not serving meals, a traveler can come into the airport famished, with a short layover, and there's nothing. The only place to get a decent comfortable table is Chili's and the food there is simply awful. Plus the staff seem to find the back row of tables by the work station a great place to hang out and share raucous jokes. With five or six of them going at it on my last trip, you could hear them all down the concourse. Trying to pass a quiet hour with my laptop was wrecked by the noise, like being next to a tailgate party. And here's some feedback for the Chili's people. When I was there none of the shouting parties were watching the tables while we customers were craning our necks trying to get menus or drinks or whatever. I couldn't figure out why there were so many employees doing nothing except having fun in mid afternoon when there were very few customers, the cooks were making the food and the bartender was handling the bar. Just one waiter finally started handling tables and while he was very nice he forgot my silverware and water - separate trips for both - and seemed shaky on the whole process. The manager, whom I met briefly, seemed to have no clue that a restaurant, even Chili's, is supposed to serve customers, not double as a social club for staff. As a former restaurant owner, I ranked him as worthless. Anyway, we desperately need a pleasant place to sit with at least decent food that's not just tasteless Chili's fare, liquids, bready pre-made sandwiches or sugary pastries.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2016-03-14,7,10,"""plenty of dining and shopping""",Chuck Griffin,"This review is for Terminal 2 at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. STL serves as a connecting center for Southwest Airlines, and serves a good number of local travelers as well. The security lines always seem long in the mornings but they do move fairly quickly, I was in line for about 15-20 minutes. No problems. The terminal post-security is decent sized although seating at some of the gates is on the light side so some people were standing. I managed to get a seat at one of the freestanding bar stool areas, but would have preferred a seat with a back. Plenty of dining and shopping options for those so inclined.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-02-16,5,10,"""personnel are friendly and helpful""",D Raben,"Overall I like the Lambert-St. Louis airport. Before I begin I should mention that I generally fly Southwest so this may be more directed towards that terminal. First, the positives. I've never had an unreasonable flight problem/delay during an arrival or departure from this airport. So the air traffic seems to be very efficient. The airport personnel are friendly and helpful. The layout is nice and it's easy to get to restaurants, coffee shops, and rest rooms. Security seems on par with most other airport security so while nothing special, I've not experienced an unusual problem. Second, the negatives. The only real serious negative I've found is their WiFi is simply horrible. To start, it's Boingo which I've found below par at most airports that use this provider. At Lambert, it's so weak and spotty it's essentially non-existent. Why is it serious? Because I'm usually flying on a work-related trip and not having good airport WiFi is a problem. Sure, I can use data from my Verizon account. But I can also try to fly through airports that don't have WiFi problem that this serious. The only other more moderate negative is the lack of electrical outlets at the gate seating areas. So overall, if you're traveling for pleasure, or don't rely on WiFi while in a airport, Lambert Field in St. Louis is a nice airport to fly through. On the other hand, if you count on airport WiFi, I'd avoid this one if possible.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-12-29,3,10,"""allow 3 hours+ to check a bag""",J Gilbert,Allow 3 hours+ to check a bag and get through security. Arrived at 3.30am for a 5.55 flight. TSA did not open security till 4.30am and then it was only one line. Already 200 people in line waiting when they opened. Did not open 2nd line until 5.30am.

2015-06-18,8,10,St Louis Airport customer review,P Cavins,"Of the Missouri airports, STL is superior to the rest! The airport has been recently renovated, and I think the improvements have definitely created an added value. Lots of good restaurants (both local places and national chains), and terminal has definitely benefited from the increased lighting. I think the airport still struggles with the American / TWA fiasco, but is working hard to be better.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-06-04,7,10,St Louis Airport customer review,M Weber,Had a 1 hour layover in Terminal 2 here. You can tell there's been a lot of upgrades as it's a lot brighter and cleaner than it used to be. Plenty of restaurants options but surprisingly no fast food options which I would have needed for a shorter layover. A number of gates are unused since American pulled back. One thing I really liked was the number of power outlets available at gates. Every 4 seats there was a power station with 3 regular outlets and 2 USB outlets to charge phones computers tablets etc.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 0, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-05-10,8,10,St Louis Airport customer review,P Jenkins,When held in its proper context of a medium-sized Midwestern city airport Lambert meets or exceeds expectations. An F4 tornado struck the main terminal (now known as Terminal 1) two years ago and it has taken a while for the terminal to get back on its feet. The proof of the rebuilding and improvement efforts can be seen in Concourses A and C with sleek modern facilities. The TSA line moved quickly and was managed professionally. The public transportation system known as Metrolink is clean and inexpensive to use. On the whole I used St. Louis Lambert Field three times last month and have nothing bad to say at all. I highly recommend using it.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-06-27,1,10,St Louis Airport customer review,David Manifold,"Lambert has seen better days. Since the ""tornado"" Concourse C is closed D is practically deserted with American flights. The airport is way out of date tired dirty crowded TSA is surly and ""full of themselves"" you can't imagine the arrogance. Prices are as high as LA but the restaurant service is a joke. I wish I could have seen Lambert back in the day now it is just dusty dirty and broken down. Very sad and frustrating place to visit.",,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2011-04-27,4,10,St Louis Airport customer review,M McManus,Used this airport during a day trip to St louis from Chicago. Flew in from O'Hare. Extremely good cheap and quick public transport to St Louis downtown via the Metrolink which has stations in both terminal 1 and 2. The airport has wi-fi but no computer stations so if you don't have a laptop you can't get on the internet. The telephones also seemed rather confusing for making international calls. The airport was undergoing considerable refurbishment and building work when I was there (March 2011) so there was lots of dust and scaffolding in the terminal. The terminal maps were slightly wrong which I assume was due to building work being in the middle of relocating the facilities they pointed to. Good bars and shops selling everything from coffee to TSA approved locks and hand baggage sized shampoos. Friendly staff.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-06-02,4,10,St Louis Airport customer review,A Boyd,The Saint Louis airport is in the process of being updated with a modern and attractive look. Terminal 1 is an architectually significant structure and it is already looking amazing now that the ceilings are cleaned up and the colorful LED lighting in the skylights adds a beautiful and energizing light show from both inside and outside the terminal. And with new flooring ticket counters new open views to outside and a new atrium opening up to the lower level the terminal will truly be a beautiful building. Add to this a raised brightened ceiling in the lower level new wall coverings colorful LED lighting on the structural columns along with new contemporary signs and a relocated security checkpoint it will be both efficient and appealing.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-08-08,4,10,St Louis Airport customer review,James Burke,Flew on Southwest so I was in the East terminal. The light rail system is convenient and inexpensive and right outside the terminal (there are 2 airport stops one for the East terminal and one for the main terminal). You do need cash for the train ticket and paying your fare with a $20 bill nets you a lot of $1 coins as change... Security is not bad but when flying WN one realizes that your fellow passengers are not the most experienced travellers and can make security a rather frustrating experience. The Chili's restaurant inside is not very good and line-ups are long at the fast food joints so I recommend arriving having eaten!,,{'Recommended': 'no'}

2009-01-25,3,10,St Louis Airport customer review,Matthew Ides,"As both a St. Louis resident and a former flight attendant I have a unique view of our aging airport. I've walked the entire length of the terminal to pass time on airport reserve. I've been on planes when I had to inform passengers ""sorry the jetbridge is broken today."" And I've also been a passenger myself standing in those long security lines. What St. Louis needs is a new series of gates - designed for the future - with an outlook of hope. St. Louis is not the worn out city depicted by our airport. We have one of the best environments to raise a family with inexpensive housing thriving second-city-suburbs and a revitalized downtown. Crime rates are falling and St. Louis is attracting high-tech business focused in the healthcare industry. No St. Louis doesn't need to be weighed down with an outdated airport. We need to move forward with new concourses built off the existing (and historical) domed entrance. The flaws in St. Louis' airport may appear daunting to passengers but I have seen airports around the world. St. Louis' general scheme is not poor - just the final execution. It's going to take a lot of work but with the right ideas - looking to build anew rather than simply modify - St. Louis can attract passenger and cargo carriers that other cities our size only dream about. Of course my interest in St. Louis is largely personal but I believe there is an opportunity to be made. The new terminal proposal would eliminate the one-side loading capability of the existing structure. In its place would stand three buildings stretched out in front of the ticketing hall. The center concourse will be connected to the ticketing hall by a gradual ramp that eases passengers through security and into the grand entrance to the new terminals - an open space that matches the size of other grand airports such as DTW. The other concourses will be connected by underground hallways and trams to the main concourse. One will serve primarily international flights. The other will allow Southwest to move into a new home. This leaves St. Louis with a separate East Terminal - room for those charter and private flights that are best kept separate from the rest of the traveling public. These improvements sound extreme but for a city that made an Arch for a city that still offers more free activities than anywhere but DC for a city that is our home - nothing is really impossible.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-09-04,3,10,St Louis Airport customer review,M Nixon,Flew into East Terminal (Southwest Airlines). Baggage arrived with in 20 minutes of landing. Took train to downtown St. Louis. Had to walk outside to get train which would have been a problem during the Winter. Train station will not let you purchase 1-way fare; must purchase 2-hour fare for $3.50. Beats paying 40.00 for taxi. No agents at airport train station and could not use credit card to pay for train. Return purchased 1-way fare for 2.00 to airport. Check-in very quick and efficient probably more to terminal being used completely for Southwest Airlines.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-06-29,3,10,St Louis Airport customer review,S Srinivasan,Not a bad airport though not great either. Security can be unpredictable; it only took about 2 minutes on my trip Wednesday but it took nearly 30 minutes on a previous visit - probably because they only have one checkpoint for each set of gates (A B C etc.). There's also a noticeable lack of food choices in the terminals and the terminals have a rather old depressing look to them. On the plus side taxi times to/from the runway and gates are short since the airport is relatively compact and the light rail (MetroLink) station next door to both the main and east terminals is nice.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-06-19,4,10,St Louis Airport customer review,R Pohle,Lambert International Airport compares favorably with many airports. The main building and concourses are pleasant and not as congested and hectic as many other airports. Public transportation excellent. There is a need for late night information and food services.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
