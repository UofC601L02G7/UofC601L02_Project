2008-07-05,3,10,Outagamie County Airport customer review,J Pavilack,The airport is very small. Only 4 airlines go there Northwest Airlink United Express Midwest Connect and Comair by Delta. There are only 9 gates at the airport. I flew there on Northwest Airlink and the guy that was at the check in desk also carried the luggage onto the plane. Only CRJs go there. There are very few shops so if you have a delay you dont have anything to do. The nice thing about it is since that it is small you get through security very quickly. Overall try to avoid it but if you have to then use it.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
