Our flight itinerary included a connection to final flight home (Orlando) through O'Hare. The entire experience was a complete cluster with no clear direction or informative staff. The process for visitors to exit the customs area from international arrivals was embarrassingly long and lacking in clear directions. I was chatting up a baggage handler to get some logistical direction for how to proceed from the customs verification area. The long, long line of people trying to get out of terminal 5 and make their way toward connecting flight terminals or even to exit airport was appalling. There should have been multilingual employees serving as ambassadors to assist passengers who did not speak English well or at all. We had to pick up our luggage and literally re-check it AND go through security protocol all over again as if we had just walked in off the street to begin our journey. We had to interrupt airport staff from personal conversations to ask for direction! We had to ask several times from more than one person who we assumed worked for the airport, which way to get to our terminal (had to move from terminal 5 to 1 to catch connecting flight), which way to TSA pre-check for security, and which line to get in when there appeared to be redundant, contradicting signs. There needs to be some intensive review of the entire customer experience for this airport. It was unfriendly, confusing, and left much to be desired for welcoming international guests.

When we arrived we were surprised that the queues weren’t as long as we had feared and the man who checked our passports were nice enough. Going through security a woman kept screaming “Step up! Step up!” so we avoided her at all costs. The personnel just kept sighing and seemed really annoyed to have to deal with passengers. On our return flight they were even worse. I wasn’t allowed to accompany my daughter as I had the previous time. She has social anxiety so that wasn’t very pleasant for her. The staff just kept screaming at people what to do and were super rude. I get that this is their job and they do this every day, but most people don’t fly every day and being nicer shouldn’t be that hard. When we had gone through security and arrived at the international terminal we went to buy some water and sandwiches at a self checkout and some guy asked us if we needed a bag. When I said no he said in a super angry tone that he still had to see that my payment went through. I guess we looked like criminals? I went to the bathroom and got looked in. Finally managed to get out. Same thing happened to my daughter later in the day. We had an 11 hour layover and all the seats were really uncomfortable. I hurt all over when we finally got in our plane. (That the guy in front of me had his seat fully reclined the whole 8+ hour flight is another story) We were in Arizona for 10 days and didn’t meet a single rude person in all that time and the personnel at Phoenix Harbor were very pleasant.

There are literally signs every 5 feet in the security line telling you that you have to remove anything larger than a cell phone from your bag. When I was attempting to remove my tablet, the TSA employee just kept saying over & over & over...(looking right at me) ""everything stays in your bag"". I politely asked why the sign indicated otherwise, and he just stared at me and said ""everything stays in your bag"". He wouldn't admit the sign states differently. After I finally passed through the metal detector, I got yelled at from another person, who takes her plastic badge very seriously, because I didn't put my bin away. TSA security was nothing but 20 minutes of being yelled at, being told we weren't making straight enough lines, moving too fast, moving too slow & getting ridiculed. They all roll their eyes & look at each other & snicker when someone doesn't do exactly what they think they should be doing. They really need to fix their system instead of getting mad when we can't understand why there are outdated signs. When we got to our gate, the woman working had zero patience for simple questions. We will use Milwaukee next time. Or any other airport not associated with Chicago where everyone hates their job! Just the worst airport. Perhaps they need to understand that a majority of the population doesn't fly on a regular basis. A little compassion & patience can go a long way. It must be exhausting being a TSA employee at O'Hare and being a miserable person every second of every day. I didn't want to give a 1 rating. I wanted to give a zero, but that wasn't an option.

The lines move slower than a snail and some of the staff are seriously rude and unprofessional. For an airport of this size, it is so poorly organized that newcomers will have to go on a scavenger hunt to find their gate, if it's not already very close by. If your gate is in a different terminal, good luck actually finding it without stopping to ask for directions. I had about twenty minutes to get to my gate before the doors would close, but my flight wasn't listed on any of the departure screens in Terminal 1, so I had to hear it from a staff member that my gate number would be on a departure screen in Terminal 3. Which meant ten minutes wasted traveling by train all the way to Terminal 3, only to find out that the gate itself is actually located in Terminal 2. The icing on the cake was that my gate was E5, but there were literally no signs at all in Terminal 3 that gave any sort of hint as to where the E gates were. Which makes absolutely no sense, since that was where they sent me to find my gate. I had to hear it from a staff member that I was in the wrong terminal, but not before asking at least four different people and getting no answer at all. The security lady decided to give me attitude when all I asked was how to find the E gates from Terminal 3. She told me that I needed to get through security first, which again, makes absolutely no sense at all and is basically no answer. So to sum it all up, this is one of the worst airports ever if you are in a hurry or you have a connecting flight.

My connecting flight wasn't until 9:10 PM. I designed this so that I would have plenty of time to go through customs, recheck my bag, and eat dinner before my next flight. That might be true at most airports but not at O'Hare! The customs line was inefficient and took way too long. I think O'Hare needs to look at how other airports (such as Atlanta) manage customs lines. They have a lot to learn. Once through the line, everyone was callous, rude, and unhelpful. I was moved back a significant number of spaces (Maybe 10?) in the baggage recheck line, simply because one of the workers changed the queue line while I was in it so that others could go ahead. Then I had to go back through airport security, which is apparently always a disaster in the evenings at O'Hare. Not a separate security line, but the same security line someone who has just checked into their flight for the first time has to go through. The line wasn't moving, the workers were extremely rude, and I had olive oil I purchased in Croatia confiscated because it was ""suspicious"" even though it was in the proper marked bag for customs. Not to mention, the worker took an extraordinarily long time to check the marked bags, and cut them open. I missed my flight (even though I had a 3 hour cushion), never got dinner because all restaurants closed, and had to sleep in the airport overnight or risk having the rest of my items confiscated since she cut the customs bag open.

My flight boarded late apparently due to airport congestion preventing the plane from approaching the gate. Repeatedly having the boarding/departure times changed resulted in virtually all passengers standing for more than 45 minutes. There are no ""queue"" lines and passengers just grouped - congesting the walk ways.

Next - loud announcements ordering us to get our checked luggage (which had been checked through to our final destination) before going through customs. We found the baggage carousel with people packed around - and had an anxious two hour wait for our bags to arrive.

During that two hour wait - many of our fellow passengers were in despair that they had missed their flights. Once we got our bags - we went through another line with our bags past a single agent who took our stamped customs card. That was the customs check.

People were packed into the large room waiting for others to wander around looking for an available kiosk to scan their passport. So unorganized. How about putting the kiosks in a row for people to use while in line? Once finished, we had to stand in long lines again waiting to get checked through. There were only 7 windows open for hundreds of people to funnel through. And, not to sound like ""that guy"", but they were speeding the non-citizens through a lot faster. 2 were for working visas and students, 5 for citizens and tourists. They should be putting the tourists with the non-citizens. They should also have a line for connecting flights because this is the second time we almost missed our flight due to this mess and we weren't the only ones stressing over a connecting flight. Once we eventually got through, getting our bags was pretty quick and easy, but after that, there were no signs saying where to go next. We just got in the super long line with everyone else. My wife went ahead to talk to someone to make sure we were in the correct place. That person told her that we needed to go outside the huge room to a different place so she ran back and got my son and I and we did as he said. Once we got out and the doors closed behind us, we found out that we were in the right place before and now we had to wait for someone else to come out so we could go back in. We went to to counter to talk to them again and they said to just leave our bags there and go to our flight and they would scan them in for us. I didn't feel comfortable about just leaving our bags next to the counter while they were checking in other people who were waiting in line, but we had no choice. Our flight had started boarding and we were nowhere near the terminal. We missed using the family lane for going through security twice because the lane was roped off. Someone who works there saw us and opened it and they were genuinely surprised that he had to tell us to use it. In all the chaos, we lost one of our boarding passes, so we had to rush to the ticket counter to get a new one printed. She insisted on reprinting all 3 passes even though we only needed 1. After that was done, we started to run to the next step when my wife checked and saw they printed the wrong name on my boarding pass. We decided to just use the old one since it didn't need to be reprinted anyway. It was like she was deliberately wasting our time when we had none to waste. We ran to the tent outside (by the way, we weren't dressed for cold weather because we had no plans to leave the airport so my 7-year-old was freezing right along with us) where we were told to wait for the bus. There were so many people that we had to wait for the next one. We knew we had to go to terminal 1, but when the driver stopped, he never said anything. He just opened the door. Now, I could assume that the first stop is terminal 1, but I hate to make assumptions and get off the bus at the wrong terminal when we're already pressed for time.Luckily, someone else said they could see a ""1"" outside, so we got off and ran. We made it to our flight while they were almost finished boarding. 2 hours should have been enough time to get through, but it almost wasn't.

In 2019, the experience was a real mixed bag, first things first, most people I met working at the airport could not have been friendlier or more helpful. A true positive. Even the TSA personnel and incredibly overworked gate agents were patient yet efficient, though, I know this isn't always the case, as with the overworked yet strangely entitled and lackadaisical barista at Starbucks. Oh well, there always seems to have be at least ""that one"" in airports. However, while I've never had particularly negative experiences, this airport is still not easy to like or embrace. It's clearly outdated, outmoded, and overused, if you've ever watched ""Home Alone,"" which came out in 1990, I'm pretty sure the airport looks today just as it did in 1990 (and even earlier). The airport is dirty all the way around and not well taken care of, even smelling what I can describe as dank and damp in certain areas. Gate seating is not ample. While there are plenty of dining and shopping options both pre- and post-security, many of those options have a sort of dingy feel, no matter how well run they are and how friendly the staff are. The lighting and flooring suck, and even the sporadic display of attractive, futuristic-by-1980s-standards artwork doesn't change that fact. Even though the area of Chicago in which O'Hare is located is generally nice and middle-class, the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) train station below the terminal has a strangely uncomfortable feeling - and the station and CTA trains are just filthy, even though the station is less than 30 years old (that's CTA's fault, though). Back upstairs, ride shares take longer to arrive and drop off than at many other large airports, even when things aren't particularly crowded. In all, O'Hare provides a poor introduction to, and representation of, an otherwise friendly, vibrant and unique city called Chicago.

Between the bare-bones number of TSA screeners on shift and being selected for additional screening/pat down, I missed my connecting flight by two minutes.

Despite most people I know telling me that O’Hare is awful, I thought it was okay overall - in fact, I found them quite efficient. I arrived in a Chicago on a Thursday. Being Canadian, I was able to breeze past immigration through their automated clearance system, and got through in 10 minutes. The immigration officer had a serious expression, and waved me through really quickly. My bags arrived shortly after I reached he reclaim area. Seeing as my flight arrived 2 hours early, I tried to get switched to the earlier flight, and after the United ground staff dealt dealt with the frustratingly lengthy process of rebooking my flight, she was able to land me a seat on the flight and helped me ensure that my bag would be checked in to that flight despite there only being a one hour window to departure. This also meant that I needed to rush to Terminal 1 from the international terminal. Rushing to Terminal 1 is normally easy, seeing as they have that automated people mover, but it’s undergoing long-term maintenance/being rebuilt in sections, so it’s closed on weekdays. This meant that I was at the mercy of the shuttle bus, which was obviously slower to board and arrive, due to the very peculiar traffic design between terminals. There was this one intersection that allowed one bus through at a time and took close to 10 minutes to clear. Despite all that rushing, I was still able to get to my flight in time, partly due to their speedy TSA crew that in dealing with the backlog decided that’s passengers could go through with their shoes on. My flight back from Minneapolis occurred without a hitch, though arriving with a 3 hour layover gave me a chance to really soak up the architecture and movie filming locations in the 3 main terminals. I probably could’ve also tried their dining, but alas, I have not. When it comes to waiting for flights, the seats at Terminal 1 are old, but adequate. I appreciate their provision of outlets near seating for device charging, but it would probably be even better if they also provided USB ports on the outlets, and fitted universal outlets seeing as travellers may not have the correct adaptors.

Once we were able to deboard the plane, we had to find the international terminal. The airport had very poor signage for this, so we stopped to ask a staff. He told us the quickest way would be to go to the end of the G gates and take a shuttle to the M International terminal to avoid having to exit the airport and go through security again. Once we got to G17 where the shuttle was, a female airport worker told us she needed to see our boarding passes and passports. We handed them over and she said she couldn't allow us to be shuttled until she confirmed our flight was still there. I told her that my Delta app confirmed that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes. I had also heard an announcement that all flights were delayed from the weather since no planes were able to take off or land. She insisted on checking Google Flights for her update as well as got on her walkie-talkie to ask someone who was in the international wing if our flight was still there. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking and we need to board our plane. This person who works at the damn airport would not use the airport computer to check our flight status and continued to rely on Google Flights.

2018-09-06,1,10,"""Avoid this airport""",Chris Ardy,"✅ Trip Verified | Avoid this airport if at all possible. Horrendous experience both arriving and departing. When we arrived it took over half an hour to get off the plane because information on connecting flights had be posted just outside the exit and caused congestion. We then made our way down to immigration control which was in chaos. There were no proper signs just some people shouting instructions which nobody could understand. We followed people and ended up in the wrong place. After 10 minutes we were then told where we needed to go by somebody we could understand. This was the longest queue I have ever seen, It took us 15 minutes to get to the back of it. When we got near the automatic machines we were stopped for about 15 minutes because the queue after the machines was too long and was clogging up the machine area. When we used the machines our documents were rejected. We later found out that the machines were rejecting 95% of people. This was the basis of the queue. Because of this we had to go in the next queue to be dealt with manually. Altogether it took nearly 3 hours to get through the immigration. Departing was not much better. After checking in, which took about 40 minutes because BA do not have a bag drop option and only 2 desks open for Economy and Premium Economy passengers we were then faced with another huge queue for immigration. It was so long it spilled out onto the check in area. Once through immigration the security check was relatively quick although I had to be body searched because I left a plastic comb in my pocket! It took over 2 hours to get through. One of our worst experiences at a USA airport, although departing from here was also bad a couple of years ago, so a place to avoid.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Lines can crisscross and you really need to be patient as you go through the process. I had a red eye flight and I wanted to get a meal before boarding. Unfortunately most restaurants were closed by 9pm. As expected the one open restaurant was swamped with customers. The restaurant staff could hardly cope with orders taking a long time coming.

2018-08-25,7,10,"""an abundance of restaurant choices""
",A Pearson,"✅ Trip Verified | I feel like O'Hare gets a bad wrap overall for a few reasons, but some issues are legitimate, and the experience will vary greatly depending on which terminal you go through. For starters I usually fly United, and usually go through Terminal 1 or 2. I don't fly through Terminal 3, and my experience in the International Terminal has only been for one arrival recently. That said, I can break down Terminal's 1 and 2 which are good overall in my view. For starters the main issue with United is connecting flights can take a little while to get around. Terminal 1 is separated into two concourses connected by an underground walkway. In theory you could have a connecting flight on United Express which are mostly located in Terminal 2 despite your regular United flight may land at the C-Gates in Terminal 1. Therefore, you may have to walk from the end of the C-gate to the central area to reach the underground tunnel, go underground the tarmac, pop up at Terminal 1, then go to the end to reach the walkway to Terminal 2, then you'll cross into Terminal 2, and finally you are at your gate. It sounds like a long walk because it is. I recommend at least have 30 minutes to transfer flights. Then the other issues at O'Hare can be queue times for TSA, or some restaurants. I can say from personal experience the TSA at O'Hare have been relatively quick, as in no more than 20 minutes to get through during most times, however, during some peak times such as 4-6 pm, then lines can get long and take over 30 minutes. It has been random since sometimes during ""peak times"" things have been quick. I finally got TSA pre-check, so I'll see how that goes when I fly out tomorrow. Finally the last big issue is the poor wifi. It's Boingo which is too expensive, and at times it doesn't process your purchase correctly. Try to get into a United Club for wifi. I have gone through some personal negatives, and likely negatives for flyers in Terminals 1 and 2. The good news there are pluses. For one, the food choices are good. There are some local chains including Rick Bayless own chain which has solid Tex-Mex sandwiches, and amazing Guacamole. I believe Wow Bao is located in O'Hare, and there is a local tea chain as well. Meanwhile there is an abundance of restaurant choices such as steak, Italian, seafood, cafe food, etc. From my experience I haven't had a bad meal. Keep in mind, don't expect Michelin star restaurants, but if you have a good layover, then you can get a good meal. Finally the bar scene isn't bad, but prices are airport prices. At least Goose island has bars with local tapped beer. Finally the last positive is the location. The blue line connects to O'Hare, 24/7, to the Loop. It's near I-90 and I-294 which help drivers get around anywhere in the Chicagoland area. That said, if you are going to Northwest Indiana, or Joilet, then it'll take a good hour to get there from O'hare. That said, the taxi stand is outdated and slow. Expect to spend a good 30 minutes to get a taxi. Overall it is a good big airport. It's not perfect, nor the best in the world since I've been to LHR to Narita, however, as a large US airport it's one of the better ones in my view.

I had the misfortune of transiting through O,Hare on my way back from LAX, which isnt much better.

I walked for what seemed miles, looking for some sort of information or advice on how to proceed. The flight information board didn't show my connecting flight either so I had no way of knowing where to go or which terminal I should be looking for. The information desk was unmanned. Eventually I found a young lady who was on a security checkpoint. She advised me that I should make my way via shuttle bus to Terminal 5. Having done so, I then stood for 11/2 hours at security before I reached the gates only to find that there were no flights form my carrier (United). Again, I spent ages trying to find someone to speak to for information. Eventually I found a woman pushing a trolly. She advised me that I should be at T1 as that's where United fly from. By now my 3hr transit window had all but gone. I returned to the shuttle bus and the Queue was over 200 people deep. I approached an official with a yellow jacket on who was supposedly in charge of the queue and explained I have an extrememly short connection, he refused to allow me on the bus and told me to join the end of the queue. I had no option but to barge through or I woould miss my flight. Eventually I made it back to T1 and through security AGAIN and eventually to my gate with 5 minutes to spare.

",G Anderson,"❎ Not Verified |  I am a born and raised Chicagoan that is extremely embarrassed at the poor operation for international arrivals at O'Hare. The airport staff are completely clueless and have no issue yelling at each other and at passengers (employees at passport control). They go out of their way to make the process more chaotic and difficult (customs). As an example, the line at customs to leave the baggage claim area was extremely long. Personnel waited until passengers went almost completely through the line before telling a few people ""there is no line at carousel 3"". If they had directed passengers to other available counters, the whole process would have been easier. The tram to other terminals and to access CTA was not available, but they had shuttle buses. Instead of having signage posted, they simply put ""Closed"" signs on the escalators heading up and had rude and unprofessional staff standing there. When asked how we were supposed to access the CTA, I was told ""it's not running."" What she really meant was that the tram was not running. At that point, I had already spent over 2 hours in the airport and was so tired of dealing with incompetence that I took a cab rather than deal with any other employees. Seriously, O'Hare. You need to get it together. So many people experience Chicago only through your airport, and you make us look hood.

American is all in Terminal 3, concourses G, H, K and L. It can be a hefty hike from a commuter flight at the end of G to a flight at the end of L, as it's pretty spread out. In general, I find O'Hare to be busy and crowded. The concourses are too narrow for the number of travelers, and the usual boarding-time gate-cluster can choke off the entire concourse. The restrooms are generally abysmal - tiny, crowded, questionably sanitary. It's not through any fault of the staff, I regularly see staff cleaning them but O'Hare's restrooms are generally 2 or 3 stall wonders, sprinkled here and there for millions of travelers. O'Hare's dining options, on the other hand, are great. My personal favorite is the Cubana Torta from Frontera Torta in Terminal 3 - it's life-altering. There is an ample selection of dining choices whether you want fast food, upscale dining, healthy salads or a Chicago pizza. Shopping is also similarly good - I generally only need drinks and snacks, but O'Hare has the largest Hudson News I've ever seen, in the common area between Terminals 1 and 2. There are a fair number of upscale stores throughout, though. Connecting through O'Hare, I always make sure I have more than an hour between flights. Two hours is better. I have been delayed many times, to some extent or another, on my arrivals into ORD. Sometimes it's a broken regional jet. Sometimes it's a weather delay. MANY times, though, it's a delay from ground operations, after we land - my personal record is spending 45 minutes taxiing and parking out on the tarmac due to ground traffic. I would count on spending an average of 20 minutes between landing and actually reaching your gate. I still use O'Hare. It's the only airport American serves from one of my local airports, and one of only a few from my other home base. Flight selection through O'Hare is generally good.

No other flights to any nearby cities were leaving that evening. We thought about renting a car and driving (4-5 hrs) home, but the costs were over $250 for those agencies willing to even let us take a vehicle one way. United rebooked us on a 7 am flight the next day, but would not offer hotel vouchers. By this time it was almost midnight. The service agent mentioned that ""somewhere"" in Terminal 2 cots might be available for the evening. We wandered around until we discovered probably 100 people already resting in cots in Terminal 2. Kudos to O'Hare for making these available, however, never throughout the night were the lights dimmed in the corridor, nor were the TVs turned down or the overhead announcements stopped. Additionally, the airport employees continued to walk by talking loudly, or driving various vehicles as if it were 11 am, not 3 am. It was like trying to sleep at a racetrack. And then they woke us all up at 4.30 so they could put away the cots! I am sure the city of Chicago would prefer that we all go get a hotel room, but an additional expense of $100 and up is often not in the family budget - not to mention the time involved to travel in and out of the airport.

Most airports have this part down, but queries resulted in mocking statements like ""It's obvious, just follow the people over there."" The people ""over there"" were not going to American Airlines to get their already-checked-through baggage onto the next plane, or to hand over their customs declaration form (by the way, nobody took my form and I never found any customs officials). Every query I made of some official-looking person resulted in more ridicule and less information, as the hour of my departing flight grew nearer.

I must say that this was my worst airport experience in 38 years of travel all over the world-mainly because of the rudeness and angry, scowling personalities of airport staff. They did not want to be bothered with helping or giving information.

After exitting the customs, the arrivals terminal is nothing special, with plenty of connections to downtown and a coach bus terminal to take you elsewhere.

With mountains of luggage being taken off early from the conveyor belt just to make room for more flights. The entire terminal unnavigable with the amount of craziness that was going on. There was a line that stretched through the baggage hall and all around it just to get land side. The line took an hour an if someone had any connections they wouldn't be able to catch them. If Chicago O'hare wants to be able to handle A380s and more planes they are going to need lots of renovations.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-07-18,1,10,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,William Gustin,"I understand O'Hare is remarkably busy and has the weather to contend with so I do extend some grace for the reality induced by the moderately rainy day of my travel. However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare. Does it need to be this way? O'Hare - it's time for a big disruptive change in flexible workflow and smart throughput, a desperate need for profound innovation.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-07-16,9,10,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,Bob Motto,"I recently had to transit through Chicago O'Hare from American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight to London. Passengers who transit from AA to BA Transatlantic can now transfer Air Side between Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 International Departures, this means that there is no additional security to go through once you have cleared security at your original US departure airport for the domestic segment. Transer from the domestic to the international terminal took a matter of minutes & was so easy to do which meant no more rushing to get to the transit system and then go through security again. Anyone can now transfer now with ease and no stress, we just need to have the same for inbound and that will make the whole experience much more enjoyable.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-07-16,9,10,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,Bob Motto,"Flew from London to Chicago with BA upon arrival in Chicago I was dreading the lines for immigration and customs, however to my surprise no lines at all! I was through immigration, customs and re-checked my luggage all within 25 minutes which is amazing. It is still a shame that there is no airside transfer between terminals but I am sure that will come as passengers who are travelling with BA to London & who transfer from a AA or American Eagle flight can now use the shuttle to transfer between terminal 3 to terminal 5 international departures. Otherwise a great experience with good facilities for passengers.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-06-24,9,10,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,Scott Bloom,Easy signage. Food and quality moving to higher level. Charging stations improving. More will have to be added quickly. New airport map is available and excellent. Luggage moves quickly to luggage belts. Concourses clean. Maybe brighten or modernize to freshen up.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-05-20,2,10,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,D Nachiket,The Airport terminal looks decent. But sadly it lacks facilities that even Mumbai has. Fewer charging points no free wifi.

2015-02-18,1,10,Chicago O'Hare Airport customer review,Fred Meyer,"Terrible airport many flight delays because of ""weather"". De-icing policy is ridiculous. Avoid this airport unless final destination is Chicago. Try MSP as far more reliable alternative.",,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
