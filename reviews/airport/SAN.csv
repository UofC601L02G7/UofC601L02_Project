2024-09-10,3,10,"""always disappointing""",Mike Roberts,"Not Verified | I've traveled extensively in my lifetime, to Airports all over the world. SD Lindberg Field is always disappointing. I flew out mid-morning on a Wednesday to Atlanta (ATL). Seating at our assigned gate was full / not adequate, so we sat at an empty gate nearby. ATL, I feel, is what every big city wishes there airport to be. Large, clean and efficient for people, planes and cars. ATL has a great ground transportation system in place and a Rental Car center, which is next level, with easy freeway access. My flight back to SD arrived early, but we spent the time gained sitting on the tarmac waiting for a gate. Once off the plane, I visited a small, crowded restroom across from my arrival gate, which obviously hadn't been cleaned for a while. It smelled like an outhouse. Baggage claim took longer as they had two flights using on one baggage carousel. The ride back to our car at an area parking business was problematic (another issue) due to short staffing. Also of note, riding in the overcrowded van, was how poorly maintained the roads, into and out of the airport, are. I know airport construction has been going on forever, but the roads around the airport need to be repaved. Good first impressions are important. If SD truly wants to be a world-class destination, it has to quit trying to make a small, single runway airport do the job and build a new, modern air (and ground) transportation center. You cannot shoe horn a large, efficient airport into the space Lindberg Field occupies. Sadly, in today's dollars, I don't see that happening. I'll look to use John Wayne Orange County or Ontario next time.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We arrived from a 5 hour flight from Hawaii with TSA precheck, already gone through the checks in Hawaii, so we had snacks and waters, not knowing we would have to exit the terminal and go back through TSA. As we approach, we are told we do have to go back through, so we queue up, and realize these people are literally stopping every single person: families with kids and tubs of vasoline, families with candles and things they purchased, myself with an unopened bottle of water I purchased in the airport after going through TSA. We all just had them throw our stuff out. The hubs are set up so that it's just a big circle with gates and one bathroom for men and one for women, so once again we queue up to go into another filthy area that clearly had not time available to clean because it was so busy. Then we couldn't find seats to wait for our flight out because there was already so little space, until the last flight left.

Interested in a drink at the bar - good luck finding a wedge in the crowd to order something. And then enjoy your beverage leaned up against a wall since there is significant lack of seating. If you are Southwest passenger making a connection, be prepared to enjoy TSA security twice. The airport does not have a way for passengers who have already passed through security to get to another terminal. Passengers making a connecting flight in another terminal are forced to exit the secure area, requiring them to go back through security. This is frustrating and a waste of time. Several other passengers and I were forced to throw things away that could not go through security that we had purchased at our previous airport, on the secure side. And, as a frequent traveler, with TSA pre-check, I have never been asked to take my laptop out of my bag when going through security.

There were only two lines open, priority and the rest of us. The line was moving extremely slow and then to top that off a leak of sewer water from the ladies restroom to the right started moving toward the line. There were a couple of contract employees just standing there for about 20 minutes as the sewer water moving into the non-moving line. Finally some TSA guy comes out and moves some of barriers around to avoid having people stand and lug their bags through the sewer water. He calls on the radio on how many lanes are open (one) and asks to open another one. I suggest to him that someone shut the WATER off in the bathroom. He says that's maintenance's responsibility. 25 minutes later we get to the lane and there is another barking TSA employee (only thing they do) who yells at me for putting my glasses back in my pocket after the X-ray before he tells me to. He also barks at people for not taking their shoes off, and I mention that we've been standing in sewer water for the last 45 minutes, so maybe that's why people are hesitant to take their shoes off when now the floor leading up to the X-ray has water tracked from people standing in that water.

The terminals are far too small for the volume of flyers passing through it, and it’s setup is a logistical nightmare. I arrived at Terminal 1 this afternoon and flew out of Gate 2. First problem I noticed was that one can only access certain gates through certain security checkpoints. Gates 1, 2, and 2A are located behind their own security checkpoint which doesn’t have TSA Pre-Check. I am a business flyer and carry an extensive amount of electronics in my baggage, all of which had to come out (in their own, separate bins) to go through the X-Ray. Also had to remove my liquids which took forever. The security line moved extremely slow due to the lack of separated TSA Pre-Check, so arrive early. Once through security, you are guided into an extremely overcrowded waiting area with very limited vendors (similar to MCI, you have to go outside of security to get something to eat). Seating is very limited and the room itself is very dirty, and the boarding posts have zero room to move around.

2018-09-25,1,10,"""act more like intimidating prison guards""",W Andrews,"✅ Trip Verified | San Diego “International” Airport’s Immigration Officers and Customs practices are, with very few exceptions, the worst, small-minded, parochial group of bullies I have ever experienced in all my years of international traveling. They have no idea (and they obviously don’t care) that passengers who enter using “Global Entry” have already gone through extensive background checks, finger-printing and biometric security clearances. The whole point of using Global Entry is to already answer such questions as “do you have anything to declare” via the automated kiosks and to confirm one is a trusted traveler. Yet without exception, San Diego Immigration Officers demand one hand over one’s passport and Global Entry receipt, they take an interrogative attitude, study the passport at their leisure and demand to know if one “bought anything or has anything to declare”! The whole point of answering the questions at the kiosk is so there is no need to be interviewed by an Immigration Officer! Every airport in America has fast track lanes where Global Entry passengers automatically walk right through, immigration and customs officials simply take the Global Entry receipt, no stopping, no demanding one hand over one’s passport, no questions asked. Clearly, San Diego immigration Officers do not want to accept the “fast track” part of Global Entry as a way to justify their existence to heavy-handedly screen passengers arriving on what is a minute number of daily international arrivals. Almost without exception, they act more like intimidating prison guards and management obviously allows them to act like this with impunity. This practice is unwarranted, unacceptable and completely defeats the entire purpose of the Global Entry vetting process. Another completely overreaching, baseless practice San Diego “International” Arrivals “Customs” requires is for passengers to queue up after they have passed through immigration and collected their luggage and have all their luggage x-rayed again before they can exit the airport! No other airport x-rays luggage after one arrives at ones destination! This is such typical San Diego small-minded, provincial mentality. As if pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage from international flights is less rigorous than pre-flight x-ray screening of luggage on domestic flights? How arrogant and uninformed. San Diego wants so badly to grow its international flight business, but it will never be an international airport with the immigration and customs practices they are using. With the above practices, it will remain a back-water, regional little airport staffed by amateurs who relish the idea that they are in positions of power and want to bully people.

2017-02-13,7,10,"""a more pleasant airport than many""",R Matthews,"✅ Verified Review | San Diego airport is a nice size but a short on restaurants and other amenities and can be become congested at peak times. At Terminal 1 there are two isolated gate concourses and each only has one real restaurant. You can't get from one concourse to the other without going back through TSA. It's a poor design and gives the vendors in each concourse a monopoly. Getting to the airport can get very congested at busy times as there are some severe bottlenecks for cars, taxis, shuttles, Uber, etc. But at non-peak hours and times of year it's generally pretty good. It's not the airport's fault directly, but the surface streets around the airport are crumbling, sometimes too narrow, have pot holes that could swallow a german shepard, and make getting too and from the airport unpleasant at best. Also look for the nearby Mobile station to refuel your rental car. The closer Shell is nearly a $1/gallon more (at least in Feb 2017). It's annoying all the shuttles, taxis, rental car bus, etc pick you up and drop you off on the other side of an impenetrable fence. So you're forced to go up a long slow escalator to take a sky bridge. Many airports, even much larger ones, have crosswalks across the surface traffic to get to those areas but SAN forces you to use the awkward sky bridge. On the plus side the WiFi is free, fast, and easy to access. What few food options there are tend to be fairly decent (if typically airport expensive). They also have some decent options before passing through TSA (unlike many airports) including the Breeze and Jack In The Box at Terminal 1. And the restaurants that I've been to (including Breeze) clearly display the prices for everything including adult beverages (unlike many airports). TSA lines are generally reasonable and, even at peak times, I think I've waited at most around 15 minutes. But each TSA station serves relatively few gates which helps a lot. It's nothing like the TSA nightmare in Seattle. There's also the relatively new centralized rental car center which is a big improvement over a bunch of little off-site rental locations. The shuttle service is faster and, if for some reason, something goes wrong picking up your rental you have a dozen or so other choices in the same building.
