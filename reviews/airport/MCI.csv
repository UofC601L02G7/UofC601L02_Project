With enough space to accommodate surges. I'll take this airport any day over an Atlanta Delta layover. Clearly a new addition to the Kansas field (did not experience old terminal). Customs/bag claim, re-check, and re-screen for TSA for the domestic leg was super quick. Really like the glass jetways. Friendly TSA and gate agents. Bag claim and TSA were all quite clean. Gate areas were dirty - and not in the post-rush kind of way. Heavy duty cleaning seemed neglected/deferred. One example that stuck out: Dusty and fingerprints on window area/sills, etc. Bathroom sink areas could have received more attention. Some soap dispensers not functioning. A small gripe: Impossible to get a bottled unsweet tea anywhere in the facility. Every retail business had the exact same drinks in their grab and go coolers. My guess is it is contracted out to Pepsico or something. What's the point of having multiple retail businesses if they all serve the same stuff? Overall, I really like the size and style of the facility.

They must have forgotten about signs for baggage claim because they only have sandwich boards in the main terminal area directing you to the baggage claim. We found NO SIGNS for rental car area. Finally got a broadcast on the PA regarding car rental location and shuttle. The TSA lines were very long even though not many people are here. They had the area roped of as if they were expecting a large crowd and didn't bother to shorten the lanes when not needed causing people to walk more than necessary. The new seats are uncomfortable. Our TSA person at the baggage check area was rude and didn't seem to know the rules for people over 75.

2023-07-06,7,10,"""modern necessities one would expect""",James Metz,"Not Verified |  Feedback on my initial visit to MCI (new terminal). I am a Kansas City native --- this review is critical, as it should be. Overall impression is outstanding compared to the 1970s era terminals. It addresses the needs of a 21st century Midwest airport with all the modern necessities one would expect as a flying customer. First impression walking in, it's big. It spans wide and the design incorporating natural lighting with an abundance of windows is refreshing. The evening sunlight streaming in through different angles really provides a ""non-restricted"" feel as you walk about the terminal. The respective airline check-in counter/placements are easy to identify and span the width of the front end of the terminal for easy access. Security access is fairly streamlined and the entire process is able to accommodate large volumes of travelers (non-TSA airport - VMD corp) more natural light as you progress through each arm of the terminal (A/B/C) with interior lighting not overbearing. The walkways are wide and allow for excellent views of the tarmac, exterior gates, and various angles of the entirety of the taxiways and runways. Additionally, the escalators and walking escalators are positioned nicely and push you through terminal in a speedy manner. More shops, etc. at each terminal branch, providing basically anything the traveler would need. The vibe and local venues are all a welcome addition and definitely fulfill the needs of the traveler. Individual gates and structured well and offer comfortable seating and ample wireless device charging. The one thing that seems odd is the placement of the gate flight monitor(s). It is essentially in the seating area of the individual gates. Why not place it directly behind/above the agent booth/desk for easy and quick access and explanation (poor design decision). Boarding the plane, the traveler is treated to long glass jet bridges that allow for excellent views of adjacent aircraft and outside weather conditions. This is a well thought out design that many major airports do not offer. Overall, the new MCI/KCI terminal is a massive upgrade to the Kansas City area. It has the opportunity for expansion and I would expect future modifications to address design shortfalls and customer feedback. We concluded it feels like a mall when walking though the new terminal. Three things need immediate addressing - (1) Men's restroom upkeep and sanitary conditions unacceptable. Need to revisit the options of installing automatic hand blower machines and look at the cleaning schedules to ensure conditions do not deteriorate to the point of being an embarrassment.  Cleaning crews need to maintain a regular schedule on vacuuming the terminal carpet - paper and debris everywhere.  Please explain how the gate flight monitors are controlled by the city? How is this beneficial to the traveler or airline staff? Local control to change/modify the monitors shouldn't even be a discussion. This new terminal is supposed to represent the pride of Kansas City aviation.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

If not working you have to carry your check in luggage. very high escalator, did not see option for stairs and minimal number of elevators.

The airport is broken into a lot of little areas for gates, and of course you can only go behind security in the one serving your airline. It seemed like all of the pre-security restaurants were closed, and in the Delta area there was only one post-security sit down restaurant, which charged an obscene amount of money even by airport standards. The airport itself is poorly lit, with a lot of broken stairs and escalators, and just gave off a depressing vibe. The only good thing is that security was very fast.

2022-07-25,1,10,"""This has got to be one of the worst airports""",J D Baker,"Not Verified |  This has got to be one of the worst airports I have ever been to and believe me I have traveled extensively. From the rude, loud, and verbally abusive TSA agents, the antiquated equipment, slow processing of bags and personnel, and just down right lack of up to date knowledge, this is your first interaction with the Terminal and sets a horrible tone. Then lets move onto the facilities or complete lack thereof. Restrooms are dirty and never maintained or stocked and you have to be skinny, traveling with no bags, and have a lack of smell to even get into and use one if you can find it. Choices for food or drink are limited, outlandishly overpriced (more than other airports), and if you do get anything its stale. Their locations in the dungeon you have to stay at until you board your plane give light to the complete lack of forethought by whomever designed this. Now you need a seat to wait for your plane. That too is horrendous, toxic experience with never enough, and the one I did find to sit in today at SW Gate 43, was sticky and there was a smell coming from the area around me. Decided to stand for the last hour until boarding. I will need to detox everything from my bags to myself before I step foot into my home. Not to mention complete detail my vehicle afterwards. Add to that there are not places to recharge your electronics at your seats like all other airports for your long stay in the cold, dark lifeless tunnels of a terminal unless you crowd around a small area with 1 or 2 outlets, like cows waiting on the evening trough meal. I see they have started a new terminal, but of course the designer there too was either stoned, blind, or has no architectural class whatsoever. And whom ever approved this so called improvement must have pockets lined with gold. You build a beautiful new terminal and then tower a gaudy concrete parking structure in front of it to hide what little majestic magic you were trying to show off. I was once proud to say KC was my home, but if this is the best foot forward you can show to our many visitors, returning Missourians, or International Flyers, then you should be removed. There are two pieces of sunlight that do exist in this total train wreck of an airport. (1) The rental car facility and staff still remain top notch. Whether spending big bucks or trying to save a few I have always be treated with grace, humility, and kindness on the buses, counters, and car parking lots. (2) Gate agents for SW and Delta (only two airlines I use) are always friendly and eager to help in anyway. Kansas City Airport (MCI) you need to seriously look over your customer service, facilities, and architectural managers and make a complete overhaul. Unless this is the look your are going for, draining the customers of all money, life, and happiness at which case you have nailed it.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2022-07-15,1,10,"""the most poorly organized and dirty airport I have ever been in""",Dennis Bills,"Not Verified |  This is without a doubt the most poorly organized and dirty airport I have ever been in. Here is a recap of my Kansas City Airport adventure. As the bus from the rental area drops you off at terminal C (American) door C10, you enter the building and can see overhead placards to the left and to the right both listing ticketing and gates. As my flight indicated C84 I headed towards the ticketing to the right. I dragged my bags nearly 1/4 mile around the curved building edge which obstructs your ability to see any distance beyond a hundred feet or so. After 8-9 minutes of walking I stopped dumfounded as the ticketing area that was revealed around the corner was Spirit and Delta. Not American Airlines. I completed an about face and walked all the way back to the C10 door. I double checked my ticket, double checked the sign and sure enough gate c84 was in fact the direction I headed. With no other choice I went the opposite direction and found the American Airlines ticketing center approx 150 yards in the opposite direction of my gate. Needless to say I shared my experience with 3 AA employees one of which was a supervisor. There is old used toilet paper on the ground right inside the terminal as you pass security. The restrooms haven't been cleaned in forever as is evident by the horrible urine stench, puddles of urine on the floor near the urinals, crusted urine stains on the toilets, the garbage is overfilled and used paper towels are spilled over onto the floor. As you walk through the terminal there is garbage on the ground, horribly stained carpet, food debris on most seats and literally piles of what appears to be mud/manure on the floor where someone had scraped their boots in the ground. Pretty sure I found the true origin of Covid.

Long TSA lines, long treks to the gates (now it is about a 2 minute walk from check in to TSA). Separate TSA checkpoints at each cluster of gates means you get through in 5 minutes or so.), We are not a true hub. We don't want a hub. We have plenty of flights and the airlines compete for our business, resulting in lower airfares. The city stopped routine maintenance to strengthen their case for a new terminal.

There was no communication indicating this was happening so we got into a very long security line with little time to spare. Then the TSA agent scanned and took both my luggage and backpack aside for an internal inspection of all contents. All of my luggage contents were removed then shoved back into my bags without any findings. Approximately 75% of all passenger bags were inspected without any findings. The security line was so confusing with bags being removed and belongings being removed that people were walking away and leaving their personal belongings at security. In a span of 5 minutes, 3 different TSA agents brought over laptops to the gate agent that people left behind. I also walked away without my laptop then quickly returned to retrieve it. The TSA agents were also very rude and not doing anything to resolve the long lines or chaotic situation! Once we got through the gate I was shocked to see how absolutely dirty the gate areas were, with trash on the ground everywhere and overflowing trash cans!

There were no signs and she was not directing traffic, but rather sitting in her car blocking the lane we were in. No biggie, due to us needing to scoot over into the left exiting lane. Just as we were merging, she jumped out of her car and began to profusely scream and swear, demanding we stop. She proceeded to allow every other car pass us and then walked to the back of my Uber drivers car to take his license. She did not come to the car nor give a ticket, so I am not quite sure why the explosive language and looking at the license plate. Her level of professionalism was pitiful and completely uncalled for. It was a poor reflection of her position.

The agent then escorted myself and several others to the TSA check point, and explained to the TSA agent that the plane was in boarding process. The TSA check line was backed up. The agent explained they were not equipped for TSA Precheck and we would go through the routine boarding process. I followed instructions removing my CPAP machine from the original case, before placing it on the screening belt. Removed my shoes, and proceeded through the screen machine. I set it off and explained I was wearing suspenders, I was told to go back, another agent came up saw my suspenders, and politely explained to her co-worker I was wearing suspenders. I was told to go back through the screen machine, of course I set it off again. After lifting my shirt and showing the agent once again the suspenders the agent said put your shirt down (I was wearing a t-shirt under the suspenders) so no skin was showing. Another agent than began the long process of explaining the pat down all the while the plane was boarding. The agent commenced with the pat down process. His pat down was humiliating.

Security lines are usually quick and if you don't check in any luggage, you can go from your seat to the curb in 3 minutes, which is un-heard of anywhere else for an airport this size. I will say though the staff here are always kind, professional, and helpful. This includes, security, airline staff, to the custodians. That's where all of the good stops. If you have a layover here, you will want to drink yourself to oblivion. But here's the catch, no alcohol in the terminal area unless you leave the secure area, and then re-enter the secure area by enduring a wait through the security line. Which depending on the day can mean 3 minutes, or an hour+. Food options in the terminal are pathetic. There are food kiosks that charge the most expensive prices on food and water I have ever seen in the U.S. Since you have no options, they know you are trapped. And as a result, you have to pay $4 to $5 for a bottle of water. Don't try to use a restroom after you go through security. Use the restrooms before going through security. You may not be able to relieve yourself in time if you try to use the one stall within the security area. The airport itself appears to be a fallout shelter with glass all around. It's ugly, and tired. The terrazzo floors are cool looking (if you are into that sort of thing) however the carpeting areas and seats look and feel tired. This airport is vintage and in need of a re-do.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-04-27,1,10,"""has nothing to offer travellers""",K Ciccone,"The Kansas City International Airport is one of the worst airports I've been to in recent years. It has nothing to offer travelers. There are almost no food options once you arrive for your departing flight. If you happen to fly after 8pm there is absolutely nothing open. No vending, no magazines, no fast food is open or close. The staff at the counter told us we were too early with our bags to check and to come back 1 hour before the flight takes off. Her reason was she didn't want to get our luggage on the wrong flight. Isn't that what tags are for? We came back and stood in line for 20 min and almost missed checked bags. There were people who needed help with damaged bags and found no other place to get help than the check in line! We then had to get our bags tagged then carry them over to a scanner to have them checked. Once you go through security you are corralled in a small area with one vendor. They have water, soda, and sometimes cold food items. There is one bathroom once in this area and no space to walk around. This area is also the exit for arriving planes. The people arriving can't even figure out how to get out of there. Overall Kansas City International Airport was a terrible experience. I will be driving to St Louis next time I want to fly anywhere.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

You have to leave one terminal, catch a bus, and go through security in the the next terminal. If you bought any duty free liquids or gifts in the secure area of your departure airport, they will be confiscated. There is no means to ship anything home if you can't check the items. Once in the secure area of your gate, there is only an over-priced snack stand and no charging stations for electric devices.

2016-04-08,1,10,"""signage is scarce""",B White,"I fly through airports across the country every week so where do I start in my views of Kansas City Airport? This airport would be better suited to serving a small town with one gate and two departures a day rather than a major U.S. city. If you have to encounter KCI, hope that it is a flight stop and you don't have to leave the plane. Signage is scarce as are bathrooms. The airport is dirty, mouldy and smelly. Places to eat and shop are almost non-existent so a layover is unpleasant. Seating in the gate areas is cramped and often you feel ""boxed"" into small rooms. To get from gate to gate you often walk through seating in the gates. The worst part is the people working at the airport whether they work at a ticket counter, restaurant, TSA security, or a gate they range from lazy, rude or indifferent. I understand that this airport is a pre 9/11 design and that creates space issues. However, there is no excuse for filthy, dirty, and smelly facilities, poor and inadequate signage, bad lighting, and rude, lazy and indifferent people. Avoid this airport if possible. It is by far the worst airport in the country.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-02-21,2,10,"""all of the issues remain""",Robert Hirst ,"Just to validate the indifference of whoever runs this airport, in 2016 all of the issues remain as, once you cross security, you can't buy a book and you are pretty much locked into a dark, dank crowded mass of humanity with the main men's bathroom having one stall and the further indignation of the cleaning crew closing it on a Friday night at 5pm to clean. They just don't care here and companies thinking of locating should consider that as I stare at the ceiling at lights either so dirty they don't illuminate anything.

2016-01-24,9,10,"""fantastically quick security lines""",J Johnson,"I was marooned in Kansas City for 7.5 hours recently. The delays were due to east coast weather and a mechanical issue. Frustrating, but something that just happens in my line of work. Here are my thoughts: MCI is a unique design that works if folks are willing to keep an open mind. This airport is clearly a pre 9/11 design because all of the terminals are within sight of the curb. That is the gift and the curse. First, the curse. Instead of having 1 security line per terminal like a modern terminal, they have a security line for every 4-6 gates. This is a gift (see below) but also a curse because it means that the food/drink/shopping options have to be spread out, especially the ones beyond security. Stated another way, there ain't a whole lot to do once you get past security, or even before security for that matter. The gift part was watching the locals get dropped off and walk 1 minute to the ticketing or baggage drop off, the fantastically quick security lines were comical compared to some airports, and the curb to traveler ratio was fantastic for those trying to catch a shuttle, cab, etc. At the end of the day, being marooned sucks. No amount of shopping, restaurants, or gimmicks is going to change that. You're somewhere you didn't plan on being instead of where you planned on being. You could give me 5 star dining at a 3 star price and I'd still wish I was home.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-10-31,1,10,"""process seemed very primitive""",Anurag Dave,"Flew into Kansas City Airport on Southwest Airlines from LAX. I really love the views of lush green countryside as you land into Kansas City. The signs for going to Baggage Claim weren't very good. We struggled to figure out how to get there. Then we asked a security personnel, who opened a door for us (the kind that would ordinarily sound an emergency alarm). The baggage claim area is one of the smallest I have seen of any airport in US. While checking in for our return flight, the airline associate tagged our bags, gave our boarding passes, and then asked us to take our bags to another area for screening. This process seemed very primitive. We were also given a very hard time at this airport during security screening. Since we were travelling with a baby, we had baby food, milk etc, and the TSA person asked us to open sealed bottle. We refused, since once the Pediasure bottle is opened, it must be consumed. So, we had to go through a very thorough pat-down for TSA's peace of mind. I have flown through Kansas City twice, and the security at this airport make it a challenging experience for families travelling with little kids.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
