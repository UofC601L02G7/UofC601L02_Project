Phoenix Sky Harbor is anything but and fails to live up to its false moniker. From baggage claim, it is impossible to find the Rental Car Center on your own because the signage for such could not be found. At 10:30 PM, I could find no airport personnel to help and an airline employee whom I was able to find seemed genuinely annoyed and displeased that I was asking him for assistance. Upon my return, the rental car return was extremely confusing and nobody from the rental car agency could be found to assist me. I just dropped my car and prayed that I had left it in the right spot and wouldn't incur any additional charges. Once I arrived at my terminal from the Sky Train, signage initially directed me to ticketing and check-in, but then the signage abruptly stopped when I reached the escalators and a four-way intersection. I looked all over and there was no more signage to tell me where to go. Another passenger saw my confusion and directed me where to go. Once I received directions, I looked for additional signage in the direction I was sent, and could find none.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Many restaurants were not even open. I travel a lot, and this airport is now near the bottom.  Covid is no excuse because I have traveled much during the pandemic. A few other things.  The charging stations are all on little block tables that are always very crowded. Some of the outlets are so worn out that your adapter falls out or you have to shake it to connect. But usually you can find one that will work There are no outlets in lounge seats at all. Some signs do not show gates in both directions. Went towards the C-Gates and had to look backwards to see that I had to turn left for C1 to C9. I surmised that because I have airport experience but woe to the person who does not.

My wife arrived last night from abroad with our 2 small children, 3 large suitcases, 3 carry on bags, and a large back pack.

After a 24 hour international trip and consoling our four year old daughter along the route by picking her up, she was already complaining of a sore back when they arrived. After all that, my wife had to make three separate trips lugging large suitcases clear across the airport to the parking garage while I helplessly watched our children. At no time did anyone at the airport volunteer to offer any help or assistance. This is fundamentally wrong, irresponsible, and shows complete lack of planning and foresight by airport management in every possible way.

It was September 5th at 4.30 am, and I was heading to Screening zone before heading to the gate. There was a huge line up at that time and they opened 3 lanes for screening. 1 for express and 2 for general boarding. Apparently a screening-machine was malfunctioning in one of the 2 general boarding lanes. Instead of opening another lane to deal with the congested line, staffs merged two lanes into one. That resulted in adding extra 10~20 minutes of everyone's waiting time and limited space for people pick up their belongings after passing the screening line. While I was picking up my belongings after passing the screening-machine, staff said ""you are taking up too much space and not letting others having the space for picking up their belongings"". This was very upsetting because all this happened due to their malfunctioning machine and merging two lanes into one. I had never problem with this kind of situation because I pick up my belongings pretty fast. Lots of people were complaining at that time but staffs did nothing about it and did not want to open another lane to deal with this situation, that was very lazy of them and stupid. There really needs to be procedures to deal with this kind of situation. Otherwise it will happen again and that would be just silly, because this is an easy fix.
