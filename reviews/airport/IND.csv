2024-08-23,5,10,"""security check is a nightmare""",Deborah Lee,✅ Trip Verified | Nice looking airport with lots of great vendors but TSA security check is a nightmare. TSA PreCheck only available on the A terminal side. Airlines don't make you aware of that or let you know there is a quick path from A terminal to B.

2023-10-11,9,10,""" for flying domestically we like IND"" ",Jonathan Titus,"Not Verified |  IND is one of our two main options along with CVG when flying. Both are excellent. Traveling from Indy this week reminded me why I like it. In morning and afternoon there are multiple good choices and most are reasonably priced in comparison to many other world airports, crowds are nowhere near some airports, so it is easy to move around, TSA has always been friendly and efficient unlike some airports, restrooms are generally cleaner than many other airports. We do wish there were a couple of direct flights options to Europe, but for flying domestically we like IND",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2023-09-27,8,10,"""you can do better""",S Elaine,"Not Verified | The directions for the TSA PreCheck are confusing for travelers. When headed to the B concourse gates, the precheck sign points to the right and the TSA Administrative office is on the right, but closed. The sign should read that the PreCheck is on the otherside of the concourse, next to Chick-fil-A. Now, once you get to the TSA Check Point, the sign directs you to the employee entrance because someone turned it around. If the sign is in the correct direction, then travelers would know to join the amusement chains on the left.

However, I wait 45 minutes minimum every time I land here. Usually also have to wait 5-10 minutes, sitting 20 yards from the gate before anyone guides the plane in.

Not a little but extremely loud mechanical tools sawing through metals and wood. Dust coming over the protective walls causing coughing and eye irritation. What were they thinking.

However like amenities and services do vary in traveler experience. Indianapolis Airport is by far the best at everything. It has a casual laid back atmosphere but it’s efficient in all aspects of getting passengers to and from their positions whether you are coming or going. The bathrooms are clean and in working order.

However, once my husband required a wheelchair to get to and from the gates, we encountered a significant and repeated service deficiency. This last trip was not, unfortunately, an anomaly. We called ahead, followed instructions to call again when we were within ten minutes of the airport. No wheelchair. The attendants at curbside luggage called again, and pointed to a bench where we were to wait for the chair. Twenty minutes elapsed; no chair. I asked at the service desk. Another ten minutes and no chair. I finally found one and pushed him most of the way to the concourse when a wheelchair attendant finally appeared and took him the rest of the way. We have not encountered this in any other airport. If we had not had similar, repeated problems at Indianapolis International, I would not complain.

",M Jackson,"❌ Not Verified |  Indianapolis International Airport is great. Since it is relatively new, the inside is very clean and well-maintained. Compared to other US airports, it's significantly less crowded. The waiting areas by the gates are very nice with USB chargers and outlets, and there are many great stores and restaurants in the terminals. Baggage claim is nice and checking in is easy. Before you even go through security, there is a very nice food court. Staff are always friendly and parking is convenient.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

I never dreamed this was possible, so spent more than an hour wandering back and forth on the same floor figuring I must have missed my car. This was while I was dragging three bags and I'm 74 years old.  The first person I asked after 1/2 hour said of course the number scheme was different on each floor. Exhausted, I finally returned to terminal where they told me number and colors identical on each floor. So I found my car on third floor I tried. This can be fixed easily in the future by putting a sign at end of each row facing the center access on each floor (maybe 20-30 signs per floor) reading Color, Lettering, Numbering scheme identical on each floor.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2010-03-28,5,10,Indianapolis Airport customer review,Mark Lee,I've departed and arrived at IND several times but only once at the new terminal. It's quite an improvement over the old terminal. As a departing passenger you'll walk in to your airlines check-in area where check-in and baggage drop is very easy. Then you enter Civic Plaza which is a a food court/shopping area which is open to the public. As you enter Civic Plaza the domestic terminal Terminal A is on your right and Terminal B the international terminal is on your left. I generally fly early in the morning and security is a breeze at that time. After you get into your terminal you can go between the 2 terminals freely without having to go back through security. There's plenty of seating at the gates. There is plenty of shopping and eating on the airside. The food is also very affordable as the airport had to agree to keep the food at street prices with just an extra 1% tax on it. Overall a great place to start and/or end a trip.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-01-25,4,10,Indianapolis Airport customer review,J Chou,Modern new terminal and a pleasurable experience. it is extremely easy to navigate compared to other airports around the country. It is very wide airy and open. Check in is easy and the terminal has many amenities. It feels like a nice food court or outlet store with many shops and restaurants to stop at. The art inside the terminal and concourses are a nice touch. Security is fairly quick and easy. Both of the concourses are identical in design. They are fairly short so no long walks like in Denver. Inside the terminal there are family restrooms and clear signs. Kids can watch their favorite TV show and there is adequate gate seating.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-08-16,4,10,Indianapolis Airport customer review,John Philipps,The new IND terminal is excellent. Built along the architectural lines of HKG airport it is spacious and well-designed. Dining opportunities abound both inside and outside the secure areas and the moving walkways are well-spaced and speedy. The lavatories are clean and open and baggage claim well-lit and possesses sufficient signage. The only downside to this facility is the purpose-built security area which is designed well but still staffed by the TSA which means that the humiliation and incompetence zone includes slow-moving lines constant barking from the agents and inconsistent application of nebulous security rules.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-06-15,4,10,Indianapolis Airport customer review,Mark Georgescu,The new terminal of the Indianapolis airport is now open and is very nice. There are two concourses (A and B) with 25 gates each. The terminal is very bright and open thanks to all the glass. There's a large circular shopping area pre-security that has plenty of room and seating. There is a decent variety and number of shops/restaurants after security for an airport of this size including some with sit down service. The security areas are very spacious and have 7 lanes each. They did have only 2 guards checking boarding passes however in the security section that we went through. My only complaint was there was always a line 5-6 people deep for the mens restroom near our gate. Not sure if they're all like that or not but it seems like poor planning given that it wasn't really all that busy in the airport the day we flew out.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
