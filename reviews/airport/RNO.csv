2023-06-14,1,10,"""pushing everyone through like cattle""",Kele Kaona,"Not Verified | HORRIBLE Customer service. The TSA lady was so rude over an honest mistake and she’s yelling at me and my daughter. She was so hyper-focused on pushing everyone through like cattle that she sacrificed basic customer service. Yelling, barking at customers, making comments while walking past me without any regard for my response. AND she barked at a fellow co-worker in front of everyone. Really set the whole mood for our trip. Thank you TSA.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2023-01-02,2,10,"""management must be terrible""",Tracee Lorens,Not Verified | The personnel are rude everywhere-from check in areas to security to everyone except janitorial. The management must be terrible for it to be so pervasive. Very slow day at airport so it’s not overwork issues. Example. At head of security line signs tell you to await next green light. Then agents yell (for 10 minutes I saw) what do you think my arms that long or hurry up-when their lights are red. Which federal rule do you break? Should you be harangued and abused just because you’re politely following signage?,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2022-11-28,10,10,"""great customer service""",Kylie McIntosh,"✅ Trip Verified | Upon arriving home after a lovely Thanksgiving trip, I patiently awaited my luggage at the Southwest baggage claim. My bag is very distinct and when it didn't come through, I knew it was elsewhere. I took my baggage claim sticker over to the office and the staff were absolutely wonderful. He kindly assisted me and had a genuine demeanour that reassured me my bag would arrive later. He told me where it was and when it would arrive. Later in the afternoon, he called me right at the time he said he would to alert me of my suitcases arrival. When I went to pick it up, he was so kind and polite to me! I appreciated his enthusiasm and positivity. He is truly a wonderful example of great customer service. I wish all airport staff were as welcoming.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2016-03-29,9,10,"""spotlessly clean""",Diana Winkler,"Great airport. Very easy to find everything, spotlessly clean, and nice decor. The TSA employees were very efficient and friendly. I was flagged at TSA precheck for my bag to be hand searched because of a binder in my bag. The agent looked through the binder and repacked my items. I was still through the security fast. They have helpful announcements periodically. TSA called people over the loudspeaker when someone had forgotten an item at security. One announcement was for a granola bar left behind. One of the best airports I have been to in a while.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2010-08-22,4,10,Reno-tahoe Airport customer review,E Mabley,Flew in and out of RNO on Southwest. The terminal layout is compact and easy to navigate. There are plenty of slot machines but unlike LAS there aren't so many that they take up too much floor space and leave not enough room to walk past. Smoking is also not permitted anywhere inside the terminal which is a nice change from LAS. The food/beverage/shopping options in the gate areas are limited but there is a nice food and shopping court in the main terminal area before you pass security. The rental car facility is just across the street from the terminal so there are no time-consuming shuttle rides. The airport is only 3 miles from the city centre and traffic to/from the terminal is usually light. The TSA screening area however is too small and understaffed for a 25-gate airport. If you're travelling at peak times expect long lines and delays.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
