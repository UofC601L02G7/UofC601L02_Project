2022-08-25,6,10,"""were extremely rude this morning""",Juergen Huebsch,Not Verified |  One of the TSA Security Guys on C were extremely rude this morning. Lack of proper communication was a huge issue. Please tell me politely to not take my small electronics out of my carry on bag (which has always been the procedure before) instead of yelling the words so quickly that I did not have enough reaction time to process what was being said. Patience and kind words were all that I needed. Please work on this.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

The shuttle & parking employees are the best~ especially Theresa! My husband accidentally left his backpack (with meds, computer, & cash) on the shuttle in long term parking today! I drove Back 3 hours later & got it. Everything is there. They were so kind & helpful. Theresa had his backpack in the office. What a relief!

2021-05-23,1,10,"""Staff were extremely rude""",Chris Sullivan,"✅ Trip Verified | Staff were extremely rude. Every part from ticketing, to security, to boarding all spoke down to us customers. Very disappointed in the continued disrespect. Security were also beyond slow. I can appreciate good security, but the airport wasn't busy at all and it took forever as they kept just taking their time.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-03-28,3,10,"""Fort Myers airport is so poorly equipped""",Joan Clark,"Not Verified |  Fort Myers airport is so poorly equipped with bathrooms, enough restaurants, stores that are open, and places to watch TV. There is not one TV in the waiting areas. If there is a delay, there just are no seats available. Breakfast food was not available at 9am. They were out of both breakfast food and coffee by 9 am. The lines for pre packaged food were 20-30 people long. They need to visit an airport like Grand Rapids MI to get it right. Grand Rapids is the same size town and so much more efficient and consumer friendly than this Fort Myers airport. Fortunately, the staff were friendly.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2020-08-13,3,10,"""belittle their customers""",S Hays,✅ Trip Verified |  I think everyone can count on more than two hands the amount of rude experiences at an airport that they’ve had but today’s stood out more than usual! My boyfriend and I set our backpacks down after having gone through TSA already to go grab a bagel which couldn’t have been more than 10 minutes. When we came back to our seats there was a guard standing near our stuff with a dog. We didn’t think anything of it and then he approaches my boyfriend to belittle him in front of other people that you “can’t leave your bag unattended” and “it makes people unsettled”. He went on for about 5 minutes and then told us some other people may be coming to talk to us. All for a backpack ?! What is TSA for if you’re still worried about my bag?! Maybe this airports needs to put signs up saying not to leave bags unattended before they belittle their customers for their unwritten rules. Attached is a picture of the dangerous scary backpacks!,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2020-03-23,2,10,"""This is awful and disrespectful""",Diana Page,"✅ Trip Verified | We are under a pandemic and I am wearing a mask and gloves, respecting 6 ft distance. Workers at security didn't want us to maintain 6 feet and told me they didn't care if we all got sick. one guy called me sick girl and said you decided to fly, you should have stayed home. This is awful and disrespectful. Security needs to be more aware of the part they play in helping keep people safe. Otherwise, they can stay home.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2018-09-30,8,10,"""clean and welcoming""",Margaret Whalen,"Not Verified | This airport is clean and welcoming. The problem I recognize is the preponderance of dogs not being carried or placed in a designated kennel. During my last visit, I saw an emotional support animal lying on the floor in the TSA queue. Three dogs on leashes were seen at the Jet Blue gate. Announcements about dog rules and regulations are made repeatedly but are ignored. Signage would be helpful enforcement is needed.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

No one really connects through RSW so honestly I don't have an opinion on that, but in general, beautiful airport.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2015-01-30,8,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,MG Auerbach,RSW is a lovely airport with plenty of amenities. However I had TSA-Pre status and the lines weren't open so I had to stand in line and go through regular security. Why offer a product that isn't available?,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-01-13,8,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Josh Morrison,Very nice small airport that's the only close one to Southwest Florida. Never had a bad experience in the 5+ times I've traveled round trip through it. It's small so the waiting times are good security isn't an issue at all and they have a few basic amenities. It's not an airport that can keep you busy for long layovers but I don't think there's really any reason one would have a long layover here. If you're traveling to Naples Ft. Myers Marco Island or any of the cities in and around Collier Country this is definitely the best way to do it.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-06-21,10,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Mark Evans,I use RSW each year for the puddle-hopping trip to Key West courtesy of Cape Air. It is an exemplary airport at every level. Parking is well-organised staff are friendly and well motivated (and this includes TSA) the layout is spacious and the food and beverage facilities are good. An all-round pleasure to use.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-05-19,10,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Geir Johannessen,Fort Myers Airport (RSW) is always a good start and end on our vacations to SWFL!

2013-04-23,10,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,S Miller,This is the best airport that I have been to. It rarely has long security lines yet apparently they could get long due to the large maze at the security checkpoint. The parking is very easy to get to. You don't need to take a bus if you are parking for a short time.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 0, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-01-17,10,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Tony Ferro,You can't ask for anything more from a mid-size airport shops in main terminal with 3 gift shops attached! Beyond TSA. checkpoints there are nice shops and a few restaurants. Airport is modern and very clean! Check in is always fast rental car agencies are in a separate building and it is only a few steps away. I just find that sometimes the luggage wait is a little long.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-07-04,3,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,Peter Nakhili,I remember this airport being very small. Not offering a lot of airlines. The security is extremely small. The decoration was nice and very modern looking. It was very clean and organized.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-08-26,4,10,Fort Myers Airport customer review,G McGowan,Flew on Delta out of Concourse C. When traveling with my 7 year old daughter it took about 30 minutes to check bags and clear security which is about the same if not slightly better than Tampa. RSW has a very clean efficient well-lit terminal that I consider to be one of the best if not THE best medium-size airport I have been in. Facilities after security are pretty typical but there is a very large Chilis before security in the corridor that runs behind the ticket counters.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
