2024-08-09,1,10,"""Horrible for traveling with disabilities""",C Barton,"✅ Trip Verified |   Horrible for traveling with disabilities. We had purchased a ticket requiring wheelchair assistance. Upon arrival, we had to wait for assistance, it was not there despite the flight arriving late. A buggy arrived that could not take us to the required terminal. The supervisor was helpful and called for someone, telling us to wait. No one came after 10-16 min. We found out that despite being told to wait, my mom’s name was not on the list of passengers requiring assistance. We then spoke with attendants at the nearby gate. They frantically texted and called as the boarding time for our next flight was looming. Finally someone arrived and stated that she was unable to take us as her shift would end past the time since the terminal was so far away. Fortunately 2 more assistants had arrived with her with wheelchairs (3 people requested assistance). One of them offered to take us. The other guy with the wheelchair left (presumably thinking that we were the only ones needing assistance), so the remaining passengers did not have the help they needed either. The porter that took us to the gate was wonderful, a man from Ethiopia. He ran with my mother in the wheelchair. I had to take the moving sidewalks to keep up with him. We arrived at the gate right as the next flight was boarding. It was extremely stressful. It took over and hour of waiting for assistance, and we narrowly made our connection. I would avoid booking a layover in this airport in the future, unfortunately we’re traveling through again on the way back.

2024-05-17,1,10,"""I'd rather fly through Newark""",B Holmes,"✅ Trip Verified | This is not an airport, its extortion scheme for TSA pre. Avoid this airport for business travel unless you don't need to pay employees for travel time (if you do, then pay the bribe to the TSA for pre-check, you'll save money). Arrive two hours ahead of boarding time if you have a rental car. Security has been a complete disaster for years and has only gotten worse. The line now greets you on the sidewalk outside. Once you get through security, you'll need to fight your way through the mob trying to board the trains and continually preventing the train doors from closing (no TSA Pre will save you here). Congratulations, you made it to your terminal where you must now navigate the miles long slalom course of random kiosks, broken conveyors, food lines, other desperate travelers etc. So that you can stand in the next line at customer service, when you inevitably miss your flight, where an airline employee will complain about the airport with you while rebooking you on a later flight. Then sit down, have a coffee and spend the time waiting for your next flight to go post angry reviews that no one will ever read. Denver is not an airport, it is an elaborate scheme to trap you in their building and sell you garbage you wouldn't need if they could actually get you to your airplane, like a normal airport.

There is so much disruption due to ""construction"" but even on a weekday there seemed to be no hurry to complete the job - no workers in sight. Few restaurants in the main terminal area and those had little or no seating. Outside the restaurants there was even less seating. The arrival sign at the international arrival didn't work. Signs to TSA screening were confusing and misleading, though TSA itself seemed to be efficient. Internal security is a joke - there are few if any visible security officers.

2023-07-31,3,10,"""by far the worst airport""",T Pearson,"✅ Trip Verified |  I fly frequently for both work and personal travel. Across my personal experience, having gone to many different airports DEN is by far the worst airport. I live in Colorado and it is my main and only location to fly in/out of. There are several reasons I rate DEN this way (1) poor signage to find tram/gate/TSA lines - I always need to coach friends and family who are visiting to both enter and exit the airport. They still inevitably get lost. I even still get lost from time to time! (2) Incredibly long wait lines for TSA entry. I have bio clear and TSA pre check. In all my experiences there has always been a long line and it takes at least 30 minutes to get through. This is on a good day. (3) They have sensitive TSA security machines compared to other airports - my luggage is ocassionally pulled for checking and it never happens at other airports. Like I said, I fly frequently and know what and how to pack to get through fast. Things still get triggered and every time they check my bag they find nothing wrong. (4) Disgusting bathrooms with poor design and cleanliness. No room to keep luggage with you in the stall and everything looks and smells dirty. Please take a note from MSP airport - build in luggage cubbies, make sure stall doors don't have huge gaps, and keep some consistent cleaning schedule. (5) Tram setup and dependence. Gates are all far away and you are essentially dependant on taking trams to get anywhere as it's challenging to walk and navigate. (6) Tram capacity levels are low. In the last 24 hours, I had to wait for the 4th Tram to go through before I could find even slight room to get on. I'm not a large woman - average athletic build - and there was no way for people to fit on the prior three trams as passengers were packed shoulder to shoulder and couldn't move to slightly allow others on. A large group of us started to build up at the tram stop at midnight because there was zero room. Not a great experience when you just want to get home. We tried to walk back but an airport employee told us to just use the tram because construction won't allow us to connect to ride pickup area. (7) Poor restaurant options and quality. Food quality and prices are just bad. Again, comparing to other airports you have both your fast food and sit down areas. We don't go in with high hopes for eating, but we have consistently bad food at sit down restaurants in the airport - fast food is what you would expect in terms of quality. (8) Departure exit escalators are limiting. If you take the tram to the airport departure gates, you are forced to take one of total 4 small escalators to get to the level that brings you to shuttles/ luggage pick up/etc. These escalators always have long lines because there is no other way to get to the departure level without going up the escalators or separate staircase - which is challenging with heavy suitcases. Comments are perpetually made about this poor design and one would think there is a fire hazard risk (this is not my area of expertise so who knows). It's just a miserable experience going from line to get on tram, line to get off tram, and line to get on shuttles. (9) Comfort does not exist. I am typically in the United Hub and ocassionally use the United pass, but regardless of how you choose to wait for your flight, you will be sitting in an area that likely isn't temperature controlled, doesn't have enough seats for full flights and is lacking in outlet plugs. I don't recommend this airport.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The employees at this airport act as if they either do not care about their jobs AT ALL or yell at travelers as if to make full use of the small amount of power they have. Security lines here are also beyond ridiculous, with lines frequently running out of the main security hall and down the hallway. It is the only airport that I have ever had to wait over an hour for security at, and this has happened five or more times. I am even a Clear member, and have had to wait over half an hour in that line multiple times as well. The airport has also been undergoing seemingly endless renovations for years now and each time I return it looks even further from being finished. The walking time to gates is absurdly long, with some gates taking as much as 20 minutes to reach from the main terminal areas. The decent wifi is really the only positive thing I have to say about this place.

When the guy noticed where I have to go. He was not happy, that he had to basically go across the whole entire terminal. He was very slow, he was complaining but he got me where I needed to go so I can fly out. That was a solo part. I flew back two days later with my husband.

Never have I been so confused as to the layout and how to find anything. You have signs with arrows going every direction saying all Gates and then north security, south security, arrows going up down left right East terminal etc none of the signage is clear or obvious. I had to ask a security person who was equally unclear and vague and could hardly speak english. After going through the 85 minute long security line which started all the way at the beginning of baggage claim, wrapped around all baggage claim areas ( blocking people) into another area where you had to walk past the skinny little dividing wall with barely enough room for people to roll their carry-ons, people trying to get their luggage had to cut through the line. The serpentine line literally filled up the entire floor of the bottom portion of the airport. Once you got dumped out after walking through the screening machine they were yelling at you to get out of the way get out of the way while you're trying to put your shoes on your jacket on get your purse etc. And then there was no arrow no clear direction which way to go where to go it was the skinniest narrow pathway having to step over fans and obstacles all in the way to go into an area that's not obvious what that area is. Having never been to this airport before I was unaware of the passenger trains that take you from terminal to terminal. Once I realized that was the deal I figured that out. The lights were out on some of the gate signage signs so it wasn't clear which direction to go once I was dumped out at the appropriate terminal. And to make matters worse as I stood in line to board the airplane for Southwest the signage at the front telling you which row and which boarding group you were in was broken it kept flip-flopping back and forth so nobody had a clue which line they were to stand in or whose turn it was to get in line. Once on the plane I thought was home free but no the pilot seemed to be lost when he was on the tarmac he went all the way to one runway then did a u-turn and it seemed as if we were going in circles maybe there was a change in the wind direction and that was necessary but seems sort of odd that you wouldn't know which way to go.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I returned from London through Denver International Airport (DIA) - one of the most modern airports in the USA. Total chaos and incompetence. This was my 4th international arrival this year but my very first ever at DIA. I pity passengers having to deal with this mess in the future. It was horrible; a mess of chaos, poor design, and execution. If this is a preview of summer travel, God help the travelers. We landed on a United flight from London Heathrow. United scheduled my connecting flight for about 90 minutes, which should have been enough time to make the connection. We even landed early. The trouble started shortly after leaving the plane. There were two escalators going to the next level. At the top of the escalator everyone was funneled into a small doorway (wide enough for two people) in a very small area leading into a massive corridor. There was a logjam at the top of the escalators; people could not move forward but the escalator kept bringing people up. I had one foot of space between the escalator and the person ahead of me. I was pushed into the back of the person ahead of me, quite forcibly by the guy behind me. Pretty soon more passengers were banging into others, some ladies fell, and other passengers tried to keep new arrivals from falling. Very dangerous, unnecessary safety breach. We made it through the doorway to be in a corridor with probably well over 1,000 people milling about. (I later learned that 12 international flights landed in about a 45 minute period). The line abreast was about 20+ people and 200 yards long ahead of me, pretty much at a standstill. We moved slowly toward some unknown destination. At the end of this mess was one entry point that could handle a few (2-3) people at the same time. Passengers were jostling to get into the entry. We then noticed this entryway was for a serpentine maze of about 30 twists and turns. Looking behind me I saw the crowds getting bigger. After 20 minutes I came to the end of this queue. Get this - it led to one exit staffed by one (1) Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officer. OHer sole function was to look at your passport cover and point you right (US passport) or left (foreign passports). Seriously. How stupid. Despite numerous signs telling passengers to have their passports ready, many passengers didn't. Instead of telling them to step aside, the agent patiently waited for them to go through their luggage to find it. A second agent stopped by for a minute and then left. Why not have signs way, way back in the corridor to avoid this? I took the escalators down to another massive queue. More waiting. Finally interviewed by a CBP officer. This didn't take long. Claimed my bag, rechecked it, and then wondered into another abyss. We had to go through TSA security again. I have PreCheck - I saw signs for it but not for the entrance. People were looking everywhere for the entrance. I ended up having to backtrack 100 feet to find a not so obvious sign. Six people ahead of me. None, again, none of them had PreCheck but were just as lost. The agent was in good humor when I made it to him - his comment was something like ""Wow, an actual PreCheck passenger!"" I think poor signage had a lot to do with it. I made it to my gate just as the plane was boarding.

Almost everything about this place is bad. TSA check in is an absolute nightmare. TSA precheck line had maybe 500 people. Non-precheck had 2 lines with maybe 1000 people each. Everything is dirty. Especially the bathrooms. The airport has the feel of a Soviet-era prison without all the glitz. Sure, most airports today aren't fun. Weird TSA security layouts, understaffing, closed facilities. It's just the way things are. Denver takes it to another level. For example, the rental car facilities are dirty and understaffed. I waited almost an hour and a half in a rental car pickup line before I cancelled the car, walked out, and took Uber to Colorado Springs. The on-site gas station was unbelievably filthy with trash spilled all over the ground. If you're arriving on an international flight and have bags, you have to collect the bags and transfer them. This process is standard. At Denver though, you have to collect your bags, take them upstairs and outside to a curbside pickup, then return inside and downstairs to go through security. I might be able to overlook all this if the airport weren't in Colorado and 30 miles from downtown Denver. If you get stuck at DIA, you're spending a lot of time and money finding a hotel or a new wait out of the state. It's just not worth it. Play it safe and use SLC, Vegas, or Phoenix.

At least he apologized when I complained about booking a terminal length to go through his line on the south. Finally through TSA and down the stairs to very backed up and broken train the terminals. After three trains I was able to get one to the C gates. I charged to the gate with a few minutes to get some water for my asthma which was now flaring up from all the people, the humidity in the terminal and my perspiration soaked mask. I asked where the water was to fill my bottle and was told it was 30 gates away back in the center. I did not want to risk missing boarding so I went to vending and found one machine half empty with only pepsi and mt dew. No water. In desperation I got a pepsi. Then I went to the restroom - the stall floors were littered, soap dispensers empty. The germiest place on earth is a bathroom and without soap or even hand sanitizer I cannot follow covid protocol.

I've been to many other airports and their security often makes you feel rushed they are moving you through so quickly and efficiently. Denver Airport security was molasses slow. Lots of standing around waiting for your bin to enter the scan device and then waiting again on the other side of the body scan for your bin to complete its scan. So slow! After I went through the whole process I saw 2 main items that would help speed up the process at Denver Airport: 1) Automated return of security bins. Security checkpoints at other airports have automated bin returns which really speed things up. At the faster airports there is a worker feeding them into an automated bin return and they are quickly made available at the start of the line. Denver Airport had workers using very inefficient carts with bad mobility. My daughter and I couldn't help chuckling at a worker that was slowly navigating a cart with a stack of bins bumping into doors and other items as she struggled to slowly steer the cart from the end of the line back to the start. 2) Have travelers separate out items into different bins with no layers for security scan. Security checkpoints at other airports have you place your electronics in separate bins with now layer/piling of items on top of each other. For example, in Seattle they have you remove your laptop(s) from your bag. Same for your cell phone and bags of liquids. At Denver Airport they had everyone place everything in one tray each all piled on top of each other. Goo grief! No wonder the guy looking at the scanner had to stare at the screen for ages! It took forever. Extremely inefficient and slow for no good reason. Whomever is in charge of security at Denver Airport should take a trip to some other airports and pick up some efficiency improvement ideas. It would go a long way in getting travelers through their security area more quickly. The would also likely need fewer security stations, less equipment and fewer security workers. Aside from the slowness and inefficiency at security, the rest of the experience was fine.

DIA is a monstrosity. Arriving, it took forever to find a way to get to baggage claim - I walked the terminal over taking the train as suggested to avoid crowds but there were no easy ways to get back down to baggage claim, eventually took an elevator. The RDA train to the city is super convenient, but the escalator to get down to it had a closed sign blocking it with no alt offered - eventually found an elevator to take me down. Departing was a nightmare. Getting off train, no easy signs for where check in is, but it dumps you at United, which had lines out the wazoo for everything. Security was snaked for miles and miles. I would hate this airport in particular if I was flying United - on what should be a light day of travel, long lines for everything, most not distanced. I actually had to stop and look up where Southwest check in was on my phone - never have I been unable to navigate an airport based on signage alone. TSA was a nightmare. The north security has shorter lines but I, like many others in front of me, had bags pulled for extra screening. I waited an additional 20 minutes for this check, bunched together with others. They had to check the pockets of my backpack, which were filled with coins and other random junk and has passed through TSA screening at least 10 times with everything in it with no extra search needed. I then darted off to the train to get to the gate and, not being familiar and with no signing, I accidentally got off at the A gates because A51 was prominently called out on my boarding pass - but actually gate was C42, that was just my boarding position. Absolutely no signage or announcement about airlines are at what terminals and every terminal looks exactly the same. I barely made the flight - I was the last passenger on.

On November 19, 2020 my nephew and I flew from BWI-DEN to connect to DEN-EUG to visit my son on United Airlines. Upon arrival at Denver International Airport, I was shocked to see so many travelers not practicing social distancing. It looked like a regular day at the airport pre-COVID where no one was practicing social distancing. There were lines at the eatery, Smash Burger in particular, where there were no social distancing guidelines and the patrons did not take it upon themselves to do such. What was more distressing was that at the sitting area at the gates there was no signage as to be 6ft apart or the seats with the signage to be 6ft apart. Some travelers did not have their mask on or did not have their mask on properly - meaning over mouth and nose. It did not look like security was reminding people to social distance. There was even one man strolling through the airport with the mask in his hand swinging it back and forth. CDC and other health officials have warned about traveling safely during the holidays. I did not feel safe at Denver International Airport! While at this point I do not know if Colorado has mandated strong COVID prevention practices, I will say I was surprised that travelers were not taking precautions. Please note that until there is a way to slow down the infection rate of COVID-19, I will not be going to or transferring planes in Denver, CO. Stay informed. Wear a mask.

Gruff and mannerless TSA agents, even by TSA standards (then again, it is Colorado, which is arguably one of the U.S.' least friendly states). Even TSA Pre-Check passengers wait longer than in Pre-Check lines in other airports, I can also attest to how terrible the lines at DIA are for non-Pre-Check holders.

I got there later than desired, but was still going to make my flight. However, as I was going through the Tsa screening (I had my stuff on the belt, next in line to go through security), my lane and a handful of others stopped operating. This was around 5:00pm on 10/18/2019 The TSA officers made no attempt to explain to the people in line what was going on. Instead, the officers in my lane kept laughing and cracking jokes about ""the supervisors not doing their job"". They should be more sensitive and considerate of all the anxious people waiting to get to their flights. One guest in the lane next to mine remarked that his plane was leaving soon and he might miss his flight, to which the officer sarcastically replied, ""That's unfortunate."" without even giving the guest a glance. Another guests 2 kids had passed through the security gate right before the machines stopped, so he approached the officer after about 10 min and asked if the kids could come back through to stand in line with the parents so they wouldn't be waiting alone. The same officer mentioned above replied in an aggressive manner that ""they've been randomly selected and they'll be selected again when they come back in."" What he's saying is not wrong. It's how he said it that rubbed me, and undoubtedly the father, the wrong way. You could tell the father was annoyed because he simply didn't want his kids to be alone. My negative experience was mainly due to 1 or 2 officers, but there is obviously a work culture that tolerates this kind of behavior. There were other officers around that said nothing to correct the abovementioned officer's rude behavior. I have traveled a lot in my life, and can deal with a bit of rudeness, but this was over the top. Please, train the officers to be better people, which in turn will make them better employees.

We got to the airport with plenty of time to spare because I knew from previous experience how long and time consuming security can be there. The first thing we did was stop at the rest room right by security. The people in front of us in line informed me there wasn't any toilet paper in the stalls. I was hoping they were misinformed but they were correct. There was no toilet paper. There was a woman with a TSA vest on in the restroom. Someone in the restroom asked her if she could let someone know there wasn't any toilet paper and she blankly looked at her and walked away. I was very surprised to see the security line wasn't very long! My 18 month old son has special needs. He has a feeding pump and has Cerebral Palsy therefore he is unable to stand or sit on his own. The TSA agent wanted our stroller to go through the conveyor belt machine. I told the agent I'd rather push it through so I would have someplace to set down my son while I gathered our things after they came through the belt. (I knew I'd have to hold my son but wanted to be able to set him down afterwards) She said no. She then took off all 3 of the stroller wheels and crammed it down so it fit through the machine. My son and I walked through where we were supposed to be and waited for our things. I had a backpack, laptop, my sons diaper bag, my sons feeding pump, my shoes, my keys, my phone, and my stroller without wheels to get after it went through the conveyor belt. So I'm standing there holding my son, who I can't set down anywhere wondering how I'm going to get all of this stuff back where it needs to be. Eventually I asked one of the TSA agents if they were going to put my stroller back together. I got a blank look and he went back to what he was doing.

An extremely long level flight at minimum altitude followed before we reached the glidepath. Taxiing to the terminal was delayed again due to ""traffic"" - we stood on the taxiway for aeons with engines running. Entering the arrival concourse we found a long walk to the end of a huge crowd of arriving passengers queueing for so-called immigration. Coming from an efficient home airport we were overwhelmed. Even families with small children had to stand. If you had to go to the bathroom - forget it. We arrived at a few self-check machines where we had to type in lots of info plus give fingerprints and face photo. A slip was issued and we were so naive to think that was it - like at other airports in the world, and only customs would follow. No way. There was another queue (sort of like what cattle go thru at the slaughterhouse), even slower. When we were at the front, to our surprise, we got to an unfriendly (we had know they are from many previous US visits) inspector who did not bother to speak loud and clear. He wanted all the info the machine had asked just before, plus fingerprints, this time including the thumbs. We had the impression foreign tourists are a burden in this country. The baggage had long been removed from the delivery belt and put aside. The whole procedure took 100 minutes from aircraft door to baggage claim. The signage that should lead us to the TSA checkpoint was poor. TSA - long lines, we got to the front a bit faster as we were business class. The whole checkpoint was a complete zoo. Due to the new full body scan you had to remove the complete contents of your pockets, handkie, notepaper everything. Then the train ride - more or less swift. The departure gate was not friendly and inviting, not enough seating and poor shops. The airline refused to let us wait in the first class lounge as we were not members.

Today I asked for a cart to take me to Gate 89 due to an injured foot and had to wait 30 minutes, then they could only take me to gate 60 and I had to walk rest of the way as they said it would take 45 minutes for wheelchair. 29 minutes before my flight they changed my gate to 56 so I had to walk again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

After reading reviews on this page I had low expectations for Denver Airport, but was pleasantly surprised. Arrival was smooth, and baggage claim quick. The TSA line on a US holiday morning was about ten minutes. The concourses are wide with lots of seating an natural light and a good variety of shops and food. Returning a rental car took time, especially waiting at the gas station near the airport but this is a big airport. It's one of my top US airports along with MSP and Tampa.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

That would be ok if it was an airport that grew and needed one but this place is out in the middle of nowhere. Expensive charges for rental cars. If I need to go to Denver I will try to go to Colorado Springs and drive - it is usually faster and much cheaper.

We spent a fortune in parking and extra fees just to fly to San Antonio, where parking was a fourth the cost it was in Denver. It only took us 20 minutes to go through bag check and security in San Antonio and it was just as busy as DIA when we went through. When we returned to DIA, our plane sat on the taxiway for 48 minutes waiting another plane to leave our gate so we could deplane. This was my third round trip through DIA and if there's any way I can get around it, it will be the last.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The security line was longer than I thought possible in my wildest dreams. There was a market style food place on concourse B that had salads that were actually very good. That was a plus. Overall this airport is a lot of show and feels overwhelming and tricky to navigate. Something really needs to be done about the security line. It's completely demoralizing and inhumane to have to stand for two hours and then strip.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Due to a lack of maps/signage I was confused as how to get to the main terminal, finally figured out that the train is on the lower level. Information desks not staffed on a busy Thanksgiving weekend, asked several airport retail staff, and they either did not know, or gave wrong directions.

2015-11-25,3,10,"""two thumbs down from me""",J Hammond,"If you are passing through, this airport is fine but if you have to drop somebody off or pick somebody up it's a lousy setup. The only free passenger pick-up area is called the ""cell phone waiting lot"". That means you park yourself about a mile from the airport and wait for whoever you are pickup up to call you. Then you get into the revolving circle, and you better hope your loved one is standing on the curb. Even in the middle of winter, they better be out there because if you try to stop for more than a few seconds to look/wait, airport security is going to rush out and tell you to keep driving. ""Wait, sir -- I see my 68-year-old mother right there on the bench through the window."" ""No, no,"" replies security, ""keep driving...she needs to be out here. Keep driving"". Seriously, this is such a mess, it is infuriating. Then, after creating this mess, the airport sees a way to make a profit off it. Yes, introduce valet parking ($12/hour) or actual passenger pickup parking ($4/hour). Total rip-off. So while the airport is kind of cool, it still gets two thumbs down from me.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-11-23,10,10,"""able to get around it pretty quickly""",Justin Campagnola,"Denver Airport is a good airport, and we had no problems. I always fly through Denver. True, it is a bit far from Denver, and the Security lines are a bit long but it is still good. Check in was 5 minutes, there were hardly any lines and I flew through in mid-afternoon. Security was about 10-15 minutes which was good. Despite Denver being a big airport, I am always able to get around it pretty quickly. I did not have any delays when I flew, and have hardly had any delays in the past. There are some good food options, we went to a Mexican place on Concourse C. The rental car stations are far from the terminal though, thank goodness we don't have to rent a car. While I don't use the rental cars, make sure to set aside a good 30 minutes just for the rental car part, when departing and arriving. It can take a long time to get from the terminal or to the rental car, or also to some of the parking areas. Parking is always good, with lots and lots of spaces. Driving to and from the terminal, you can see a large multiple story parking garage, with parking areas scattered throughout the terminal. The employees at DIA are friendly. (The employees at Denver, not always the Flight Attendants). There is lots of art, and lots of room, compared to the always crowded airports around the US. I recommend flying through Denver, as it is very clear where to go, with the signs. DIA is fairly organized, and clean as well. Flying through it often, I have rarely had any problems at DIA.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2015-10-03,4,10,"""20 minutes minimum of wasted time to my trip""",Jeff Krueger,"Pikes peak shuttle, complete waste of time so poorly designed. I arrived at 6.55 am, 6 busses at west entrance, 2 more headed easterly. They appeared to travel counter clockwise, I drove to D4 and parked at 6.58. Both the easterly busses drove past as I parked. Next bus arrived at 7.07 am. Exited West entrance standing room only at 7.31 - it took us 24 minutes to travel this last half of the loop, not even a full loop. Several passengers left behind last 3 stops - bus too full already. Four busses parked at entrance still. Honestly, that many busses and staff on standby is a waste, and why are they not alternating entrances and exits? It makes far more sense to alternate entranced by even / odd number bus and just drive a one-way through to each side. Arrived terminal 7.39 waited for passengers to unload didn't get off bus until 7.43. I'm a frequent business traveller this added 20 minutes minimum of wasted time to my trip, but mostly aggravation at witnessing such sloppy logistics repeated over and over for me and others. It's not rocket science. DIA wifi - very android unfriendly. Not Mac friendly.

But, there is a huge but, DIA is very busy because it is the biggest city between Chicago and LA route. Being said that, I always put 4 hours aside when I am flying out of DIA. Reason? 1) DIA is 45 minutes from downtown (Almost 1 hr from Southern Suburbs). 2) During winter times, there is always an accident on I-70 W or Pena Blvd. 3) Now, you would say what 1 and 2 has to do with DIA? Yes, but they are part of the problem. And the major thing is, there is always a lot of people flying out of Denver and TSA will have only 2 or 3 agents checking boarding passes/IDs. I mean, c'mon. You want us to miss our flight? On an average, security check takes 35-40 minutes (Did I say, I fly every 4 weeks?). This is just ridiculous. On Christmas day 2014, the security line was about a mile long and there were 2 TSA agents, only two. I just don't understand, a big, beautiful, organized, airport like DIA is so behind in moving passengers quickly? Anyway, that is my rant. Everything else is fine. I wish those security lines would move a little faster.

2015-07-15,3,10,Denver Airport customer review,Marilyn Badolato,"This is addressing the passenger pickup. I have flown in and out of DIA hundreds of times and yet on Sunday, 7/13/15 at 6.30 pm the ""traffic cop"" was clearly out of line and making it impossible for passengers to actually be picked up. She would not allow the cars to stop. This was so absurd I nearly laughed but became furious when she made my daughter drive around once and then again almost a second time because I wasn't actually in the lane of traffic. I know there is not waiting and now parking but there is absolutely no excuse why a car can't actually stop to load the passengers and their luggage. These rules need to be re-addressed.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
