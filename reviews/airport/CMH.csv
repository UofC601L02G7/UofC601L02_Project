2024-05-25,1,10,"""look into these problems""",Terry Snapp,"✅ Trip Verified |  Returned from vacation to Columbus, OH., May 22, 2024, at 7:30 am. United Airlines. Gate 38. I had requested a wheelchair when booked returning flight. None were available, Agent at desk said they would call for one but it would be several minutes. After a 5 hour night flight from San Francisco, I needed to use the bathroom immediately. Had to walk a distance, without wheelchair, to closest one where I found one with 2 working sinks out of 4. No wheelchair or staff was in sight until food court area. (At the airports in Maui and San Francisco there was always staff available to assist you). Finally found a unused wheelchair (no staff). We then traveled to Baggage Claim area. We needed an elevator to go to lower level. Poor signage of where the elevator was. (sign was on the side wall, none in direst view). At passing the security check point, the entry security line was backed up to the escalator. I am sure many were upset and worried about not getting to their gate on time. Once retrieving our luggage, still seated in a wheelchair, I had to wait for my husband to get our parked car (green lot). While waiting outside, the cars, buses and airport cleaning truck exhaust became overwhelming. I could not breathe and began a coughing fit. With a new proposed airport building, I hope the administration look into these problems and finds a solution to these many problems.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2022-12-13,7,10,"""Always enjoy how easy it is to get in and out""",J Slice,"Not Verified |  CMH is a nice mid-sized airport. Always enjoy how easy it is to get in and out, as I park in the garage that allows direct access via an underground walkway. It's seldom crowded, though I've had the occasional long wait to get through security. I will echo another reviewer's comments about the rudeness of some TSA agents. The young lady helping us load our trays with our personal items, shoes, etc. on our most recent trip was actually quite pleasant. However, some male agents on the other side of the x-ray machines were harsh and disrespectful to travelers (including myself). One in particular seemed super disgruntled, and lacked basic communication skills to boot. Unfortunate, given the customer-facing nature of his job. On a previous trip, I can also attest to the fact that my wife underwent a pretty intense pat down because she was carrying baby formula through security with our child...maybe this is typical protocol nowadays but I think she was surprised by an agent searching inside the underwire of her bra (something we hadn't seen/experienced when traveling with our first child). Food options, as others have stated, are pretty weak. There is Starbucks available, if you have the time to wait in line a while during peak hours. Overall, I think it's great for flying in/out of my hometown, but probably not much to get excited about for someone passing through.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2022-05-09,1,10,"""checkpoint guards were yelling at customers""",G Warren,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible experience. The security checkpoint guards were yelling at customers and speaking to them in the most disrespectful possible ways, for no apparent reason at all. Customers were very shocked and upset. I'm from NYC and have never seen professionals speak to customers in any context in such a hostile and unhelpful way. Completely unacceptable.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2022-04-22,3,10,"""all the restaurants close by 7.00""",J Blake,"Not Verified |  Decent airport as far as security lines and accessibility, but otherwise just annoying. Pretty much all the restaurants close by 7.00. We were lucky to find a vending machine with a sandwich in it. Baggage claim is also always slow.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The ""Food Court"", which consists of one cheese steak franchise, was closed. United had flights coming in and the counter was closed. It looked like it was 2am. I even tried to get a coffee from the one vending machine and there were no cups. The baggage took over an hour because they were short staffed. The airport screamed small town.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2020-07-08,7,10,"""Columbus has a good airport""",Arnie Goyal,"Not Verified |  This is a good airport! The cleaning can be improved, but I do like the layout, it's not a very very long walk but it is long if you ask me. I go here for my vacation flights, instead of having to drive 6 hours to the nearest true international airport. Overall, Columbus has a good airport! Would definitely fly here again.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2017-06-27,9,10,"""great midsized airport for easy travel""",C Barlow,"✅ Verified Review | John Glenn International is a great midsized airport for easy travel. The terminal was recently (2016) renovated and is very clean, bright, and modern. There are many dining options now that weren't present just a few years ago. One of the best things about it is the free WiFi and charging plugs for every seat in the waiting areas. Overall, this is one of the best airports I've traveled through.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
