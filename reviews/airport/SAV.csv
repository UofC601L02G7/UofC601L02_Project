2022-10-20,9,10,"""Way to problem solve Veronica""",M Kerivan,"Not Verified |  Shoutout to Veronica, ground transportation dispatcher. After a very long day of travel from Nova Scotia I finally arrived at Savannah airport a little after midnight only to find that no Uber or Lyft rides were available and there was a very long line at the taxi stand. When I got to the window where Veronica was managing a list of ride requests, I learned that the wait was 1 to 2 hours. Empty taxi's dribbled in and veronica, always with a smile bellowed out the next name on the list is all directions. People were growing impatient with the pace and the next taxi to show up was a mini van. After exchanging a few private words with the driver, Veronica changed strategies, put her list down and bellowed anyone going to ""fill in the blank"", in my case downtown, ""hop in"". I got a ride with 2 other fares in a van after only 1/2 hr wait. Way to problem solve Veronica. Everyone wins including the taxi driver who made a few extra$$. In case anyone wants to know the issue was related to a train stopped across the main roadway access for over an hour.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2021-10-02,4,10,"""I’ve never felt so insulted""",Jessica Richardson,"Not Verified |  SAV Airport is the only place to rent cars from, the process seems seamless but it’s not. For people coming from a flight directly to the airport it is but for locals it can be a headache with the parking of their actual vehicles. The woman at Thrifty counter was beyond helpful she made this experience so seamless and easy. The lady at the exit point for ticket collecting was rude and unprofessional. I’m usually a nice person but she had the nerve to say this is why people need to know how to read when we were trying to exit following the directions given to us since we had to cross load our vehicles. I’ve never felt so insulted.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'October 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-04-24,2,10,"""It was filthy""",TT Becker,"Not Verified |  Coming from a large airport (Chicago) I was expecting better service and cleanliness in Savannah, GA. The security employees were pushy. Unfriendly, and rude to my three young sons as they were walking thru security. We arrived at our gate, only to find food and wrappers all over the ground. It was filthy. For a Saturday, we were surprised to find restaurants closed. I'd choose O'Hare and it's massiveness and cleanliness over this airport.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-04-10,2,10,"""There was no one to meet us""",Lisa Bacigalupo,✅ Trip Verified | I had requested assistance the night before our flight. There was no one to meet us when we initially arrived to head to Las Vegas and even though our entire flight there and back home the other airports had someone to meet us. When we flew back home no one was there to meet us and we had to wait for them to find someone. From now on we will choose another airport to fly out of and into.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

",K Edwards,"✅ Trip Verified | I loved Savannah but will never return because I never want to step foot in this airport again. Not only was every single food option closed at 8pm, the vending machines were broken as well. Literally the worst airport ever.

After a few minutes of asking what I needed she finally actually looked at the claim ticket saying I’m sorry that’s all I need.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2014-10-22,10,10,Savannah Airport customer review,Richard Hodges,Flew in to Savannah/Hilton Head International 29 September 2014 and departed 13 October 2014. Once again an absolute pleasure to use. My wife and I use this airport frequently when we travel to Hilton Head Island South Carolina. On arrival my wife goes straight to the car rental desks (about 25 yards from baggage reclaim) and I get the baggage from the belt. Baggage retrieval usually takes 10 minutes or so and by this time the car rental formalities have just about been completed. The cars are just outside the Terminal doors and in about 20 minutes we are on the Interstate. On departure checking in with United Express is a breeze after handing back the rental car and then there is a very pleasant courtyard with retail / café outlets before going through security. Even through security there are a surprising number and variety of eating and drinking outlets with a few retail shops. Usual caveat - if you have a late departure they may not all be open. If only all Airports were this charming and nice to use.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-10-10,10,10,Savannah Airport customer review,Richard Hodges,Chicago O'Hare to Savannah and return 9 October. Have used Savannah / HHI International for many years when flying to Hilton Head Island SC. A really very pleasant little airport serving mostly Delta and United Express internal flights. Friendly check in staff quick luggage retrieval and absolutely the best Car Rental desks - just 50 yards along the same floor from Luggage Retrieval with the cars park right outside the Terminal. This is a relatively small International Airport but there is a pleasant courtyard with a couple of shops and eating choices with lots of tables and chairs and a great information desk. Once through security there is a surprising range of nice eating choices BUT of course they may not necessarily be open for a late night departure. Have used many USA Airports over the years but this (and Reno/Sparks in Nevada) is the gem - would unhesitatingly recommend.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
