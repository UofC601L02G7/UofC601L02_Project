Sadly, my wife misplaced an expensive item in a washroom not discovering it until we had passed through security. We asked staff for assistance and the people we spoke to were awesome. They took our phone number as we're only there 1 day but recovered the item before we even left the airport.

Sat for 45 minutes on the tarmac upon arrival and then was delayed 3.5 hours on departure. Once we boarded, we had to wait another 45 minutes for someone to put gas in our plane. Baggage claim was a hot mess. Multiple passengers getting only some of their bags. We needed to wait for two other planes to unload their luggage before getting our second bag. Hundreds of people waiting for flights that disappeared from flight boards. Lines of customers waiting to speak to service agents that came and left the area without explanation or serviced people outside of the established lines. There was another desk with three uniformed staff members carrying on conversations amongst themselves and a sign stating the desk was closed. Sassy, condescending updates far and few between.

Arrival: waited 20 minutes on the tarmac for a gate to open, waited another 20 minutes at carousel for baggage (even after a bathroom stop!). Departure: Absolutely pointless agriculture inspection (agents don't even look!), Long line at security checkpoint, EXTREMELY rude TSA agent at escalator, our gate was not marked in main hallway - had to hunt and peck to find it, boarding agent was nothing short of a jerk, and this is the most rundown airport I have ever seen.

When we first came, the airport was wide open, no real gates, no real baggage claim. Now, there are buildings but it is unwieldy. As an example, the United counter is at the far right end of the terminal, TSA is then 2/3 of the way to the left. Your first very long walk. No pre-check. Very limited food options when you finish with the TSA. Then what seems like a one mile walk to Gate 1 or 1 mile the other way to gate 39. Very few moving sidewalks especially in the lower gate numbers. OGG really needs updating and a better design. Less walking. More food. Better security checkpoint. The airport is recommended only because there is no other way to fly commercially to or from Maui.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

So many passengers in the airport missed their flights, I bet it must have set a record. Some airlines like American delayed their departure, but of all airlines, you’d think Hawaiian would have delayed theirs, but no. The airport was filled with passengers who missed their flights on all airlines due to the ineptness of the airport. This needs to be addressed. This is a disgrace!

2021-08-05,4,10,"""Staff were extremely rude and obnoxious""",Brian Mccain,"Not Verified |  The airport itself was nice but the TSA was horrible. Staff were extremely rude and obnoxious. If you asked any questions about the process they mocked you and made you feel stupid even though there were no signs posted about what you can and can not bring on a plane. I was told by one staffer that bottled water has never been allowed on planes since the beginning of time, which is a lie. The floors where you have to walk barefoot was very dirty and sticky and they treat you like cattle, yelling and pointing at you like a prisoner. They would throw your carry on luggage around like a beach ball.

2021-07-23,1,10,"""Disorganized, slow, unnecessarily aggressive""",John Sarzier,"Not Verified |  Very old and out of date but TSA security was insane. One line for everyone. One agent interrogating a 3yr old and 5 yr old as to their birthdates, their siblings birthdates, their parents birthdates, where their parents worked, etc. Have they never met a child that age? Kids were scared to death to answer and the agents were very rough and separated kids from the parents. They did this to at least 4 families I witnessed. Disorganized, slow, unnecessarily aggressive, and despite having at least 3 screening machines, only ran one. I hear the residents are mad so many tourists are coming to the island at this time as it’s a burden on all their water and food supply. Keep treating visitors like this and you won’t have to worry about it. The rest of the world will open up and, like me, we will go elsewhere and Maui can figure out another income industry.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

People eating with masks off everywhere in waiting area. Another man was coughing everywhere with no mask on and no one enforced any rules. No wonder Maui's cases have been going up. I understand the laid back vibe of Hawaii, but there are times when things need to be tightened up so you don't end up killing others with a virus. This was worst case scenario for me.

This time, I was with my young daughter. The counter attendants literally walked away as we were checking in and didn’t come back! Then the machine printing baggage tags malfunctioned and since they had left, there was no one to help us. Finally the guy directing our places in line felt bad for us and asked one of the other attendants to help, and she made a really big deal about coming to the other side of the counter to help us! At the gate—no stores. I had bad heartburn at this point so I wandered back to shop for an antacid or something and left my daughter with our stuff at the gate. No luck, only jewelry, souvenirs and a restaurant, so I approached a security guard to ask—and lo and behold I crossed the “magic line” (that’s what he said!) and was out of the security zone. Many tears ensued as my petrified daughter had to find me and schlep all our stuff along to give me my boarding pass so I could go back through the TSA screening and then they forgot to tell her I needed my ID so we went through it all again, now we are getting really close to being late for our plane and my poor daughter is alone up there as I frantically try to get back to her (of course no one could help me get through the now-huge line any faster to get back to her).

TSA agents shout at passengers continually, they are so verbally abusive to all. They pull your bagage apart in a rough manner and shove things back in in a very messy way. Nowhere to sit to tie your laces after taking your shoes off. No Nexus line. No smile from anyone and certainly no please or thank you.You wouldn't know you're in a US airport.

I flew in and out of OGG during a week-long vacation with my wife, our 2 young boys and my parents. The terminal concourse is spacious, but the décor is dated, it's not the cleanest, there aren't enough ladies' restrooms (so says my mum) and the food options are sorely lacking (limited to one snack bar and one restaurant serving terrible food). The bag claim and TSA checkpoint are both outdoors, which makes for spending a long time standing in tropical heat and humidity. The airport is also right smack in the middle of the most congested part of Maui, so there is often a backup on the surface streets leading to the terminal. OGG does the job, for now, but it is in need of a terminal refurb, an expansion to bring the TSA and bag claim indoors, and a widening and improvement of the roads leading to and from the terminal.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The airport hotel we stayed at the first night did not send its shuttle bus on a regular schedule and there were no phones to call hotels so we asked staff at the information desk if we could use theirs.

There are inter-island connections to the other islands which was the only advantage HNL once had. If you want to shop go to one of the stores on Maui not the airport.

Queues for immigration are the usual TSA story - too many passengers being screened by understaffed security check points.
