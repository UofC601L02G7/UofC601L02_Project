2023-04-15,1,10,"""never use this airport again""",E Marten,✅ Trip Verified |  Long lines. Unable to hear employees calling for flights that need passengers to skip to front of lines that are 1 hour long. Missed my flight because they can’t communicate with passengers. I was literally there in line. I got a call asking if I was going on the flight. I confirmed I was but was waiting to check my bag. She told me check bag time for the flight ends 45 minutes before departure and it was too late for me and to find a representative. I cut everyone in line and spoke with a lady at the counter who said they announced for all people on my flight to go directly to the counter ahead of the line. I told her no one in line can hear anything they are saying. She said that’s what she’d been telling her coworkers. After she confirmed I couldn’t get a new flight for 2 days I sat and waited for my ride to come back and get me and I then witnessed an employee walk around and shout the names of 3 destinations whose flights were needing to have customers go to the front of the line immediately to check in. I was furious because had it been done sooner I could’ve been on my way home with my seven year old who was sobbing because he couldn’t go home to his dad. I will never use this airport again. I am so frustrated.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-01-09,2,10,"""they have inconsistent rules""",Heather Evans,"✅ Trip Verified | Very small airport which is not necessarily a problem. The problem we have every time we travel into or from PGD is that they have inconsistent rules nearly every time. We have TSA pre-check which we paid to obtain. At all other airports this allows us to leave our shoes belts and light jackets on as well as laptops and ipads in our bags. Not at PGD. Even though they hand us a piece of paper that identifies us as TSA pre-check travelers we have to remove belts, jackets and laptops/ipads nearly every single time. It is as if the TSA agents at PGD went to completely different classes than every other agent in the country. Not to mention how rude some of them can be about it as well. I really try to avoid this airport as much as possible.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-04-09,1,10,"""minimal places to sit""",Marlene Reilly,❎ Not Verified | They should spend more money on putting gates in the airport instead of a multi million dollar resort. Plus there isn't any place to eat and minimal places to sit. When a full plane comes in and you have to stand for a minimum of 1 hour it gets pretty bad - at least for seniors.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
