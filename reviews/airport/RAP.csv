2021-01-20,1,10,"""I will not fly Allegiant out of Rapid again""",Jeri Nelson,The woman taking care of boarding was very rude and overbearing. She made me pay $50 for a carry on bag. I have a small under seat bag that I use all the time and went under the seat when I sat down. I asked a flight attendant if the bag was alright there and she said yes. I was told that she is not well liked by Allegiant staff and I can't imagine why she is employed by Allegiant. I fly Allegiant all of the time but usually go out of Grand Island and they are wonderful. I will not fly Allegiant out of Rapid again. According to passengers this happens all the time.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
