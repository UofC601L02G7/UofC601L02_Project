2024-08-17,10,10,"""compassionate and dedicated"" ",Brenda Letts,"✅ Trip Verified |   I can’t express enough how grateful I am for the exceptional help I received from Hilary, the gate check agent at Spirit Airlines. I was in a complete panic after losing my cell phone at the airport. With no way to contact my family and let them know when I’d be arriving, I was extremely stressed and worried that they’d be concerned about me. Hillary noticed my distress and went above and beyond by offering to let me use her personal phone to send a quick text to my family. Her kindness, thoughtfulness, and willingness to help me in a moment of crisis made all the difference. Thanks to her, I was able to let my family know when to pick me up, and I could finally breathe a sigh of relief. Never did find my phone but there was a silver lining. Hillary truly saved the day for me, and I can’t thank her enough for her generosity. Spirit Airlines is lucky to have such a compassionate and dedicated employee. Thank you, Hillary, for turning a stressful situation into a manageable one.

The D concourse appears to have more amenities which appear to have more amenities than the B concourse. The concourse is bright and spacious. Departure was from B concourse. The B concourse has only 2 restaurants and lacks amenities. Slot machines take up most of the space at the gates which makes for a very crowded gate area. I didn't notice any in seat USB and/or power outlets. The B concourse needs major renovations to align it the modern and spacious terminals you see at other airports.

Well, the seats have huge metal arm rests to prevent sleeping, so the gate was full of uncomfortable people trying to sleep upright. Then they have loud rock music playing nonstop.

The TSA agents kept giving me conflicting instructions. Take off your shoes, you can put your shoes back on if you walked through the K9 area, put your shoes on to walk through the metal detector. It made absolutely no sense and when I acknowledged it I just received blank stares from them. The conveyor belt stopped working because someone’s bag jammed it because the TSA agents failed to tell the person to put their bag in a tray. I watched them watch the person put the bag loose on the conveyor belt and then fail to give them correct instructions. Then as they were trying to fix the jammed conveyor belt a TSA agent came over to where I was and said that it had stopped working because a tray was still in the tray dispenser. I don’t believe this had anything to do with what the problem was, and there were trays sitting in other tray dispensers, but they decided it was the one in front of me that was the problem and gave me stern look. Again, that makes no sense, my tray didn’t jam it. They need to improve their system and communicate better with each other and with people who are traveling because we are not mind readers. I see this happen a lot with incompetent employees, they can easily blame the customer for a problem. In this case it really seemed like the TSA agents were causing problems for themselves. What would a person gain by not following instructions and delaying their travel time at the airport?

This is the worst practically new airport I've seen anywhere in the world. I don't know what the casino revenues collected in Vegas, or even the airport itself, are going toward, but it sure isn't toward having a meaningfully modern, efficient airport, despite the many years and dollars spent on revitalization. For the pros - 1) Baggage claim was actually efficient. 2) Signage inside the airport was ample. That's about it. As for the cons? 1) There is no efficient means to take a rideshare or taxi, as the wait for either can be over an hour. It took me 40 minutes and I felt lucky compared to the people around me. 2) There's no effective means of public transportation to the Strip and this is considering that the airport is practically on the Strip! Not even a monorail. 3) The terminals have mostly new, though very depressing and uninviting, architecture and design. 4) The terminals were poorly lit, in both the late evening and early morning. 5) I saw a tiny handful of anyone working in the airport who smiled, or who otherwise just didn't look angry. 6) Airline (baggage claim) and security personnel were almost entirely ill-mannered and officious. Not just ""having a stressful morning and need coffee,"" but flat-out rude. 7) Apparently this airport doesn't believe in automated check-in and baggage machines, even though they're chock full of them, Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc. weren't operating theirs, and required their passengers to stand in long lines (of course, if you checked in in advance and have no baggage to claim, this isn't a problem for you). 8) LAS is just a really dirty airport overall, plain and simple. 9) Practically nothing was open in the airport at either 9pm or 6am, I guess this isn't a huge deal to me only because we're still in the midst of a pandemic. I understand that LAS has to interact with a never-ending array of passengers who don't even understand clear airport signage or etiquette, but I would respectfully suggest that LAS look to Salt Lake City (stunning new airport with overall great service) or even Phoenix (which is above-average but not great) as examples of how to operate a respectable airport.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We spent the night in the freezing airport due to AA incompetence and got nothing but hostility from nearly everyone we (politely) approached for help or information. When we were finally put on a plane with the help of one American Airlines employee, I witnessed at least four other passengers being treated terribly for no reason. It's like they are trained to abuse their clients. The icing on the cake was the 2 AA cabin crew members getting into a very loud fight in the back of the plane. The tension on the plane was palpable. I've never experienced this in my life, and suddenly the news reports about passengers flipping out on planes seemed understandable.

",M Richards,"✅ Trip Verified | McCarran International Airport (Las Vegas) is one of the worst airports I have ever had the displeasure of using. Where to begin? The only good thing about this airport is it is very close to the city center. Otherwise, it's loud, crowded and uncomfortable. No matter the hour, loud rock and country music is playing. No place to escape the assault on your senses. People are crowded into gate areas that are too small with inadequate and uncomfortable seating. People are sitting and laying all over like in some post-apocalyptic scene. The rental car shuttle consists of smelly, old diesel buses with rude personnelle that yell out instructions. The food choices consist of over-priced fast food. Once again, inadequate seating in the restaurant areas. Huge lines to everything with more rude people treating passengers like cattle.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Our luggage carousel had three flights of luggage on it from three different cities. On return trip the airport was deserted at 3 pm. My biggest complaint is the men's restrooms on Concourse D were filthy. Some urinals (perhaps 1/3) were out of service. There was an attendant floating around that did not appear to be doing much to improve the situation. I was appalled at how bad the floors were.

My experience was so miserable it makes me want to scream. And thanks a million to the staff member that threw out my lunch! I have been traveling with appropriately sized containers to make sure something like this didn't happen for years, yet now my less than 4 oz container is now more than 4 oz and you want to escort me an hour back in time to the back of the line to keep the container? At the very least the staff that couldn't figure out how to scan my boarding pass and told me I needed to go back across the airport to reprint it could have been more polite (and after protesting, another staff member at least tried the pass and got it to work).

2017-04-03,3,10,"""the staff (TSA) were rude""",Julie Thompson,"Other than a very nice woman working in one of the essentials shops, the staff (TSA) were rude. The woman at the ticket counter asked me if I wanted to push the retractable handle down on my suitcase or just have them break it when loading. Then, there was the escalator ordeal, which involved a backup of travelers at the top, where TSA security screening is located. A female employee was positioned behind the ropes where people step off the escalator, apparently, to instruct people to move right upon exiting. However, her screaming, and I am not exaggerating for effect, was creating more confusion and hesitation, resulting in a moment of panic for those of us that were trapped in a momentary crush. Perhaps some signage at the bottom of escalator or recorded overhead audio instructions would help, especially for the elderly or physically disabled. TSA directions guy, same experience. Yelling and pointing, as if he were conducting traffic control at the scene of an accident. His accent, combined with volume and hand gestures, made it all the harder to understand. The lady behind me asked, ""what does party of 4 mean?"" He was actually yelling ""podium 4"". Lastly, if a customer inadvertently packs a banned item in carry-on bag, such as brand new bottle of hair product, there is no need for a lecture (yes, I got one). A simple ""sorry, but this is not allowed"", will suffice. And no, I don't feel the need to walk along to the garbage can to watch it being disposed of, just let me go on my way (possibly this is policy). On a positive note, cleanliness, amenities and seating comfort was excellent. The airport itself, is one of the nicest I've been to.

The huge arrivals sign was convenient to show where Arrivals should go, after a 2 storey escalator and one small baggage claim later, we were out of there. When we returned to depart later that week, we turned up one hour early so we had to wait an hour before check-in. Seating was adequate and comfortable. Check-in process was fast and effective. One confusing thing is that I was travelling with a friend and I got exempted for TSA Pre Check. So we had to split lines and Wait for him after security. Overall smooth and efficient. After that we went to a small restaurant the east end of the terminal. Quick bite to eat and was delicious. Gate boarded efficiently and on time. Adequate seating while waiting for boarding call.

Plenty of shops and restaurant options, whether you want fast food or gourmet they got it, want to shop for quality perfume or maybe a magazine for the flight, it's all available here.

We got dropped off at the Terminal 3 entrance (we flew Frontier) and I kid you not, within 30 minutes, we were checked in, screened through TSA (their agents were incredibly friendly and humorous) and shuttled to our gate through the people-mover system they had. I was most definitely blown away by the efficiency and level of service that McCarran had to offer. For a big-city airport, it certainly had a small-town feel with the high speed of check-in and high quality of service. It was worth driving 200 miles one-way from Southern California, as opposed to driving 80 miles to LAX.

The security process which does take too long in most US cities was up to the excessive time scale I have become accustomed to. However luggage handling collection was much improved. My negative experiences on my last two trips has been the very low standard of the counter staff at the airlines check in desk. On this occasion she insisted on me having a China visa in my passport to visit Hong Kong which is not required. I showed her my HK resident card but she insisted on a visa was dismissive and ignorant of the visa requirements for entry and refused to check them. Eventually she checked myself and my partner - but at other ends of the plane even though we checked in very early. This was corrected elsewhere. American and United airlines seem to have the most rude check in staff. Happy with the others.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
