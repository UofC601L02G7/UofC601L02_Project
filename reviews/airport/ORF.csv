2016-10-02,7,10,"""always a pleasurable experience""",D Roberts,"âœ… Verified Review | I have been flying out of/into Norfolk airport my whole life and have always had a pleasurable experience with it; this time was no different. The Southwest check-in agent was very friendly, as were the TSA employees at the checkpoint. My bag got flagged as a possible explosive, but luckily they figured out it wasn't. A major plus ORF has to offer is its new bathrooms, which were installed less than a year ago. These are sleek, modern, and well-maintained by airport staff. The terminal itself reflects the era it was built in, with smaller windows and lower ceilings than, say, SEA. Instead of inducing claustrophobia, though, it gives the entire a building a more ""cozy"" feeling. New seats at the gates with electrical outlets are also a major plus, allowing you to charge your phone while you wait for your plane. One downside of Norfolk International, though, is the WiFi. It is very hard to connect to and hardly works. Aside from that, though, this is a small, practical, no-frills airport that is impossible to get lost in and is located near the Norfolk Botanical Gardens (another positive).",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'September 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-11-29,1,10,"""airport is dirty and falling apart""",Mike Jones,"As someone who's travels constantly for business, Norfolk Airport is honestly the worst airport I have ever been through. I have traveled through here well over a dozen times and not once had a pleasant experience here. The ticketing agents are rude. The TSA are frustratingly incompetent. The airport is dirty and falling apart in many areas. If you have any other option of airports I suggest you use it.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-07-18,2,10,Norfolk Airport customer review,Lauren Yearsley,"This airport was dirty and dilapidated. The terminal I was in was in the middle of an update, but they didn't do much to try to make it look okay in the interim. There are very few food options (for some reason they are all outside the terminal so, so you'd have to eat before going through security if you want something edible. The person who gave me my lackluster bagel was very rude and mumbled the whole exchange. The prices at the food places are even more exorbitant than expected. The check-in, arrivals, baggage claim, and security were mostly fine, but once you're passed security, don't hold your breath for good service.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2007-11-28,4,10,Norfolk Airport customer review,S MacLeod,It is a second tier (non-hub) airport so traffic is lower. As others have noted it is surrounded by a botanical garden so the setting is beautiful. Recently all of the food options were significantly upgraded. Security moves quickly and efficiently. The arrivals area is large and conveniently located next to the parking garage for a quick departure. Rental car counters are right in the arrivals area. Which brings me to the only negative -- waits for checked baggage are noticeably longer than almost any other airport. Figure on a minimum 30 minute wait. Would recommend getting your rental car while you wait on your bags.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
