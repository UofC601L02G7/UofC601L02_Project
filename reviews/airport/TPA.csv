I don’t think I have ever come across such a rude check in staff as the lady that was checking in the BA flight to London on 31st May at F gate. We were business class and we had our passports and e tickets. She shouted at us to leave the queue as we had the wrong tickets ( or that is what she thought ) we were confused as had used them earlier, she made us feel awful and when we said we had both e tickets and paper she said we had to use paper, with that she snatched them out of our hands, rolled her eyes and huffed, she then passed them on to a colleagues whilst we stood there waiting for one of them to give back both our tickets and passports. There had been no communication or advise when we checked our luggage in that you had to have a paper boarding pass. In this day and age it seems very out of date.

Every other group did a full refund or at least full dollar credit for future purchases, since the cancelation was due to COVID and govt reaction: airline, 3 shore excursions, cruise line, hotel. The only deposit we could not fully get back was parking at Tampa International. Of the $90 charge, we got back only $45. Tampa airport used to be the best airport in the country. Since Lopano took over, it has gotten progressively less customer-focused. Maybe Tiliocos, VP of Customer Service, has something to do with it? I emailed those two and the Feldman, head of parking. Obviously they got my emails, since Feldman, head of parking, called me to tell me personally to bugger off. Of the $5K for the trip, 45 is peanuts.

2018-04-04,1,10,"""a total disaster in terms of customer service""",N Gordon,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been traveling through this airport since the early 1980's. The airport was clearly well designed from the start with a central hub supporting multiple airsides via automated trams. The system worked and worked well for many years. After 911, the main long term parking terminal was closed and a remote long term parking garage was built away from the main terminal. It wasn't a great solution, but the shuttle buses ran quickly and delivered you right to the correct airside. Later, the original long term parking area was reopened with increased pricing. The new remote site was renamed ""economy parking"", though at $10 per day it was hardly economy. But that price was better than the $18 per day of the reopened long term garage. So, for many years I would park in the economy garage then ride the shuttle to the main terminal. From there I would check-in at curbside and take the tram over to my airside. Recently the airport has undergone major revisions which include a monorail system that joins the economy garage to the main terminal. Also, a new centralized car rental facility has been built which is next to the economy garage and also served by the monorail. The result is a total disaster in terms of customer service. I don't know who designed this mess, but I can tell they have no idea how to move people through an airport facility. First you must find parking in the economy garage, which isn't easy because the space inventory system is now broken. There used to be signs that would tell you how many spaces were on each floor. Apparently the new construction broke that system, so good luck finding a space. Next you have to take the elevator down to the first floor, even though the monorail is located on the 4th floor. Then, you drag your luggage to the middle of the garage road and jump on the moving floor system. Yes, they mounted the moving floor in the middle of the garage's shuttle roadway. Not on the sidewalk (where they have plenty of room), but right in the lowest part of the garage where surely the Florida rains will short circuit the machinery. The moving floor thing will slowly take you to the opposite side of the garage where a new elevator systems has been installed. Where next? No problem in deciding, there are only 2 floors to select. So now you go back up to the 4th floor to wait for the monorail. And wait, and wait. There appear to be only two trains and one was broken. Once on the train, prepare for a wild ride. First the train drops 4 floors and accelerates as it follows the access road to the main terminal. People and luggage fly about as the train dips and weaves at high speed. I'm sure injuries have already occurred due to this new system. As it approaches the main terminal, the train climbs quickly and stops abruptly at the station. If you've survived this far, you must now drag your luggage to the escalator for a trip down 3 floors. Now good luck finding your airline counter. If you're flying Southwest then you're in luck, it's the first one you find. Other airlines are scattered around and the signage isn't so good. Prepare for a lot of wandering around. Once you check-in, you now ride another escalator up and find that you are nowhere near your airside tram station. So, more walking to find the correct station and ride the tram over to your airside. In my case, the airside has been redesigned (which means less space and more expensive restaurants).",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Very smart of Tampa to put smoking areas after security checkpoints. Smokers can go through security early, find their gates and go for a smoke instead of waiting until the last minute to try and get through security. It also alleviates stress and irritable passengers if flights are delayed, etc. It is such a simple solution to create a win-win for smokers, non-smokers, and employees alike. It does not affect non-smokers at all, and instead creates a calmer environment.

Been quite a few years since I last used this airport - no queues at BA check in and through security in 5 minutes. Clean and good variety of shops and eateries landside. Looked ok airside but did not shop as used the International Lounge for BA customers. This was a disappointment - comfortable seats but food selection dreadful - a few curled up sandwiches that were not replenished and a few crackers and pieces of cheese with dips. Poor choice of wine. Not acceptable, Tampa, but from what I read no different from other North American Lounges. Apart from the lounge will use Tampa again certainly better than Miami, Washington Dulles, Newark, Chicago etc.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Now we have a small child we have noticed that there is a lack of any compassion when going through security to get to our gate. We were not offered a expedited queue even thought we had a lot of baggage and had a distressed child (2 years). There were three security lines two for those in economy and one for first class whilst we were waiting in line for nearly 20 minutes (not that bad I know but its different with children). Families need extra time to get all the food out ready and additionally my wife was chosen for an invasive pat down. The priority queue only saw a max of 8 passengers with staff looking around but noticing our frustrations.

2015-02-24,6,10,Tampa Airport customer review,Greg Olson,The picking up of arriving passengers has severely degraded over the years. You'd think after years of inefficiency that they could come up with a solution. I didn't use to have to park or drive around in circles for five or ten minutes to pick up my wife. Lighting for driving in circles sucks for me also because of poor lighting for a senior and confusing outdated signs. Don't even get me started on airport security. I gave up flying years ago. Last time I went quite a while back I wore a t-shirt shorts (no belt) and sandals with no luggage or carry on and still had to endure the long lines and wait. Why does someone like that have to wait behind a women with a huge loaded purse and a carry on. Where's the express lane?

2014-07-20,9,10,Tampa Airport customer review,Tony Wood,Not a large airport which is a good thing. Staff seem friendly and efficient. They were getting people through immigration pretty quickly although I was held for about 30-45 mins because of some problem with my fingerprints but I guess this doesn't always happen. Catch the shuttle to the terminal and the car rental offices are just a short walk away - we were soon heading south on I-275. Two things to note - not many shops airside and Club Lounge is not very big.

2014-06-18,10,10,Tampa Airport customer review,David Aston,After coming to the US some 30 or 40 times we decided to use Tampa as our start off point having tried Boston JFK Washington Philly and Atlanta. What a pleasant surprise the immigration staff were pleasant and even used my first name when asking how long we were staying. Being new to the airport we asked directions from the Customs staff and they were very helpful. The airport is not as overcrowded as most and works quickly and efficiently with limited waiting times. We will use Tampa as a gateway again.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-05-27,7,10,Tampa Airport customer review,M Nal,Arriving at Tampa. Found the immigration polite but business like as I was one of the first of the plane no major lines waiting. Hertz rental at airport walked and picked car at car park. Out of airport in half hour at most. Departing hertz rental drop of at airport needed a trolley had to pay $5 or get a porter for same price. Previous reviewer said it was free at lounge. That is not accurate as they charge $5 through out the airport. Very disappointing. Departure very close to car park. Going to the gate have to pass through another set of security who insist you are not allowed more then two carry on bags. I always thought it was at the discretion of the airline as to how much carry on you could take. As well as paying $5 for trolley this is another first for me and I have been to many airports. At gate you have to go through another security for screening body scanner indicated I had something in my pocket. This was true as I had some $ notes. Security official response was 'when we say remove everything from your pocket we mean everything'. Initially I thought he was joking but as it turns out he was very serious. At gate there were 3-4 food outlets that were ludicrously expensive. $4 for bottle water. There were water fountains available and free internet. Both welcomed. Lounges for BA not fantastic. Overall airport easy to get into and out of clean throughout and not overcrowded. Have to say disappointed with the $5 charge for trolley as I landed at Heathrow and paid nothing. And the over zealous screening security.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2013-12-05,10,10,Tampa Airport customer review,B Walters,Efficiency with a capital E! I have travelled to this airport for 25 years or so and even though it has got busier and bigger it still manages to run efficiently. On arrival my flight announced that it would take 20 mins before bags would arrive on the carousel. I exited the aircraft among the first few passengers and was at the carousel in about 15 mins and the bags were already going around including my own bag. On my return to Canada on Nov 12th the airport was again very busy but I was checked in quickly and took the tram over to airside and lined up for security clearance. Line up looked long but it moved and I was through in about 10 mins. I wish I could say I had as good an airport experience in Toronto later that day.

2013-11-29,10,10,Tampa Airport customer review,C O'Hanlon,Tampa is a great airport away from the hustle and bustle of Orlando it is a much more relaxed atmosphere and is now my choice of airport for travelling to Florida. We were on the back row of a B777 and still only had to wait 45 mins at immigration. Staff were polite and friendly. Bags were waiting once we got through. Car hire is available immediately as you step outside the airport. The only downside is on the return they charge $5 per trolley (non-refundable) in the hire car drop off area. I took a walk into the terminal over the road picked up three trolleys and saved ourselves Â£15!! Check in areas are spacious and there are enough shops / restaurants to keep you entertained for a couple of hours.

Trains take you out to 5 different terminals. Once you get to terminal each terminal has its own individual security so not very crowded and went smoothly. Also plenty in each terminal as well.

It has to rank as probably the best airport I have used in the US.

2010-03-01,5,10,Tampa Airport customer review,P Aigner,My first encounter with Tampa International was 1987 before 911. Tampa International is my home airport which I fly out of several times a year domestically and internationally since 1995. After 911 Tampa was the only airport that wasn't scrambling with the new security measures since they already had many of them in place. As a result their treatment of passengers was very even handed and fair. The airport is a lot bigger than it appears. But because it's designed on a hub system with rays branching out to the individual terminals connected by trams it's easy to get to any of the airsides within a very reasonable amount of time without running your butt off. I've been in airports where I had to run a couple miles on a 20 minute connection to skid into the gate to be the last one to get on the plane. It's difficult to get lost in this airport because of the hub system the clear large and well placed signs and the logical layout. I've been in airports where there are no signs or the signs indicate a straight path when in fact the route is on a hairpin curve up a staircase where the missing sign is hidden out of sight or there's a blank wall where the sign indicates a clear pathway. Also if you are dropped off on or have driven to the wrong side of the main terminal all you have to do is either walk across the building inside to the other side or go to the end of the building and drive around to the other side. Tampa is also a pleasant place to wait. I've done a lot of waiting for my husband to get off work after my flight gets in. Tampa did a major renovation a few years back and improved a lot of areas in the terminal. TSA have their problems no matter where you may fly. However this is one of the few airports where I've often seen the security agents try to make the situation a lot easier for us by being kind and careful with the security checks and some of them also use humor. This is also one of the few airports where the security explained to me what they were doing and why. (The other was Brussels Airport when they were using me as a training guinea pig while I becoming late for my plane.) A lot of them are pleasant and smiling. And not a one of them has ever treated me inappropriately.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}

2009-03-10,5,10,Tampa Airport customer review,J Marshall,My favorite airport. They even do a better job with getting you through security (the TSA still leaves a lot to be desired but the check points occurring airside limits the long waits). Easy to drop off rental car and then go directly to plane no bus involved. The airport is also centrally located.

2008-12-22,5,10,Tampa Airport customer review,M Neave,As a regular visitor to Florida Tampa is my favourite airport to fly in and out of only BA fly here direct from the UK and it is a shame more UK carriers dont. Clearing immigration customs and picking up luggage with minimum delay unlike Orlando or Miami airports also car rental facilities are good and exiting the airport is easy on the Interstate.

Very efficient friendly staff well-planned and simple to maneuver easy parking close to downtown Tampa decent non-stop access. Only small complaint are the food options in the terminals -- if you have a decent amount of time for a layover I'd suggest going to the main terminal for better options as security is (almost always) a breeze. Rarely have I spent more than 10 minutes getting through security. Why oh why wouldn't some US airline make TPA a hub or some European carrier expand here (we still only have the one BA flight for international along with some Mexican/Caribbean/Canadian flights).,,{'Recommended': 'no'}

Immigration was a breeze through in no time. In taxi with bags within 35 minutes of landing. Departure was similar. Slight queue at check-in due I think to difficulties with previous traveller. Security was swift with smiling staff! International Club Lounge very pleasant with lovely friendly staff. At the departure gate we purchased some last-minute duty free items. We paid and were advised that our items would be waiting at the gate for us. We wondered how as the gate was less than 30 yards away and we were priority boarding i.e. immediately. But true enough. I don't know how they managed it but the items were there waiting for us! Excellent service.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-03-27,4,10,Tampa Airport customer review,Patrick Neill,This is an efficient and reliable US airport I actually enjoy going back to. The atmosphere is very relaxed and laid back. People are friendly. In addition Airport management obviously cares for the details as evidenced by such new amenities as free WIFI or a parking lot with arrival displays for cars waiting to pick up passengers. The only pity is that there is only one single international flight to Europe (on BA to Gatwick with spotty transfer efficiency and choices in Gatwick). I think that this hidden gem of an US airports would deserve more international traffic to Europe and could become an alternative for those wanting to avoid the other airports on the US East Coast. How about direct flights to Zurich or Munich. Both offer many onward connections and are far less crowded and overloaded than say London Frankfurt or Paris.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
