2020-02-05,3,10,"""Didn’t try to remedy the problem""",A Martin,"I am deeply disappointed in what Westchester Airport has become. I have flown out of this airport hundreds of times as a business and recreational traveler going back to when it was a single counter and one desk for all of the airlines. While excited to see its growth, my recent trip on January 23rd left me flabbergasted with what I saw and was subjected to. We arrived at Westchester airport at 5.50am on January 23 for a 7.10am flight and didn’t get through the horribly backed up security line until 7am, so we just made our flight. We were luckier than those booked on other flights that were actually left behind. When we arrived the line was backed up to the coffee shop and the pre-check/Clear line was wrapped around the baggage carousel. It was ridiculous. Travelers 2 rows ahead of us had been in line for over an hour since security was barely moving. I inquired with the TSA representative standing in front of the pre-check line why the third belt wasn’t running and was informed it was allegedly “broken”. Although in my travels I don’t ever remember seeing all 3 belts open even when security is backing up. By the way, it was still “broken” when we arrived 1 week later. The attitude of the TSA worker was nothing short of atrocious and exacerbated the problem. As I mentioned, the line was sluggish at best. To complete one lane took over 20 minutes. It wasn’t until passengers started getting very heated with the TSA agent in front of the pre check line that they did something about it. That’s right, they called the police. Didn’t try to remedy the problem, just called for back-up. Her attitude was terrible and she took no action to resolve the problem. When I had spoken with the TSA Agent I had asked why there was a such back up, she informed me that it was now the way the airport was operating and they are leaving 20-30 paid passengers behind daily because they cannot get them through fast enough. This is unacceptable. People had arrived with plenty of time before their flight and were left behind only to be rescheduled. What are you doing to remedy this with TSA? As the 100+ people in line were becoming more and more heated and vocal, the line suddenly sped up a bit. They delayed one flight by 15 minutes and still left about 25 passengers behind. Another flight to Ft Lauderdale did the same. We were fortunate that we made our flight. Does this not present a security issue with unattended bags being loaded and sent on plane without its owner? As I was going through security there were 4 TSA agents huddled in the back laughing, joking and mimicking a passenger that was upset about a 2 hour wait in the security line and missing their flight. Again, unacceptable! I now know why there was a delay, they were all busy chatting in the back near the office instead of helping to move the lines. Needless to say, I am more than disappointed with airport’s lack of remediation for these TSA issues they apparently are aware of and the policy changes. I am someone who chooses this airport as my primary and have added to its growth by continuing to fly out and recommend that people to utilize this wonderful airport. I feel for the gate agents that now have to deal with irate passengers on a daily basis. I’m also concerned about the safety of all passengers with unattended bags being flown. I do hope you’ll receive this with some gravity as this was one of the worst airport security experiences I have had world-wide.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

This is the worst airport I have ever been to in my life. The lack of post-security amenties makes it even worse. It is bland and there is almost nowhere to sit in the ""gate"". It is convenient to land into, but it is a nightmare to fly out of. You are better off going to JFK or LGA.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-03-22,1,10,"""Worst TSA experience""",C Cartwright,"Not Verified | Worst TSA experience ever! I am a corporate pilot flying for a fractional ownership program, with Known Crew Member (KCM) status. I airline weekly, sometimes multiple times a week to commute to wherever one of my company’s airplanes happens to be. Even before my company had KCM, as I would go through TSA at dozens of airports (big, small medium) I would just show them my flight crew badge, place my bags “between the bowels” not take my electronics out, and walk through the metal detectors instead of having my body bombarded by radiation through the X-ray machine. Also, I’ve never had to throw out water which is huge, when you’re flying somewhere to pick up a plane to fly late into the night. (As I happen you only be doing today). Today while airlining from HPN to ATL to pick up a plane, TSA Made me go through security twice (shoes off and electronics out) shot me through with radiation (twice) and dump out my 3 bottles of water, patted me down twice, and swabbed my hands and tested it! What should have been 10 minute process turned into a 30-40 minute process! This is insane! This never happens at other airports, big or small, KCM or not. This is totally unprofessional, and someone in management needs to retrain their agents. Treatment like this can easily cause a pilot to miss their flight, creating major problems for flight companies.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-01-22,6,10,"""Most staff were okay""",C Petty,"Not Verified | Most of the staff were okay. One lady in particular was very pleasant but there was a gentleman at the checkout desk who was unecessarily rude and unprofessional. When I handed him something he practically grabbed it out of my hand. Then, when I thought I was done with him my sister and I are waiting to board the plane. I was tired so I didn’t notice that he was putting suitcases to the side to put under the plane. Even still, it’s not the customers duty in my opinion to be on top of those things. If I was in his position I would’ve kindly alerted the customer that I was collecting the bags. Anyway, my sister noticed so she hands him my suitcase and when she did that that’s when I realized so I handed him mine. Instead of leaving it there he makes a comment about my sister being more attentive than me. True or not, I think it’s out of line to be making those kinds of snide remarks to customers and if you’re going to have a personal conversation with customers I feel that it should at least be something nice. But, that was just the one person so I hope it’s only him.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2017-05-01,7,10,"""nice little airport""",Z Sheinman,"Nice little airport, there are barely any food options, just a sushi bar, diner, 2 convenience stores (all pre security) the only thing that is post security is a tiny place that has yogurt and granola bars to eat for breakfast. No information regarding departing flights. Very small, cramped and crowded waiting area. Upon arrival it took 20 minutes from stepping off the plane to being in my car which includes getting 3 checked bags.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2008-11-16,2,10,Westchester County Airport customer review,T Betenia,Ideal location only short haul flights offered. Terminal needs drastic expansion. Too many flights departing at the same time causing people to be packed like sardines in one terminal. They need to invest and modernize.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
