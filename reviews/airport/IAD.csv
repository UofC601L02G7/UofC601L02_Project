There are meant to be four restaurants, but two of them (Wolfgang Puck and an oyster bar) were boarded up closes. Carrabas was open until they told me the bar was closed. Bracket was the only place to get a beer left, and they have exactly zero electrical plugs. On a long international flight, you need power. I ended going to Volo Vino which had a plug (horray!) but not beer or spirits, just wine. I knew Dulles was a terribly managed airport, but this experience takes the cake. There were thousands of people in the terminal and nearly zero places to sit down and eat. Don’t ever ever fly international in or out of Dulles. It’s like it’s stuck in time from 1960. The reason I rated it 1 instead of 0 or -3 is because it was clean. There are plenty of places peddling their wares of course, but that’s about it.

On a regular Saturday evening in early June, we experienced a half-hour traffic jam because of this decision. The problem will be even worse at peak travel times, with added chaos created by people trying to do end-runs by dropping passengers in the arrival zones. All of this creates enormous stress for passengers and the airport security and support staff. Valet parking is used by very few. In the past, it was available in the parking lot just outside the terminal, without creating any disruption to traffic.

The immigration took forever to complete. Even though the lines are very long, there appeared to be only one or two guys in the immigration kiosks, which together combined made a terrible immigration experience as a passenger. After the immigration was done (finally!) and on entering the baggage claim and arrivals waiting area, I found the area to be poorly maintained and also found water leaking from a spot in the ceiling. The departure experience was a little better. But the security areas made me feel like I'm in a building that is under construction.

With approx 200 people ahead of me and 5 persons working the kiosks it took 1 hour and 28 minutes to get to the immigration. Once there, it took all of one minute to be processed, thus I do not know why it took so long. Once through, it was time to have my carryon inspected...another delay. In the bag, was a bottle of inexpensive rum that I bought at duty-free at my departing airport. It was in a sealed bag, but no receipt attached to it. I think she may have handed it to me and I simply threw it in the garbage. Well, the staff member at customs told me I could not take it. I spoke my opinion of why from that point forward I would avoid this airport and departed one bottle short. Welcome to ""Merricah""! Now, as an airport goes, Dulles is missing something. It is missing a ""T"" at the end of it's name. This place reminded me of something out of the movie Airplane. A place stuck in time. I had a 6 hour layover and that was the most boring layover I have experienced. Simply nothing to do. Typical of many airports, I grossly overpaid for a sub-par meal, but I was ready for that.

As a foreigner in the UK, I was through immigration in less than 10 minutes, as I was able to utilize their automated kiosk, it did a facial scan to match my my face to my passport, then I went straight to my luggage, as I didn’t need to speak with an agent if I had nothing to declare. The entire time, every encounter with an employee at Heathrow was pleasant. I come back to my own country, and I’m treated like a criminal - get herded like cattle to wait in a long line because they only have four agents working, every agent has that arrogant facial expression and body language, and then I get yelled at by the agent because I declared items that I had bought on the electronic form prior to landing. “You didn’t need to do this.” They use facial recognition as well, but a human has to review it - why?

My gripe is about CBP agents. In a word they are arrogant. This is a bad reflection on our entire country for international arrivals. Personally, I used to go thru' IAD at least once a month, often more. Now only occasionally due to covid, and I can report that the CBP agents have had a chip on their shoulder for a long time - once I get pulled aside and sequestered for a random check (they found nothing), and the guy was offensively arrogant and rude. Two days ago I landed after 24+ hours flying and the CBP agent that took my GOES slip was just obnoxious. I am still angry that I was treated that way. His entire demeanor and his body language were overbearing and rude and arrogant. I don't know what it would take for the agents to offer a simple ""good day, welcome to the USA"" or similar pleasant greeting. How about a smile? I know that are in law enforcement, but do not treat us like criminals. If you have to exert your little ""power trip"" over passengers, perhaps a good psychotherapist can help, or why not better training - or just find another line of work.

But there is one aspect of the airport that I continue to find extremely irritating, and that involves baggage reclaim. From time to time they have a person take individual suitcases off the baggage carousel, ostensibly to prevent too many bags from piling up on the carousel - trouble is, from where one is standing waiting for one's bags one often cannot see this person so one is unaware of this going on. This was the case on my return from London on 12th December of this year - I was waiting on one side of Carousel# 20 and my suitcase continued not to appear, so I started walking round the carousel and found this man randomly pulling bags off the carousel, including, as it turned out, mine - had I not started walking round the carousel I would have been quite unaware of this. There was at that time no danger of the carousel becoming overwhelmed with luggage and this random-pulling procedure was thus totally unnecessary.

I've been traveling for 20 years from all over the world and have never encountered this kind of confusion and inefficiency. I was always proud of our customs dept and loved to hear ""Welcome Home"" from the polite and efficient agents. Not this time! Unlike in the past, when US Citizens were separated from everyone else (including green card holders), and received priority treatment and less wait time, we were herded through a process with green card holders and visitors who did NOT read the signs about where their line was NOR were asked to leave the lines by the kids (if any of them were 21 years old I'd be amazed) who were supposedly manning the line. These T-shirted tots were rude, unhelpful and clearly had no clue as to what they were doing. When I asked for an explanation as to why visitors were in our line they had no answer, when I asked to speak to a supervisor I had to wait 5 minutes for him and he was as young, dumb and rude as the rest of the T-shirt brigade. After snaking through this line for 20 minutes, I noticed some of the T-Shirters letting people through to the front of the line. When I asked about that I was told they had ""used the app"" so they got to go to the head of the line while everyone else who were uninformed about this app (there were no signs advertising the app) waited, waited, and waited. When I got to the agent at the desk, he was older but just as ill-informed and defensive about the mess as the T-shirt tots. Finally, got through the line/passport inspection and met up with a uniformed official (and a polite adult) who attempted to explain the situation. He acknowledged that the people with the app should not have been shown to the front as it was unfair since there was no signs saying that with the app you could jump the line, and then he explained that for just $100 a year (each) we could avoid all the mess altogether.

TSA Pre-check is efficient, especially for members of Clear; all Washington-area airports have Clear available. Trains to the concourses are frequent and efficient. One serious drawback is the long slog from the Concourse C AeroTrain station and the actual terminal because the train station is where the anticipated permanent concourse will be - some day. There is no train service to Concourse D, leaving passengers to go by the original mobile lounge system the operates reasonably well. Concourse C/D is a ""temporary"" concourse constructed in the 1980s and not really suitable for the large passenger volume it must handle. Nevertheless, passenger amenities have improved considerably of late, with the addition of several higher-quality full-service restaurants. Passenger amenities in Concourse A/B are much better.

2016-08-17,6,10,"""not great, but not bad either""",E Morrison,"✅ Verified Review |  As some other commenters have noted, Dulles was designed for a different model of operations than most subsequent airports, and the efforts to integrate the design of the airport with current practices can be very awkward. Dulles is a distinctive airport in many ways, so much so that it presents significantly different experiences, based on the particular type of flight you're on, as I'll elaborate on below. For the aspects of travel that are universal regardless of type of flight (check-in, security, parking, etc.), it's decent overall. The new(-ish) train is a big improvement on the old ""mobile lounges"" (which are still used to concourse D, though), I've had mostly pleasant and efficient experiences with check-in, and have even been pleasantly surprised by the speed at security on some occasions. For getting to the airport via car, you definitely need to be aware of traffic and plan travel times accordingly - I've had many painless experiences, but if it's around rush hour, beltway traffic can be ghastly (though the Dulles Access Road itself is usually fine). For domestic flights, Dulles has the best selection of non-stop long-haul flights of the 3 DC-area airports, and it's generally an acceptable experience, concourse A/B is a lot nicer than C/D, though. For myself, if it's a choice between a non-stop from Dulles or a flight with a connection from another airport, I'll take the non-stop from Dulles; if the choice of flight is otherwise equivalent, though, both BWI and DCA are more pleasant options. For departing international flights, the experience is essentially like that for domestic flights - not great, but not bad either. For arriving international flights with Dulles as the final destination, it's below average. The mobile lounges to get to immigration & customs are always inconvenient and almost invariably crowded. I've had both good and bad experiences with the speed of immigration and customs, but the wait for luggage is usually short (if immigration is slow, there might be no wait at all). Since Dulles has the vast majority of international flights of the DC-area airports, if DC is one's point of origin/destination, there usually isn't a choice about which airport to arrive at. For arriving international flights when DC is NOT the final destination, avoid Dulles at (almost) any cost. The slowness and inconvenience of the mobile lounges, unpredictable time for immigration/customs, and the possible need to then take another train/bus to get to the concourse for your connecting flight must be incredibly stressful. To summarize: Dulles is acceptable for domestic flights and international departures, below-average for international arrivals with Dulles as final destination, and to be avoided if at all possible for international arrivals with subsequent connections.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

The international operation is the worst I've ever seen in any civilized country. Coming into Dulles from abroad ranges from cumbersome painful to a nightmare. The whole thing is a hymn to inefficiency and unreasonable design: first people are stuck until saturation into the oddest transportation buses I'm aware of to transfer to another terminal. After many hours of traveling the packing and smell and everything is the least welcoming feeling possible. And one wonders if this is just by coincidence, as to GET to the terminal there is a civilized underground train! That apparently only works in one direction! Then the customs! I've spent between 1 (at least) to more than 5 hours to go through customs. Having a H1B usually my interaction time with the TSA officer is about 10 minutes, so the rest is just standing in line. And after luggage collection, another control (for what?) that can take another 5-60 minutes. I never came out of Dulles with less than one and half hour after getting to the gate. Coming and going for 3 years I'm always hoping that this can only be temporary, there is no way the capital of the US can have such an inefficient, outdated and outright disorganized airport (yes, disorganized, the airport people knows how many flights are coming with how many people, why don't they get enough officers to get things working properly?). But nothing changes. Right now I'm waiting for my wife and our 4 month old kid. They landed 4 hours ago, and no one knows what in earth is happening inside.

I want some rational explanation of why this obsolete, unwelcoming and inefficient system was not modernized together with other updates to the airport some years ago. If there is a train to take passengers to the terminals, why isn't there a train to bring passengers from the terminals? Specific complaints about the mobile lounges - if they must exist, they should at least be designed to load passengers on a first-in, first-out basis. That way, the first people entering the vehicle wouldn't crowd around the entrance, blocking it for others. There should at least be different lounges for business and first-class passengers. Part of what business and first class passengers pay for is the privilege of being first off the plane and thus first into Immigration - the mobile lounges make this impossible. I often take a flight that arrives at Dulles past midnight, and I am often the first person off the plane. But the mobile lounge waits for the entire flight to be loaded, and then even waits for the crew. At that time of night, this delay is inexcusable. Many other airports have expedited lines or services for business and first class passengers, so why doesn't Dulles? If they must exist, they should at least be designed to accomodate the carry-ons everybody uses now - the aisles are absurdly narrow. If they must exist, there should at least be courteous, multilingual staff helping people navigate the absurdity instead of the barking drivers who simply yell ""move back"" when the inevitable blockage occurs - it's rude, unpleasant, gives a poor first impression of our country to foreign visitors, and is unintelligible to visitors who do not speak English.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

When we asked the ""information"" person where our bags were, he had no clue, and when we asked him about what we could do, he still had no idea. Why? He was a ""volunteer"" and only knows about hotels. He said that the airline's counter was closed (which isn't surprising as it was midnight) so nobody knew what to do. Finally we got our bags. To put a person who knows nothing about the airlines or the airport shows high incompetence and it seems that they should at least create a seperate booth labeled ""Hotel Information"", let alone get staff that actually know how to deal with passengers' situations. Dulles isn't the best airport, but not the worst. It has it's ups and downs but the airport is not consistent at all.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2016-06-06,7,10,"""security procedures labyrinthian""",Bill Holmes,"When Washington Dulles was opened in 1963 it was a pioneer of the jet age, located on a huge tract of land that could easily handle ground operations and all kinds of weather and an iconic architectural masterpiece of a terminal. ""Mobile lounges,"" giant people movers, were meant to move passengers from close-in gates directly to their planes. When Dulles opened, the walking distance from check-in to plane was never more than 400 feet. That was before mass travel. All of the original elements operate against the new airport, so walking distances are long and security procedures labyrinthian. And let's not even talk about parking. Check-in is straightforward and security lines work well if you have TSA Pre-Check, less well if you're an ordinary flyer. Aerotrain services to the midfield terminals are good, but the C-Concourse station is built where the new terminal will be someday and not where the existing concourse sits. That gives you a quarter-mile walk to your concourse followed possibly by a lengthy walk to your gate. Aerotrain stops at Concourses A and B are much better. Food, beverage and shopping services are very much improved and are quite good these days. Gate hold areas are inadequate. Arrival is more straightforward than departure. Concourses A, B and C are connected to the main terminal by frequent Aerotrain service - Concourse D uses the less comfortable and outmoded mobile lounges. The only problem with Concourse C (United Airlines) is the long walk from the existing midfield terminal to the Aerotrain station, located where the permanent terminal will go when they finally build it. All arrivals come into a central area from which you may have a healthy walk to your baggage claim carousel. Baggage claim at Dulles typically takes somewhat longer than at many airports, partly due to the stances between the midfield terminals and the baggage claim area. Parking at Dulles is abundant but located a long way from the main terminal. Taxi and SuperShuttle queues are reasonably short usually. There will be a Metro stop at the airport but that's a few years away. Meanwhile, taking the Metro also involves a (not free) shuttle to the nearest Metro station.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

On the way out back to London, it took 47 minutes to get through security. The staff were just standing around and didn't seem to know what they were doing - they were rather rude, officious and as far as I could see completely incompetent.

Also, they use very strange truck-like buses that can be raised off the ground like a crane in order to reach the doors of the terminal buildings. These vehicles are bulky and and militaristic.

Then once you are finally through the machines, you have to make your way through the maze of escalators and halls to get to the right train or bus-thingy to get to the correct terminal. My personal favorite is when you get off the train at Terminal C and you still have to walk 1/3 mile to get to the concourse. Then you have pray you took the correct turn to get to your gate.

Leaving the people mover (and I know I'm in the minority, but I like them), my heart sank when I saw how busy immigration was. Several other flights had arrived at a similar time, including flights from Japan and Qatar, and I resigned myself to at least two hours queuing in the non-citizens section. But that's not what happened. For the first time ever in my experience, the immigration hall was almost fully staffed, processing was quick and easy, and I was through both immigration and customs (more long but fast-moving and well-staffed queues) in precisely an hour. Many of us are often - quite rightly - quick to complain when US airport immigration is poorly staffed and painfully slow, but I thought it worth noting at least one day when Dulles actually managed to get it right.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
