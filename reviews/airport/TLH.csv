2020-02-26,1,10,"""TSA is horrendously unprofessional""",A King,"Not Verified |  As a frequent traveler, this is the worst airport I’ve ever been in. Flights are perpetually delayed with no information given to passengers. Luggage has been left on the tarmac twice and not put on the plane. TSA is horrendously unprofessional. Searched through my entire luggage and strip searched me with no information given as to why I was being subjected to this. After requesting a private room for the degrading pat down, they made me remove my pants to examen my knee brace and then the TSA agent opened the door to the screening room before I was dressed. If I didn’t have to frequently come to Tallahassee for family I would boycott this airport. This is the worst excuse of an airport I’ve ever seen.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'February 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2013-07-07,2,10,Tallahassee Airport customer review,M Williams,I live in Tallahassee and have used the airport (aka TLH) for more than 30 years. TLH is a very expensive local domestic airport to use. It very small for an American capital city. However it is accessible to most people who live within 50 miles of Tallahassee. The current facility is a significant upgrade over our old airport but not worthwhile for the airport construction price paid maintenance costs and amenities provided. Unfortunately I would have to recommend that travellers drive from either Atlanta or Orlando rather than rely on timely and enjoyable arrival/departure from TLH.,,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
