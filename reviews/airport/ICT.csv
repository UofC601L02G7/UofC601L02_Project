2018-04-02,8,10,"""Ample seating in the gate areas""",David Guenthner,"‚ùé Not Verified |  Vast upgrade from the previous terminal. Far more space at check-in counters, baggage claim, and security. Baggage service is efficient. Ample seating in the gate areas. But there are few food options, especially if you are on the concourse after 5 p.m.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-09-05,10,10,"""a very pleasant airport""",O. Gloom,"I have no complaints whatsoever about the new airport in Wichita. Lobby is wide and bright with helpful staff at the information desk. There is a wonderful exhibition on the aviation history of Wichita on the second floor. Go to the airport early so that you can read all the displays. Not a wide assortment of food choices, but good enough. Car rental area is well organized and staff is well-trained. A most pleasant experience there. The signage for getting to the city center and on the highways could be better, but I think that is the responsibility of the city, not the airport. A very pleasant airport to use.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-07-09,10,10,Wichita Airport customer review,Michael Streit,"Nice, friendly airport.  Quick check in usually, efficient security screening, everybody keeps moving.  Gates are easy to find/navigate.  Short on food options, nice bar after security near Gate 4.  Good coffee/bagel bar near Gate 2.  The new airport is about finished.  Will be nice to see the improvements.  Eisenhower is the new airport name - excellent choice.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
