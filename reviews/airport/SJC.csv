2018-01-01,4,10,"""very unpleasant experience""",Marco Fernandez,"❎ Not Verified | As a rule of thumb, we avoid changing money at airports, unless the country we’re visiting isn’t “credit card friendly” or we’ve been advised to use cash for certain purposes. Although Costa Rica is credit card friendly, we read that changing money at the airport is advisable. This was a big mistake. In comparison to the exchange rate and charges at a bank in San José city, we “lost” around 15% due to changing at the airport — this was the largest percentage we’ve lost amongst all money exchangers at an airport. For us, this was a very unpleasant experience especially for incoming new tourists. Moreover, one of our luggage was “lost”, and there was only one person for the airline accommodating — it took us over an hour in the baggage claim/lost and found area.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'December 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2017-05-18,6,10,"""criminal price of food inside the terminal""",G Jones,"✅ Verified Review | San Jose is a small but plucky, tidy and efficient airport, marred by a couple of flaws and bottlenecks. It is modern and adequate for the passenger flow except Upon departing, the early morning flights (6 to 7.30) cause the security line to grow enormously, though it is processed in the most efficient way. While more and more airlines have switched to include the departure tax, the line can still be huge and at some points of the day it's poorly staffed. Upon arrivals, there is a critical rush hour at noon where several flights from the US, Mexico and Central America arrive at the same time, causing immigration lines up to 2 hours. Other than that, immigration is usually quick and baggage claim is very efficient (around 5-10 minutes). Customs clearance is also very quick. The other topic is the criminal price of the food inside the terminal. Costa Rica is an expensive country, but it goes to cringe worthy levels where you pay $6 for one Cinnabon roll (you pay $3 in CLT), $11-$15 for a burger with fries and refreshment. You seriously need to come with some food in your stomach (especially if you fly in the early morning flights). Another uncomfortable point is that there is no arrivals hall per se, and once you cross customs you'll be literally thrown to the street.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-09-08,8,10,"""gotten much better over the years""",Roy Arauz,"Juan Santamaría International Airport has gotten much better over the years. Clean and modern. The arrival process - customs and immigration - are as smooth as they can be. Departures are easy too, they could do better with the Exit Tax process - long lines and no where to fill out the forms (I understand some airlines will start allowing you to pay in advance which is excellent.) The food inside the terminal is ridiculously expensive - I paid $9.50 for a fast food breakfast sandwich. I still don't understand why they have to check each carry-on bag again at the gate when we were just screened and x-rayed going through security. It just slows the boarding process down.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-05-13,7,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Helen Devries,Check in and security very fast and efficient but then you hit the overpriced shops and the limited and expensive catering options. They should let the cafe outside arrivals take over a spot inside they offer decent food at good prices. The place is clean the staff are pleasant and helpful but it doesn't make up for the over priced shops and the limited choice of food.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2012-08-24,7,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Rob Brook,Used this airport several times over the past decade at various times of the day and on long and short haul flights. A small pleasant airport where it is usually possible to find a quiet corner. Staff are helpful and usually smile. 'Dining' is American fast food variety and expensive. Pay the $26 departure tax in advance at your hotel. Avoid the post-security shopping as the prices are high.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2012-05-01,7,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Carlos Moreira,Airport was quite easy to navigate. Exit tax is still $26 +$2 (fee for them to check your bags). I used my credit card and it goes through as a cash advance. There is no longer a smoking lounge if you want to smoke you need to do it outside before you even enter the airport. As for restaurants I hardly saw anything in the main terminal.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-02-20,8,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Sean Symon,Not a bad airport. Flew out of Terminal A with American Airlines. I thought Terminal B was nicer than Terminal A. Plenty of places to eat and view the runway. My only complaint was the longish wait at security. Other than that San Jose is a very functional airport.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-04-16,3,10,San Jose Airport customer review,K Heady,I was horrified to discover that the restaurants consist only of U.S. fast food. Other than coffee and I am thankful to Cafe Britt for that there is not a morsel of Costa Rican food available in the airport unless you include the Burger King typical breakfast. Not only that the food is poor quality and more expensive than it would be in the States. $29 for two small sandwiches a bowl of soup and two soft drinks is outrageous. There are several Costa Rican food chains that would be better quality and give a much better impression of the country.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2011-03-07,5,10,San Jose Airport customer review,R Thomas,Small modern clean airport with very efficient check-in and thorough friendly security lines. Decent tourist/souvenir shop post security as well. Great views of runways and adjacent mountains whilst waiting for flight.

2010-12-14,4,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Dana Sundmark,It was well organized and fairly painless to get through. The one thing to avoid when you arrive is the official money changing desk before you leave the terminal. It is a rip-off giving 10% less then everywhere else for USD. Taxis all take USD as well as colones.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-07-20,5,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Francisco Alves,The new Terminal B has finally opened. The new terminal is very high tech: chairs have internet connections; all-new local restaurants and shops throughout. Security is a breeze. Only one complaint: it is a long walk from security to boarding gates so bring good shoes.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-07-11,3,10,San Jose Airport customer review,A Schneider,When one leaves Costa Rica there is a $26 airport charge. If one pays by credit card the Costa Rican government puts the charge in as a cash advance fee. When your credit card bank gets that charge they then charge you a minimum cash advanced fee of $10. Don't use your credit card to pay for the exit tax. It'll then cost you $36 to leave Costa Rica.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2010-03-28,3,10,San Jose Airport customer review,B Scott,Be aware - after security there is no place to change money. If you have more leftover colones than you want to spend (which can be challenging to figure out since ALL prices after security are in dollars) you have to hope that you can get change from colones in dollars as a helpful person at Church's fried chicken did for me. There is also no bar after security making spending colones more of a challenge. Well there is a bar but it is in the smoking lounge which is in the basement and is unair conditioned so unless you are a smoker who likes to sweat it's not really an option. All food options in the terminal are American. It's clean and spacious (except for the construction area) and the farther you are from the construction area the better the A/C works. Some gates require a bus ride. Check-in seemed chaotic but was faster if you had done e-check-in with TACA. The security area was cramped due to construction but it moved quickly. As of 3/20/10 you can pay the departure tax in colones or dollars - if you use a credit card it is treated as a cash advance so be careful. You have to pay the departure tax before you check in - your migration form is on the back of the receipt and you need to fill that out before you check in. I liked the airport when I arrived (although I couldn't find an ATM on the arrivals level - you may have to go upstairs) but much less impressed on departure.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2010-01-14,2,10,San Jose Airport customer review,E Mabley,Terminal A (Southwest Airlines): The dingy dark and narrow corridors cause a serious overcrowding problem during peak flight times. The food options are overpriced and of poor quality. The airport is difficult to get to and requires navigation through downtown San Jose's horrible freeway system. The rental car kiosk is offsite and requires a long shuttle ride to get to/from the terminals. The only positive about this airport is that it's only 2 miles from downtown San Jose. The terminals are too small outdated and in dire need of re- design.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-12-13,1,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Kent Peterson,The airports decision to move United to Terminal A was very poorly planned. Making customers aware that this happened was non-existent as far as I could see. I just flew out and back on United at Terminal C just last week and I didn’t even know that this was going to happen. I dropped off passengers at Terminal C they were passed through security and only found out that United Moved to terminal A by the time they couldn’t see any United Gates. They even commented to the TSA representative that it seemed pretty quite there and the response was “oh yea Continental moved to Terminal A”. This was after they scanned their United Boarding Passes. Why did TSA allow passengers into a terminal that doesn’t support that airline? They checked the boarding pass but I now wonder why? I am VERY alarmed that any boarding pass valid or otherwise will allow anyone to enter a terminal. This seems to me to be a VERY large security issue. I would think that very simply the TSA agent would have a boarding pass scanner to verify that the boarding pass is valid and then verify ID. There are very few to none inter-terminal busses. I would have thought that they would try some very simple measures to assist your customers such as posting someone at the entrance to security warning of this change assuring inter-terminal busses to help customers who have no idea that they have changed the airport around. I took the Terminal C cut-off and I do not recall seeing any signs warning of the change. My passengers all missed their flights due to the fact that the switch to terminal A was poorly communicated there were no busses to get them to Terminal A and security lines were excessive. They now have to make other flight plans possibly at another airport.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-11-11,4,10,San Jose Airport customer review,J Dowden,For a smaller airport we found it very efficient. One thing we enjoyed was a smoking lounge AFTER you go through Security. Great place to kill a little time. The server there will go to the food court for you and get you a sandwich. Lounge itself serves cold drinks and coffee. As smokers it's getting harder and harder to find a place to smoke. This seems a great idea to me. Wish all airports had one.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-03-02,3,10,San Jose Airport customer review,J Ash,I travel to Costa Rica once or twice a year for over 18 years and they do not let you bring on beverages post initial security as they check your carry on manually in the jetway for liquids. I think they need to allow passengers to purchase an additional water to take on as most flights I am on are 5 hours. Otherwise just a small average airport.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-03-02,3,10,San Jose Airport customer review,Michelle Wright,Do not pay the airport exit tax with a credit card! hen I got my credit card statement from Capital One I had a $5 transaction fee for paying the airport tax. Plus I had interest accruing from it. The airport tax payment was considered a cash advance not a purchase. I was surprised. I paid the airport tax in Argentina with my Visa from U.S. Bank and the transaction was not considered as a cash advance.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-12-07,3,10,San Jose Airport customer review,M Desjardins,Just a tip re: the 26$ USD exit tax. It may be paid in advance at most hotels. With that in hand you can skip the main line and get to check-in a lot faster. The airport is suffering majorly from increased tourism and business travellers. Hopefully the new gates they are adding/repairing will help alleviate the wait times. Our flight out (Dec 1 2007) on Air Canada (AC999) was delayed by various (given) reasons: not enough busses to get you to your plane not enough security to escort you to your plane too many planes etc. My best advice is don't get too worked up like some passengers I saw relax and enjoy your final few moments in beautiful Costa Rica.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
