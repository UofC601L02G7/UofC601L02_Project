In the arrival concourse is a staffed information booth, a shop (closed when I arrived at night) and rental car booths. Taxis waited outside, I called a Uber. Departure was likewise very easy. I printed out my boarding passes from a machine. The shop (gifts, snacks, and reading materials) was open - University of Notre Dame paraphernalia was noticeable. TSA security check was unhurried and polite. After security, there are a couple of good places to eat and drink. The bathrooms were clean. The concourse was airy with high ceiling and glass panes that allowed you to watch tarmac and runway activity. The airport is about a 15 minute drive from downtown South Bend.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
