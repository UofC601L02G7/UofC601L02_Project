2019-06-24,5,10,"""there's not many staff""",C Merrell,"âœ… Trip Verified | I showed up to MLU for my morning flight. I was there in plenty of time and I have flown out of Monroe multiple times. A family in front of me was buying tickets for a flight tomorrow. I waited and waited. Apparently, the woman at the counter, (the only one working) thought I was with the family. Once she realized I wasn't with the family, she tried to get someone to help me but no one was there. I waited long enough to miss the time to check a bag. Finally, a man came to help, but immediately gave me a spill about being on time so I can check my bag next time. I was polite, but I've done this many times. Let's just say the woman working was not happy with him. She tried to help me and I don't think it was her fault that no one was there to help her. I had to wait from 9:40-4:30 to catch the next flight. I guess it is a small airport, so there's not many staff. I think the problem could be prevented.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
