Top notch tiny regional airport!",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-05-16,9,10,"""one of the most efficient""",Andrew Champagne,I fly into and out of Albany a few times a year on business. For my money it's one of the most efficient airports in terms of security/TSA in the country. They get you in out and on your way with very little hassle the way it should be. The airport itself isn't huge and doesn't have some of the amenities of a larger hub but as a traveller I'm looking for efficiency and that's what Albany Airport provides.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-03-21,5,10,"""big windows everywhere""",R Lipera,"This is my home airport so I fly in and out regularly. Recent renovations to the central area make it even nicer. Fully carpeted soothing music big windows everywhere. There is an observation deck open to the public on the ""non-security"" side that has good views. This is an easy airport in which to get around.",,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-08-09,5,10,"""a relatively small airport""",I Abodunrin,It's a relatively small airport. I agree with the earlier post about it's speediness. One of my friends once arrive less than half an hour before his flight departed and was still able to fly out (though I wouldn't recommend trying this). Overall a very good airport.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
