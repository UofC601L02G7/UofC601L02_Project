2024-09-03,1,10,"""been so strict for no reason""",L Bowen,"Not Verified |  Their security people and policies are out of control! They have been so strict for no reason. I am a pre-check customer and they found sea salt scrub in my carry on and took me aside to test it. I made it and I could have and offered to eat it. They told me no and then proceeded to take all of my belongings that I had already picked up including my purse, my shoes and cell phone. I find this practice illegal and highly invasive. I had done nothing wrong and because you're incompetent staff was not able to read an explosive test properly (had to call someone to walk him through it), then they inconvenienced me by taking my things and treating me inhumane. For my next flight, I'm driving to Denver. It's cheaper too even with having to pay for parking. Also, when you randomly select people to test their shoes through pre-check, that practice sucks too! You are inconveniencing people that paid to go through security without being harassed.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2024-02-20,3,10,"""TSA acts worse and worse""",Z Russ,"Not Verified | I have been flying in and out of COS for years, and over the years the TSA acts worse and worse, they act rude and no common courtesy what’s so ever. They stand there saying next, let’s go, hurry up, dont move this or that, you get scanned and they either say move, or I need to touch you more, and then still no kindness at all. They act like they have so much authority. I’ve had senior military leaders who speak better to people. They don’t deserve this position. Hire contractors who know how to speak to people professionally. TSA leadership needs to watch these people. Start treating people with a little respect!",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'February 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2023-04-03,4,10,"""Rudest security staff""",B Martin,Not Verified |  Rudest security staff I’ve ever experienced in years a of travel all over the world. No amenities open to accommodate first flights of the day.

2017-12-01,10,10,"""efficient and pleasant""",William Swain,"❎ Not Verified | I have flown into and out of the Colorado Springs twice a year since 2009. Each time, check in has been efficient and pleasant, the TSA agents have been very nice and observant, the airport has been clean and refreshment options have been pretty good. I was last there in October of 2017 and liked the fact that the piped in music in the waiting area was classic rock. I have a high opinion of the COS airport and don't mind at all flying in and out of it.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-01-09,9,10,"""no great distances to walk""",Scott Franks,"Great airport to travel from and return to. No great distances to walk, easy access to check in counters, TSA actually seems to care and think rather than defaulting to lowest level of acceptable service (ie - Denver). Early morning flights are great as the food court has great breakfast burritos and coffee. The only problem seems to be the luggage getting from the plane back to you. Once you have your bags, the rest of the trip out is a breeze.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-02-20,9,10,Colorado Springs Airport customer review,Billy Swain,I have used COS airport several times flying from Nashville to COS and back to Nashville. Each time I have been there airport personnel have been very helpful and friendly TSA security officials have been efficient and very observant and the airport has always been clean. I would highly recommend this airport to other fliers.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2009-09-14,2,10,Colorado Springs Airport customer review,G Irwin,The lack of reasonably priced and convenient public transportation options to and from the airport is a major downside to this otherwise attractive airport. Why the city bus system stops just short of the airport is hard to understand without invoking a conspiracy theory involving the expensive and inconvenient commercial bus taxi and limousine services that enjoy a monopoly in this market.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}

2009-04-27,3,10,Colorado Springs Airport customer review,J Khosla,I highly recommend traveling out of COS if you live in Pueblo Colorado Springs even Denver! COS is a very cozy and convenient airport with easy parking check-in security and baggage claim. It's main terminal has 12 gates so it isn't at all huge but it is a very comfortable size. In the past several years the planes flying into and out of COS have sadly gotten smaller (think regional jets) and the routes served are mostly to hub cities. That said I would personally rather fly out of COS and connect than drive the extra hour and a half to DEN and fly nonstop because it is a lot less stressful. The airport recently purchased new furniture for each gate area and it is a vast improvement. They even have padded benchs in the center of the terminal that you can lie on and sleep before you fly! This little extra is great because let's face it when people come from sea level to 6187 ft it is nice to lie down and adjust to the high altitude. That said one downfall of COS is its lack of shops and restaurants though the variety isn't horrible. The free Wi-Fi throughout the terminal though helps compensate for this shortfall.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-08-27,3,10,Colorado Springs Airport customer review,Jim Wood,If you don't need to go to Denver I recommend COS as the best option for going to Colorado. Small but not too small; clean efficient quick and centrally located to most points in Colorado. Good quick car rentals. I use it routinely to go to Pueblo and Denver. Yes Denver as it can be more convenient and faster to get to a lot of places especially in south Denver. Remember Denver airport is 30 miles east and an expensive toll road from many points in Denver. Also traffic is very congested in Denver but only moderately so in Colorado Springs. Only problem I have is that most often (but not always) the cheaper fares are into and out of Denver.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2006-10-11,3,10,Colorado Springs Airport customer review,Coinneach Fitzpatrick,I fly through COS whenever possible even though I live in downtown Denver. Very nice clean simple airport. If you're flying on United the walk to the gates at the far end (the entire terminal is half the size of DIA's Concourse A) takes about 10 minutes). Security is quick and painless parking is plentiful and cheap and the concessions are good. The only problem I've ever had at COS is nothing to do with the airport itself; Colorado Springs is doing major work on I-25 and getting through the city to the airport can be tiresome.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2005-11-30,2,10,Colorado Springs Airport customer review,Alex Porter,COS is a nice airport and very efficient. Restaurants are good for a smaller airport and baggage claim wait was short. I really appreciated the free wi-fi internet service something that is often paid for in other airports. The only drawbacks are that it is far from the city so cab fares are high (plus the city bus system doesn't include the airport) and the terminal is so tiny compared to the airport as a whole that it takes a long time to taxi to the runway even with light traffic.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2005-11-23,3,10,Colorado Springs Airport customer review,Eleanor McAleer,This is a small airport so you will never get lost. I go there twice a year and have never been held up going through security for more than five minutes. The staff have always been very helpful. For such a small airport there are a few decent places to eat. I used to fly into Denver and drive to the Springs but never again.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
