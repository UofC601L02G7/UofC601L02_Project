2017-09-02,7,10,"""does what it's supposed to""",G Wilson,"❎ Unverified | Hilo Airport does the job. Large area of unused terminal, but the part we used was OK. Travelled with carry-on only, so can't comment on baggage. Went in and out with no fuss, (TSA pre-approved). Not much in the way of shopping, but not many people about to shop. Sat and had a qiuet drink whilst waiting for our flight, no rush. It's a bit outdated, but as I said, does what it's supposed to.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-05-18,1,10,"""uncomfortable, smelly, and unclean""",Z Charles,"It's been a few years since this airport has been reviewed, so here's an update. There is no cell-phone waiting area when you're picking up passengers and the security people are very quick to ask you to move. The last time I picked up a friend, I stopped to call him to tell him I was there (using a phone while driving is a ticketable offense in Hawaii), and the security woman would not stop talking in my window at me to move while I made the quick call. There was almost zero traffic at this time so I was not impeding others from loading/unloading. The TSA security is unprofessional to a level I've not seen at any other airport I've been to. I have heard them conversing loudly about the contents of passenger's bags on numerous occasions. The decor is extremely dated and the seats are very uncomfortable, and of course there are very limited outlets. There is a bar, but I would not visit it. The airport in general is uncomfortable, smelly, and unclean. People keep reviewing it as having short wait times, but I don't think that's right considering the small amount of traffic at this airport.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
