2024-07-03,1,10,"""does not have air conditioning""",Linda Kovalick,Not Verified |   This place does not have air conditioning. So if you're delayed you will wait in extreme heat. I just spent 5 hours there. I'm in shock that no one was hauled away on a stretcher from heat exhaustion because it was dangerously hot in there. While we waited in our sweatbox inside our checked luggage that we had to carry thru TSA ourselves sat outside in the hot sun. Don't be fooled by thinking the US Virgin Islands are related to the US somehow and the airport will follow suit. That airport is like any other 3rd world country airport. Awful.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-07-19,1,10,"""so many people missed their flights because of the ridiculous line""",M Dee ,"Not Verified |  If I could give this airport zero stars, I would. The worst airport I have ever been to in my entire life. Our flight was delayed twice just like other airlines as well because for some odd reason the customs line was backed all the way out of the airport past Spirit’s outside check in. It was horrendous. The delayed flight didn’t really bother me because everyone was in the same boat. We arrived 3 hours and 20 minutes early and we literally needed all of that time. They said they were going to hold flights, but so many people missed their flights because of the ridiculous line. They made the process so confusing. If they had signs and warm and welcoming people in the front, it’ll be smooth-going. You’re literally scared to ask a question because they might bite your head off. It’s like, they have an attitude and make you feel dumb as if we are supposed to already know. People are asking questions because we’re all confused. Between customs and TSA, those were the rudest people I have ever met in my life. They were so mean and nasty to people. I felt so bad for the people they ridiculed and embarrassed in front of everyone. We met a guy in line that went through the 2 hour line before us, he went outside to get fresh air because it was so hot in the airport, and guess what? They literally made him go through the entire 2+ hour process all over again. Wow! I would’ve cried. When you’re coming into the island, it’s all welcoming and they have music playing, but when you’re leaving, it’s like the slums and feels so gloomy, dark, and depressing. The airport is already undeveloped, hot, and outdated, but can you imagine spending all this money during your vacation on this expensive island then, get treated like crap when we’re leaving? That was absolutely heartbreaking. I didn’t expect top notch service because a vast majority of people we met were not very nice outside of the airport, just on the island itself, but overall, I’ve never been so ready to get on a plane in my life. I will not recommend this vacation spot to anyone honestly. I’m glad I went and saw the beauty of the island especially the beaches, but the treatment these people give you, is just horrible. It makes you not want to visit there. Unfortunately, the mean people outweigh the nice ones. I’m good. I’m glad I went, but never again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-05-04,3,10,"""the worst Airport I ever been to""",Jachael Nichols,"Not Verified |  This is the worst Airport I ever been to, and to tell you truth, it would be helpful if they gave people more jobs to make this environment less stressful. It took 3 and a half hour to get through TSA. So makes sure if your flying out of St Thomas to arrive 4hrs before your flight because they will leave you. A lot of people were rude that works there, especially TSA, I now know what it's like to be treated like an immigrant. I pray their whole process gets better.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-07-03,1,10,"""absolute amateur hour""",R Leicht,"Not Verified | This is the worst, nastiest, pathetic airport I have ever visited. It's absolute amateur hour and all is designed for the convenience of the workers - nothing for the actual passengers. No air conditioning! You must lug your own bag, that you've just checked, through security and then put it on the belt yourself, while some employee just stands there. Insane. Many of the employees can barely hide their disdain for the tourists. Half the ceiling tiles are missing, shops still boarded up a year after the hurricane. And the airport was awful long before the hurricane.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-04-22,4,10,"""Food extremely overpriced""",Peter Helton,✅ Trip Verified |  Food in the airport was extremely overpriced. Even though the area had recently went through a hurricane the lack of interest in making repairs or working on repairing the airport was not present. The areas that were damaged were simply covered over with plastic.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-11-06,1,10,"""ugly and deteriorating airport""",Michelle Grimes,"Cyril E. King Airport in St Thomas is a dirty, ugly and deteriorating airport! What a way to welcome people to the Virgin Islands. Did you look around? No wonder the welcome girls hand you rum when you pick up your bags, they're trying to blur your vision. I've never seen so many employees doing nothing - someone hand them a paint brush.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
