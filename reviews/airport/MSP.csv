2024-08-25,2,10,“Shame on the management”,Judith Mohay ,"✅ Trip Verified | Our Amsterdam flight arrived at time precisely. 1.5 hours wait on the tarmac because of the gate agent, because of other reasons. In the international arrival hall > 500 people, 3 officers to check passports, > 2 hours waiting. In civilized countries, usually helpers are asking passengers about tight connections and help them through to catch their flights. The assistants here were few and could not care less about us. The luggage’s checked in and out for customs - the re- check points with other assistants (watching their phones) directing passengers how to put their luggage on the right position - not helping or moving a finger in the process. Security - same rude treatment: we supposed to push our bags through the tunnel - at the flashing red light - who would know? workers standing there and screaming at us, not helping at all. I had to run like crazy to catch my flight and I would have never be able to do it without the help of a kind fellow passenger. Shame on the management to allow this to happen. “Welcome to the USA “ was written on monitors. It was a mess and a far cry from anything welcoming. I will try never to go through that airport again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Then at the Arrivals/Baggage Claim the cars are double, triple parked and will sit there for 20, 30, 40 minutes blocking traffic and making it impossible to load your car. We saw some cars just sitting there for over an hour while our man went to get our rental car. Security is non-existant, we never saw a guard until some dude threatened us while we were trying to back our car in to load, then one slow-witted airport security dude shows up, and basically does nothing because ""that's always how it is here...and I'm supposed to be on my break."" Eventually four real police arrived to deal with a situation that never should have happened in the first place. Try double parking at LAX Arrivals for longer than three minutes and see what happens. Stop letting people quadruple park at Arrivals before someone gets violent, because it will happen eventually if it hasn't yet.

I witnessed an extremely elderly couple arrive at the TSA que. They were traveling alone and obviously had trouble getting around. They did not have the correct boarding documents, but instead of showing compassion, or helpfulness, the airport employee yelled at them and told them to get out of line & go back to the ticketing counter. The elderly woman asked if her husband could wait there ( he had a very hard time walking) but the grouchy employee said,” No, you have to take him with you! I don’t have anywhere to stash him!” Like he was a piece of luggage or something. Next she ordered me & my family to a TSA booth that didn’t have an agent manning it. We stood there briefly, looking to see if an agent was coming. Next we stepped to the next agent to show our ID & boarding passes. She charged over to us and told us to stay where she put us!

Having traveled extensively in my 59 years, I have to say that MSP is one of the most ill-designed and unfriendly airports in the world. Yesterday I walked 2+ miles to my connection, the moving walkways not operating. Every single time I’ve flown to/from/thru MSP in the past 30 years there has been an issue. Entering the States from Europe several times we were detained in security for 3 or more hours, our kids taken to the other side of the room while we were interrogated. Never has this happened at any other airport in the world on our travels. Last time we waited for 20 minutes for a French translator to come to read the label on a can of foie gras to determine if it contained pork.  You need to do better MSP!

Getting from the outer C Concourse to the main terminal is not intuitive (there is a train I would have missed if not for the help of a local). Directions to Light Rail are not entirely intuitive and the airport maps online are absolutely useless for figuring out how to get from the Light Rail to the gates. The food selection is ok but not what I would expect at a hub airport. Ditto the shopping. Security was quick with little wait in the TSA or regular lines. I used Delta, which is the dominant carrier here. The service was okay. The thing with Delta is that they are pretty inept at their home base in Atlanta, but often better elsewhere, The most remarkable thing here was that one person managed the gate ---this may be a legacy of Northwest (which Delta acquired). Delta's legacy facilities usually have two people at the gate with one often more inept than the other (DCA and ATL).

Finally we were told to find a manager where about 5 people were standing at a podium. There was a lady there with red hair visiting that came to help us. It then took another 15 more minutes to get mom passed through security. We missed our pre-board time and were told at the gate that she should have pre-boarded. Well no kidding.

We were last in the line and the line was not moving. I saw everyone else from our plane were on the other line and were already checked out and got their luggage and we were still standing at the end of the line with about 40 people in front of us. When I asked one of the Delta agents and told her there must be some kind of a mistake cause we’ve been waiting for more than an hour and everyone else from our flight is on the other line she told me it’s because my husband has a foreign passport and because it has an x written on it so we have to stay in that line. I told her we’re family of 4 and my 2 kids and i have us passports but she said we have to stay in that line and wait. I was so upset because of the long wait, I was sick, and the fact we had to drive back home to Fargo which is 4 hours away from Minneapolis but no one seemed to care even when I physically walked over to the security guard and told him about our situation he told me rudely to go back to my family and wait. When everyone finally left and we came to check out the agent was so rude to me and told me to complain to his boss who was by the way a nice gentleman and when i explained to him that we live in States and my two kids and I have passports and my husband has his Bosnian passport and a green card he then asked if we have shown the Delta agent his green card. I said we didn’t because we were never asked for it. He then said that Delta agent should’ve sent us to the faster line because my husband had sufficient docs. He aldo said that I can complain to Delta supervisor at the front with the red suit on.

We flew out of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport yesterday morning. We had a 6:50 am flight and arrived to return our rental car at 5:20. When we entered Terminal 1 we were shocked to see the security lines running both directions down the center of the terminal. One line had even doubled back on itself. I have never seen such long lines at any airport! (I hope it was due to bad weather the past few days and the need to reschedule people who missed flights but the security line would have taken at least 1 1/2 hours to get through) My husband and I have pre-check but my elderly parents ( early to late 80's) did not so he went through to our gate to make sure he could catch the flight for work while I stayed in the security line to help them. The line was moving very slowly and I became concerned that we might be in the wrong line. I asked a security officer near me if indeed I was headed in the right direction and expressed my concern that we would miss our flight. He said I was in the correct line and asked if I possibly had pre-check. I explained that I did but my parents didn't and that I needed to stay to help them through security and on the flight. He kindly had us follow him to another line where we were able to get through security as our flight was continuing the boarding process. We were able to grab a courtesy cart, as our gate was a long walk from the security checkpoint. We arrived at our gate just as boarding was finishing.

I love this terminal, it is simple, easy and although it does not have the space of Terminal 1 or all of the amenities, it is a breeze. At MSP, Terminal 2 was added as an expansion and it has since been expanded to 14 gates and it is essentially a large hallway with very simple parking and a few restaurants. The terminal is small but that is also it's best appeal, it is so easy to navigate and spend time in. I have been through domestic and international departures and arrivals and it has just been easy, the way it should be. Parking is simple, one of two ramps, Orange or Purple, park your vehicle, walk across the skyway and you are in. If you are on the side with security open, you just walk into security if you do not need to check a bag and you already have your ticket. Once you are through security, find your gate (not that hard, there are only 14 of them) and go get something to eat. The food is good and mostly local to Minneapolis but be aware that the airport's amenities do not open until 5am, the restaurants open later than that. I ran into this problem with an early Sun Country flight to Cancun. Arrival is pretty much just as easy, you'll be in the airport just long enough to get your bags and a cup of coffee and then walk across the skyway and get in your car. Sun Country and Southwest are the primary carriers out of Terminal 2 and there are a few others as well.

My husband was traveling with his service dog and was one of the passengers redirected to the other security line. The staff member tried to close the opening for redirected passengers behind my husband and in front of me. I said, ""Wait, that's my husband with the service dog that you just redirected."" She replied (with a condescending tone), ""Well then you better go keep up with him."" After waiting in line just as long at the North Checkpoint, the TSA staff checked my husband's ticket and license and sent him through to the metal detector staff. Then, a passenger in a wheelchair appeared in the lane next to me. The TSA staff in front of me indicated that I should wait while the first person in the wheelchair lane was serviced. I waited. After that wheelchair passenger was through, another one came up in the lane next to me. The TSA staff waved that wheelchair passenger to come forward. Then, the TSA staff asked the person standing behind that wheelchair passenger if they were together. This person responded, ""Yes"" and also went forward. I finally walked up to the TSA staff. When he indicated that I should have waited for his signal to walk up, I said, ""My husband is the man with the service dog who is already all the way through security and waiting on the other side. I'm not waiting any longer."" I got a dirty look from both him and the next wheelchair passenger in the other lane. I was absolutely appalled at the attitude and disregard for courtesy that these TSA agents had for it's Minneapolis passengers.

As I exited my gate I entered directly into a restaurant which is very disorienting and seems to be their design strategy now. Many of the gates are not just gates with waiting areas rather restaurants shops and other facilities. When departing the gate area for the international flights around gate G4 were packed with people and rather claustrophobic and there was nowhere to sit unless you wanted to be in one of the restaurants. This particular day the outside temperatures were close to 100 F and it was hot in the terminal. Also the distance between gates can be quite far.

I fly into the Twin Cities about 4 times a year to go north. I get out easily enough but coming back into the city is almost always a nightmare; even with GPS. Every major city I know has airport signage about 15 or 20 miles out of the city - giving you both directions and some peace of mind that you are on the right track. The only airport sign I ever find in MSP is about a mile from the airport - while we're busy doing detours. Last week I was driven to the airport from the Range and we were following GPS. We gave ourselves an extra hour. Missed the flight partially because of very nice but insanely thorough security guards who made my daughter-in-law open all of her baby food confiscated the ice pack in her cold container for the baby's milk and basically held up everyone for about an extra 20 minutes.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-05-09,2,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,J Roberts,"I would love to tell you about my experience in the airport but we never got to see it. We arrived from overseas with 2 hours + to make our connecting domestic flight. We spent the entire time waiting in the passport control line where 4 officers one by one checked the entry documents for over 400 people from varying airlines. And we were in the ""US passport holders"" line! We finally cleared passport control then customs and ran across the airport only to miss our flight by five minutes. What I can't believe is why they seemed so overwhelmed with the number of passengers. It's not like these planes are showing up without notice or anything. In my lone experience I would not enter the US or make connecting international flights through Minneapolis St. Paul until the US Border Patrol there changes their service.",,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 0, 'Airport Shopping': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2011-11-19,5,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,J Craven,Parking at Terminal 2 is unacceptable and poorly communicated. Arriving at Lindbergh only to find out you need to go nearly two miles away park take the escalator take the light rail take the tram just makes the hassle of air travel worse. The parking seems to be more about the convenience of maintenance for MSP than for the convenience of the traveler. Lots of holiday decorations and heaven knows lots of advertisements but give me moving walkways that work reasonable queues and most important - on-time departures and arrivals!,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2011-07-24,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,M Jackson,"I have been to MSP a couple of times and departing has never been a problem the service is very efficient and security has never been an issue. On arrival I was disappointed with how I was treated. I come to Minneapolis to visit a friend twice a year and stay for no more than 3 weeks. I was treated as if I intended to stay illegally and was made to feel guilty for something I had no intention of doing. I know these people are only doing their jobs but when I connected through Chicago I was never subjected to such interrogation. I was welcomed with a smile and a very friendly ""welcome to America"". I have to admit it puts me off wanting to fly direct to Minneapolis again.",,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-06-06,1,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Nick Engen,We arrived late for a connection flight. We had 20 minutes to get to the next gate all the way on the other side of the airport. I would recommend that you have more than 2 hours for connection time. The airport is messed up and very hard to get around. We never made it to our destination.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-02-16,1,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,John Doe,In a nutshell never take a connection flight to this airport without leaving at least 2 hours in between connections or else you will have to due a little workout in the airport just to get from one terminal to the other while looking at the watch and crossing fingers. And if you miss your flight you will have to beg Delta airlines to rebook you that's of course if you find someone in the terminal to rebook you. Just imagine a large gym with people sprinting all over and there you have it Minneapolis airport.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-02-02,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,G Kramer,I have been quite satisfied with my experiences at MSP. I must agree that some of the concourses (C especially) seem quite long but it never hurt anyone to walk a little bit (there are moving sidewalks for a good part of the C concourse anyway if walking isn't your thing). The signage within the airport is quite good and it is a very clean airport. Can't say much about the retail options as I've never understood shopping at airports. I feel the food options are rather good. Others have pointed out the fact that it can be a bit pricey to fly out of MSP but I have found there to be much fewer delays at MSP than at O'Hare. It's nice to have the non-stop options that Delta provides. The three daily non-stops to Amsterdam are wonderful for connecting to many cities in Europe.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-12-16,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,E Ferwerda,The size of MSP and the length of some concourses (especially G and C) are rightly (in)famous; there is however a little-known way for departing passengers to deal with this. There is a pedestrian bridge between Concourses G and C over the access road; the middle of this bridge can be accessed directly from the Red and Blue parking ramps. Security and check-in can be done here but baggage check cannot be. NOTE: Only Northwest/Delta passengers can check in here. It would be possible for arriving passengers to leave security here and then take the tram from the parking ramps to the main terminal to pick up baggage but whether this would be faster than walking the concourses I cannot say.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-10-13,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Neil Ramsay,Checked in around midday for a late afternoon NWA flight. No crowds fast simple kiosk check in and very helpful bag drop lady. Only one place to eat landside so decided to go thru security (quick easy and pleasant) and find a restaurant/fast food outlet. Plenty of places to eat and drink airside. It is a deceptively big airport and some gates involve a long walk. But there are plenty of moving footways and an electric cart pick up service at specific points around the concourses. Signage was clear departure info everywhere toilets clean plenty of empty gate lounges to 'get away' from the throng for a while. Some gates become quite crowded just before departures. Pleasant experience overall.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-04-17,3,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,D Wlaschin,"The airport is aesthetically beautiful but it is not set up for easy access to other concourses/gates and baggage this is especially true for those on small commuter planes that use the B and C concourses. After flying packed like sardines in planes not designed to accomodate anyone over 5'5"" and 150""s you then have to walk from what feels like downtown St. Paul to get to the main concourse. If you need to go to another concourse you are hopeful that you have the time or are phsyically able to do so. The main point of this is don't ever count on the Tram on Concourse C to be working. In the last 4 months the times I have flown which is often I have been able to use the tram 3 times. Landing yesterday 4-16-2009 at gate B 13 I found out that it will be down for at least 10 days to replace the cable sytem. Which is wonderful if it was well used and several years old but it is less than 5 years old I believe! Again if you are training for a marathon you will love the airport. If not be prepared to walk or if late run!",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-02-18,3,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,A Sharma,What makes MSP not bad is security always moves fast no matter how crowded. All the check in counters are within one roof and the concourse are connected which means no need to take any trams (although that option is still there if you dont want to walk a whole lot). It is spacious than most of the airport I have been to like Phoenix Vegas LAX etc. Shops are decent. Baggage are is not all that posh but not dirty either. You can pick up your bag without much hassel and be on your way. The best part is the ground transportation. You have light rail that you can take.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-10-31,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Kevin McDougald,Travelling from Canada to Europe via Minneapolis/St. Paul was less trouble than experienced. Outbound most Canadian passengers can take advantage of U.S. Customs and Immigration pre-clearance which is a fairly painless experience at smaller airports such as Winnipeg and go straight to their connecting flight on arrival. Clearing U.S. Customs and Immigration on the way back to Canada was a breeze at MSP thanks to short lineups and affable staff. There's a good selection of airside stores and restaurants too. Ubiquitous TVs tuned in to CNN are a mixed blessing: they just add to the din at a crowded gate but if you can find an empty gate you can stretch out relax and watch the news while waiting for your connecting flight.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-07-06,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Emmet Ferwerda,This has been my home airport for several years. Downsides: size (I suggest at least 60 minutes between flights) price (Northwest's fault not the airport) lack of airside transportation between terminals and not enough shops/food landside. Also the baggage claims are old and can easily back up (I heard recently that they will be replaced in the near future). Now for the good parts. Plenty of diverse reasonably priced shopping and food airside and clear signage throughout. The Customs/Immigration staff while not overly friendly were very professional and reasonably quick. Also I have never seen security or (Northwest) bag check lines longer than 10-15 minutes). There is an easy fast light-rail connection to/from downtown Minneapolis. There is also a separate underground tram from the parking ramps to the terminal eliminating the need to carry your bags outside. The entire facility is clean and well-lit. For those with a 2-3 hour layover there is a little-known observation tower in Concourse D (go to the block in the center of the concourse and all the way up the stairs) which is usually uncrowded and a very nice place to relax. Overall it can be large and expensive but it is otherwise redeemed by atmosphere and ease of use.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-07-04,2,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,K Wild,I had a connection flight through MSP to Mason City IA a city served with only three daily flights. Even though I had arrived some 15 minutes late inbound from Newark I still assumed I had enough time to make my connection flight. That was until MSP came into play. I had originally had approximately 45 minutes to connect flights and even with the 15 minute inbound delay it still left me (and my older aunt who was traveling with me) 30 minutes to go from one gate to the other. I took off in a rather fast-pace walking from one gate to another following the overhead signs to my connection terminal. Following the directional signs it took me nearly 20 minutes to walk between my two gates mind you walking at the pace of a 20-some year old sprinting at times once I kept looking at my watch. In the end I arrived at my connection-departure gate 5 minutes prior to departure the departure door had already been closed and I missed my connection flight. In a nutshell MSP is a much much too spread out airport which makes a connection of less than 90 minutes nearly impossible. As a result of this I will never be booking a flight that offers a connection though MSP again. I will happily pay extra to avoid this airport.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-04-15,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Beverley Pedersen,A clean and friendly airport with lots of shops for all your needs and plenty of seating area. Plenty of nearby gates for eating while you hang around. There is a family room here too for resting up where there are children travelling. If they had seating without arms that you could lay out on as they do at Gatwick they would warrant a 5 star. Distances between gates sometimes are extensive but there are carts floating around for your help too.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-02-25,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,L Hurst,After disembarking from my NWA flight it was so easy to find my way to the tram that would take me to my next terminal. Even though I had a 3 hour stop over I felt that there was plenty to keep me entertained especially when my flight to LAX was delayed 45 minutes. The shops were different and had variety - when I stopped in at a convenience store to get a magazine and a Coke lady at the checkout was personable and keen to converse beyond how much my purchases came to. The gate lounge was clean and seats were confortable. One thing that struck me as particularly odd though was the amount of dogs that were allowed to walk around on a lead with their owners. Never seen that before at an airport!,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-02-17,1,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,L Visser,I have traveled internationally for many years.

2007-11-12,1,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Sue Dahl,I have used Lindbergh terminal for several years and have always been impressed with it's ease of use and the shopping - I usually have a 7 hour layover and find plenty to do during that time. My last trip was less than memorable as I was flying Northwest from Minot ND to Minneapolis and Icelandair from Minneapolis to Glasgow. This time Icelandair had moved to Humphry terminal so I had to transfer from one terminal to the other. My impression is that Lindbergh and Humphry terminals have an ongoing war of some kind and really don't give a damn about their customers. There is no transfer for baggage so I had to drag my bags with me - on the outward journey I had to take a bus from just outside Lindbergh to just outside Humphry (signs and directions were practically non existant). On the return journey I found that after already traveling for 16 hours I had to drag my bags through the entire parking garage to reach the mass transit train this took me about 20 minutes. I am a person who is not easily scared by anything but I have never felt so unsafe walking through the parking garage on my own at 7:00 pm - no airport staff or security anywhere in sight I really wondered where on earth I was going and if I was going in the right direction. Once I got on the train (absolutely exhausted) I found that there were a couple of young men about 20 feet away from me starting a fight! What a wonderful impression this gives to any travellers coming to this country for the first time. Unfortunately I have very few choices of transport between North Dakota and Scotland and will probably have to take the same route again (I usually make two trips a year). Minneapolis needs to have a dedicated means of transport for airline passengers between the two terminals and more security. I would add that I am 64 years old and in reasonable shape when I finally reached Lindbergh terminal I was absolutely exhausted frustrated and upset by the whole experience I still had another 7 hours travel time before I would be home. I am writing letters to everyone I can think of regarding this incident I would encourage anyone else who has had the same experience to do the same.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-10-16,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,S De Penning,Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport seems optimum in the sense that it is large enough to offer passengers multiple shopping and dining venues and yet it still maintains a very clean and modern environment despite its size - something I have to appreciate after having been to more rustic monstrosities such as Chicago O'Hare. It is true that Northwest Airlines dominates the airport and its passengers may have to walk long distances to and from its many dispersed concourses but this actually seems to translate into an advantage for passengers flying other airlines because most of them seem to have their operations concentrated on one concourse that is quite close to check-in baggage claim and the Northstar Crossing dining/shopping. So if you are traveling say American Continental Delta etc. you may not even realize the immense size of the airport because you are not likely to contend with it. My one complaint about MSP is that there are very few shops and restaurants open during the early hours of the morning which is an inconvenience for persons such as myself who normally arrive at the terminal quite early for flights departing at 6 or 7 a.m. with international connections and would like to eat or shop before boarding. However in all fairness I doubt that many airports have much to offer at that hour.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-09-26,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Jane Tuckett,There is a good mix of shops and eating places but most important of all the signeage is clear.We were coming in from Europe and needing to catch another flight connection after clearing customs. I was SO pleased that after we'd done that there was a sign indicating where the luggage needed to go for onward flights. Last year we went through Dulles and we hadn't a clue where the bags had to go and the staff didn't help. One sign at MSP saved an awful lot of upset and resulting delayed baggage that we had at Dulles. Give me MSP anyday.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-08-14,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Jim Wood,"I use MSP 5-6 times a year and find it ""serviceable"". Its too big and distances between connections can be long and tiring even with the escalators and trams. Food tends to be mediocre and expensive and in general I find the whole MSP experience dispiriting. One good thing: the NWA lounges are top- notch or very close to it. Also you can pay a daily fee and get in. Very worthwhile if you have a 5-6 hour (or more) layover. International arrival there is OK no long delays but customs takes themselves very seriously and seems to operate on the premise if they're not inspecting someone's bags they're not doing their jobs. You can get to the Mall of America pretty easily if you do find yourself with a 6 hour layover. At least you could before I-45 collapsed.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-06-05,4,10,Minneapolis St Paul Airport customer review,Robert Dunford,One of the nicest US airports I've visited which made an enforced further 24 hour stay that much more bearable. Nicely spaced out nothing is too far away and even getting to/from Downtown Minneapolis and the MoA is a lot easier than (say) Heathrow. If you fly NW and use hotel drop-off the self check-in where you're dropped off makes things less hassle. Only minor quibble was that if you have a lot of people queuing up for a non NW flight (in my case UAL) it gets crowded. But then it was the time when my own flight got delayed so it was probably a bad day.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
