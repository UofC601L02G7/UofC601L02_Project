2023-11-01,1,10,"""Shuttle service for rental cars is getting worse""",M Johnson,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Shuttle service for rental cars is getting worse and worse by the day. I have been traveling weekly to SMF and I can say the shuttle service has gotten worse by the day in the last six months. It used be couple of minutes wait to now it is over 20 minutes of wait with 100s of passengers waiting in shuttle line. At this point, I am seriously not renting car from the airport and just catch Uber ride to downtown rental agencies and it would be cheaper and faster.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2023-06-02,3,10,"""Worst shuttle service ever""",Patricia Thornton,Not Verified |  Plan on waiting 50 minutes for the rental car shuttle from terminal B or use airlines that fly out of terminal A. Worst shuttle service ever out of Terminal B. Tons of business travelers needing to get to rental cars and the wait is inconsiderate to those of us who use the airport for work.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2023-05-03,4,10,"""worst airport to arrive with luggage""",R Cervino,✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airport to arrive with luggage. The airport is tiny and they managed to take more than an hour to start releasing our luggage. It is absolutely the worst airport in Northern California,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2022-02-05,4,10,"""Budget lots more time for this airport""",David Deaton,"Not Verified |  Budget lots more time for this airport, horribly inefficient. Taking the more difficult option of public transport (rental cars, etc.) is penalized by drop-off area furthest from each terminal. Rental car center requires dragging bags across lots, through building and then long wait on huge bus, only to be dropped off on outer land furthest from check-in! Maddening. If you miss turn-off to your terminal (no sign, only colors) be prepared for long delay as you drive miles to other terminal and terminal return. Why a smallish regional airport needs to be spread out over miles of terminal is difficult to comprehend. It’s one thing to have to significant transfer between terminals at London Heathrow (giant airport in urban area) it’s quite another at small regional. How about putting terminals together and allow passengers to access them without driving all over god’s green earth. Sorry for the rant but dragging heavy bags for 20 minutes at 5am needlessly requires some decompression.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-11-13,2,10,"""Worst airport in a decade""",K Davies,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport in a decade. The gas station on the drive in is great, but getting out was awful. No signs! And dark red Jersey barriers in the middle of the road impossible to see which is bad cause 3 of us were driving around trying to find an exit. No signs. Then one tiny sign across the road, no lighting to direct you to the airport. Can’t see in dark and fog. Drove the wrong way, it is a two mile trip to a dead end to get back to the airport. Signs to rental cars as bad. Can’t see in fog which is common this time of year. Another 2 mile misdirection. Rental rental requires a bus. Train to terminal B ok but just be warned. Marginal food choices. Coffee stand closed at 07.00! I have been in 3rd world countries with better quality. Take extra time. Be warned!",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2021-09-27,1,10,"""They are consistently rude and unnecessarily aggressive""",R Jackson,"Not Verified |  I’m writing after multiple negative experiences with Sacramento Airport’s traffic operations staff (SMF Operations). They are consistently rude and unnecessarily aggressive. I understand the importance of controlling traffic relative to departures and arrivals, however, it is unacceptable and unnecessary for these employees to be as rude and aggressive as they consistently are. I am wondering if these persons are hired with afore knowledge of their inability to perform their duties without any public service etiquette at all. I would rather travel to the South Bay Area to fly than to fly out of local Sac International in order to avoid having any encounters with these employees whatsoever. I do not appreciate being verbally assaulted by these employees and this is something that definitely should be addressed and changed.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'September 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2020-07-06,8,10,"""Easy to Navigate airport""",Eric Garmen,✅ Trip Verified |  Easy to Navigate airport with a simple layout. Not many restaurants/food places were open due to COVID.

Bus driver was singing and doing hand gestures, I felt unsafe. At airport security, TSA had a hundred people in line. Meanwhile 5 agents and a dog are standing around at the front of the line. The young agent ordering us through the xray took lessons on TV from a nazi program. Overall, a very trying time getting out of Sacramento.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'December 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-07-04,8,10,"""functional, clean and serviceable""",Eric Louis Russell,"My home airport, so I know it rather well. While not being a hub (or even a terribly important spoke) for any airline, it's quite practical and typically less stressful than other NorCal alternatives. The new terminal is nice, if a bit over-sized for itself, I'm a fan of the giant red rabbit (why not be different?), the old terminal is still quite functional, clean and serviceable. Decent selection of restaurants/coffee shops, etc. in both. A few words of caution for those who don't use the airport regularly: It's not far from the city, but it is in the middle of an empty field, so no hotels nearby, etc. If you have a very early flight, stay at a hotel and use Uber or equivalent - don't plan on staying at airport. Taxis are a total scam from SMF and usually take longer than needed: use Uber or similar, Blue vans are usually good if you have time to spare. TSA seems to be improving, but can still be a bit nightmarish, especially in the older terminal and on Monday mornings and Friday afternoons, or at holidays.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-01-15,10,10,Sacramento Airport customer review,T Beumer,I have been through this airport every month for over 2 years. This is the first time I have had someone raise their voice and tell me that I and all other employees are wrong. I simply requested to not go through the x- ray machine. Every where else directs me to where I am to stand and wait to be patted down and wand with a metal detector. Highly upsetting.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-08-14,7,10,Sacramento Airport customer review,S King,Once again landed at the old terminal (United) and departed from the new (Southwest). The older terminal is not bad but nothing special. Of course landing one does not deal with check-in counters restaurants etc. We again experienced the rental car shuttle getting filled quickly even mid-day on a weekday (when the driver saw we had four bags she said she probably shouldn't have stopped but let us on). I wish the terminals had two levels of roadways so you didn't have to take an escalator or elevator up to the check-in area.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-03-14,8,10,Sacramento Airport customer review,S Koenig,The new terminal which houses Southwest among other airlines is a definite step up. The train required to get from the main terminal to the departure gates was fast. There was a large variety of eateries near the gates. No haute cuisine but decent enough and better than in many other airports. The other older terminal is more run of the mill. My main complaint was that there seemed to be too few shuttle buses between the terminal and the consolidated rental car facility and they could quickly be overwhelmed. At least all rental car companies are housed together.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-11-09,9,10,Sacramento Airport customer review,B Parks,On our trip to Las Vegas my husband and I needed wheelchair assistance for the first time. He can not stand for long periods and can certainly not make the long distances to the gates without assistance. All the assistants were kind and accommodating. We could not have made this trip without this service. We do recommend however that your shuttle stop at all locations as needed in economy parking. We were dropped off at a lighted kiosk which required walking several rows to our car. They didn't announce our location was coming up.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-08-30,2,10,Sacramento Airport customer review,Jacque Behler,My husband and I just departed from Terminal B at the SAC airport. My husband is handicapped and needed wheelchair assistance. Securing a chair immediately was not a problem and airline agents at counter were great. My issues began at the security check. The agent at the scanning portal did not speak clearly as to where my husband was to wait for an agent to give him a pat down. He waited and waited for an agent to arrive. It made the whole security area seem disorganized. We also had a similar experience at our departure gate. Again our airline agent checking boarding passes called at least 4 times for assistance before she got confirmation that someone would eventually get there. Is this airport short handed or do they just not want to deal with the handicap.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-07-16,4,10,Sacramento Airport customer review,S Koenig,Airport is apparently in the process of a large expansion. Overall arrival and departure were fairly easy but the check-in area for Southwest Airlnes was very overcrowded (both the indoor check-in counter and outside curbside check-in area). The consolidated rental car facility was easy to use though there are few attendants in the lot to help you if you have any problem finding your car etc. One pleasant surprise was the low price of gas at the station on airport property; actually lower price than many in-town stations (though did not accept American Express) making it an easy choice when filling the tank before returning n your rental car. Lots of shops and restaurants in the airport once you pass through security.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
