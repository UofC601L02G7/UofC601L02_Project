I have used Midway airport regularly for almost 10 years. The recent change in the available restaurants selection has made it so that I don't eat here anymore. As a frequent flyer who has maintained status for every year of that time, this is a problem. They've removed a convenient, and inexpensive (!) Sandwich restaurant (Potbellys) and replaced it multiple times with a restaurant (Home Run Inn) that costs almost 2x as much for a simple sandwich. On the plus side, the new place appears to have the advantage of being slower also with less professional service. Truth be told, I like Home Run Inn Pizza. It's really good and I recommend you try a slice or two when you're in Chicago. However, pizza is more messy to eat than a sandwich. This is a big concern when you have on the same clothes you are going to attend a business meeting in. I like this airport, it's small, convenient and really easy to get around in. But this restaurant change is a travesty for me and food is a necessity. You've taken the normal routine of mild annoyance that air travel had become and taken it too a much higher level of annoyance. Now, I'm annoyed and hungry.

The airport boasts being green but the vendors will give you far more trash then you need. An example is, I went to buy a breakfast sandwich at the Greek place in the food court. They wrapped the sandwich in a sort of wax paper and put it in a small brown paper bag and then put it in a larger paper bag and then put in a fork and a knife and a pile of napkins. I told them a few times that I don't need need the fork, knife and extra bag and they can save I for someone else. So what did he do, he threw it in the garbage.

I was being dropped off at the airport and before I could even open the door the crazy person starts screaming ""You cant stop there"". How are people supposed to get out of the car you are not parking just getting. The time she wasted screaming was very unnecessary. The people need training on how to deal with the public doing your job is one thing but arguing with people is unnecessary. I stood and watched this idiot for about ten minutes doing the same to other cars. Two minutes is not a lifetime and Midway is getting to be the worst for dropping off and picking up passengers. The same when you pick up as soon as the car stops you are warned to keep moving. I can't stand those rude ignorant untrained people. Do they ever travel? Do they get the same treatment.",yes,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-04-22,6,10,Chicago Midway Airport customer review,S Miller,This airport is not large enough to handle the amount of passengers that go through it. It has insufficient seating due to the small nature of the terminal. Flights overlap and many passengers have trouble finding seats. Other than the lack of seating the airport is normal. The restrooms are very clean and can accommodate many so queues do not form.,,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2013-03-06,7,10,Chicago Midway Airport customer review,Lee Ho Seok,Recently flown in and out of MDW as well as transited through this airport. Would not be the best airport in the world but certainly better than ORD as well as many other U.S. airports. Cannot say much about check-in times as check-in at the counter mostly avoided due to web check-in but the security checkpoint sometimes could form quite a bit of queue. However the lines are processed relatively fast so no need to be totally terrified at the scene. Airside seems to be better than landside. The concourses are actually quite spacious with lots of eateries and other shops. The concourses and the restrooms fairly clean and well maintained. No free wifi but at least power outlets are abundant. Ground transportation also fair. The orange line connects MDW with downtown so at least a reliable option is there for those wanting to visit downtown. However no direct links from the interstate to MDW. Better option than ORD especially when transiting.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-08-05,9,10,Chicago Midway Airport customer review,Allan Rudy-Froese,I like that the gates where I as at (concourse A) there were no loud TVs or music playing. Travelling is loud enough. We don't need FOX or CNN filling our acoustic space. The free w-fi is as it should be.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2010-04-14,4,10,Chicago Midway Airport customer review,A Galanis,Very easy to transport yourself from gate to gate. Luggage area plenty of space and good display boards to find your luggage carousel. I appreciate airports that have glass pains where you can see the airline activity from any gate and Midway creates a nice travel atmosphere. could use more shops and eaterys.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-01-25,2,10,Chicago Midway Airport customer review,J Chou,I went through and connected at Midway during the holiday season and it was very stressing. The terminals seem cramped and were extremely crowded. The food choices were overpriced and with little variety but there seemed to be some nice sit down bistros etc for people with long layovers. The terminal was easy to navigate but hard to find the amenities. We wasted 10 minutes in our little layover just to find a pay phone. As I finally took a break at the restroom I found them there. With very little time we rushed to our connecting flight which was a disaster! In our packed flight our gate had barely any seats. Now our gate waiting area had very little space so fine. I understand. But wait! They put in big business type seats to waste space. People were everywhere and people were sitting on the floor and standing.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2007-08-06,4,10,Chicago Midway Airport customer review,David Guenthner,With the new concourses it's a good domestic connecting option. Gate areas seemed clean and I could find a chair near my boarding queue. The B concourse (Southwest/ATA) is very long but there is a moving walkway down most of it. I thought the concessions were quite good but there was not enough seating in the food court area.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
