2024-01-26,10,10,"""do not expect to be able to get coffee""",Sandra Dragomir,"Not Verified |  If you have an early flight, do not expect to be able to get coffee. There is a coffee shop, but it is never open. You can get coffee at 6 AM at every other airport. Why not here?",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2022-01-01,9,10,"""staff seem friendly and helpful""",Joseph Leonetti,"Not Verified |  Neat little airport. The staff seem friendly and helpful. If I remember, there are like 6 restaurants which is really good for a small regional airport. The restaurants are decently priced. If you pass through CAK, definitely try the ‘Buckhead Grill’. The terminal is fairly clean and a has a very expensive and modern feeling for a regional airport, though the terminal kind of looks like a mall. I think the worst part of the airport is the small parking. During peak hours, parking can get very limited. The staff really knows how to get you from A-B fast. They handle rushes and long lines very well. I recommend this airport instead of flying to places like Cleveland, because it is a little less frantic and dirty.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2017-05-06,10,10,"""the perfect size for someone on foot""",M Anderson,"✅ Verified Review |  
Easy to get around. It was the perfect size for someone on foot. The staff seemed like a small town community. Everyone seemed to be in effective communication with each other. Traveler satisfaction was clearly a priority for the staff at Akron Canton airport. I felt a good, positive energy there. I liked the choices of food and beer that were available throughout the gates. I liked how well my emotional support dog was greeted and welcomed into the airport and on all three flights I took home. I will fly to and from this airport in the future.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
