The transit is a drag, especially if you're going south, but you can survive. There are some nice (even if overpriced) restaurants as well. One unexpected experience was with the Global Entry program. I had applied to it earlier in 2022 so that I could get enrollment on arrival interview. Instead, the agent told us that they were not offering any interviews at this time and that we should schedule an appointment elsewhere (they seemed to be telling the same thing to everyone else). This seems to contradict what they say on their official website (which lists SFO and no other enrollment centers in the vicinity).

2023-01-10,6,10,"""Two contrasting experiences""",Charles Laing,"Not Verified |  Two contrasting experiences within two weeks. I was a transit passenger (AKL-SFO-LHR then back again), and knowing that transit doesn't exist at most US airports in the sense that they do at most non-US international hubs, I didn't check in bags but loaded up the hand luggage instead. Thus, I didn't experience the inanity of having to get my luggage and put it back on a conveyor belt landside. On my first trip, it took 65 minutes from disembarkation to clear immigration at 6:45am in the International Terminal, G-Wing. Long queues and few immigration staff on duty. Going back through security into the same wing, the staff were poor. They were shouting at various people who had English as a second language - because that generally works - and giving instructions that contradicted the screens above their heads. (Sample screen message: 'Have your boarding pass and passport ready to show the officer.' Officer: ""Don't show me your ticket!"" Nice one, champ.) I made the mistake of having my passport in my back pocket when I was about to go through the scanner. I realised at the last second, so went to put it in the tray and got full barrels from one chap who clearly hates his job. I acknowledged my error, told him it was an oversight, that I'd just been on a 12-hour flight, and that different airports have different rules. He then started berating an elderly Indian man for putting his shoes in the tray at the wrong angle. Mate, if you do don't have patience for people, get a job where you don't have to deal with them. On the way back, totally different: eight minutes from disembarkation to clearing immigration, lots of desks open at noon, friendly and helpful staff. Within the G-wing, there's an outdoor area with not much of a view, but which affords a good burst of fresh air, which is nice when you're on a plane or in an airport for 30-odd hours. I had a 10-hour layover on the way back and liked the big chairs. Got some good sleep in them. Shops were fine: typically overpriced but it's an airport so you'd expect no less. Landside, before security, there's some pretty cool yesteryear display cabinets, showing menus and service on flights in the 70s and 80s, and some pretty interesting art / design displays too. Signage seemed straightforward enough to me. Showers / nap rooms were extortionate. You need a mortgage. In the past, I've done all I can to avoid transiting through the US. Hong Kong, Tokyo, or Singapore are much more straightforward and amenable, but when I booked the flights, HKG and Tokyo were still closed, and Singapore Airlines were a bit expensive. Nothing about SFO would make me favour it over those other three, but I'd recommend it over LAX as an international transit airport.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2022-11-18,2,10,"""improve your signage in the terminal""",Barbara MacGregor,"Not Verified |  My 83 year old mother and I flew into SF Airport from a vacation in Puerto Vallarta, on our way home to Seattle. As it was our first port of entry we had to go through customs. Other than the rude and curt attendants organizing the lines, the customs process went pretty smoothly. Then the chaos ensued. We picked up our luggage and from there we had a very challenging time trying to figure out where to go next. There was virtually no signage about where to go or what to do. There was a baggage recheck station, staffed by a nice enough young man who had no clue where we should go or what we should do (and told us the exact opposite train to take to get to the Alaska terminal). Every person we asked gave us a different answer. We finally managed to get to the terminal that houses Alaska Airlines. We were told by one ""helpful"" airport personnel that we were already too late for our flight. We decided to try anyway. The Alaska assistance person said we had two minutes to get through TSA and board our flight to Seattle. We again decided to go for it. Luckily, I saw a fellow passenger from our first flight also in the TSA line; she said she was also on the Seattle flight and we still had a half hour. Good thing! Both my mother and I had to have every single carry on item go through the scanner twice, including removing her C-Pap, my bluetooth speaker, and my iPad. All had to go through x-ray again, separately. I was patted down. We were the very last people to get on our plane. Luckily, our luggage made it onto the plane, but my mom's suitcase never made it to the carousel in Seattle. If I could give some advice to SFO, please improve your signage in the terminal and on your shuttle train.

Once you finally make it to baggage claim, you have to go back upstairs and hope you see the one small sign for rental cars. This is yet another long walk with about half of it being an uphill ramp. Then, the signs are terrible. Nothing indicated rental cars until you get to the escalators. I can’t tell you how many people I saw looking around bewildered, as well as heard complaining about the walk. Follow the signs for the AirTran and take that all the way to the end.

2021-05-08,2,10,"""choose any airport over this one""",K Parker,"✅ Trip Verified |  If I were you, I would choose any airport over this one. If it's not the weather, it's ""runway renovations"" that cause flight delays for which apparently no one is responsible. For over 20 years, I have disliked this airport - it is dirty, with customer service representatives who apparently hate their job. It has been my only option for a specific sole airline that flies into a small airport north of SF, where my family lives. A couple years ago, I was heading to my family's hometown on a Friday for my husband's memorial service the next morning, where he had spent most of his adult life serving the public (the local service where we lived at the time of his death was for friends at our new home). Soon after my husband's death, due to shock, I had fallen down a ladder and broke my heel. For the trip, I had been recovering for 3 months and still used a cane. My flight to SF was delayed by SF due to weather - a common occurence. My connecting flight from SF to the hometown was delayed over and over on the hour. When I asked a customer service rep about this and explained that I needed to get to my husband's memorial service, he just shrugged. He had no answer whether the flight would go or not. At 11 p.m. that night, I requested wheelchair service to go to the car rental station, and the customer service rep just stared at me and acted like she didn't understand English. I went to a different desk and requested the same thing, then I rented a car to drive 5 1/2 hours to our hometown to make sure I could get to the memorial service. My understanding is that my connector flight never flew there that night. The airline carrier also did not refund me for that leg of the journey. In the most recent case this April, I recently flew the same route to visit family over spring break. On the return trip, SF delayed our takeoff for an hour, causing me to miss the last flight out of SF to my hometown. The reason -- runway renovations. By the time we arrived in SF Airport, there were no customer service reps available, no food available, and the airline customer service rep's only option was to hand me a flyer with an 800 number to reserve a hotel room ""at a discount"" for the night through Roomstorm, whereby I was charged by both Roomstorm for the very expensive hotel reservation as well as the hotel. I would not recommend this airport to anyone. I am thankful that soon the hometown airport will have a different carrier option, with direct flights to and from that completely bypass SF.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We went through customs easily with the chair, but when we collected our luggage, I couldn’t handle the luggage and my husband. He rolled himself from the luggage to where United Air collected luggage. We then had to go through TSA again. I inquired about pre-check in TSA and the official directing people yelled at me and because of her strong accent I couldn’t understand her. When I asked her again she just got furious and turned her back on us. We ended up in the non-pre TSA which was a nightmare with all our carry ons and a wheelchair. They took the wheelchair away and made my husband go through a complete search because his arm and hip replacements set off the equipment. Finally we reached the United Gate and they were almost through boarding even though we allowed plenty of time for this transition. We were sent out in the rain to get to our plane to San Luis Obispo. Because of the weather, they needed 8 volunteers to get off the plane for weight reasons. Finally they decided to remove all the baggage so o one had to leave the plane. (Good idea). The plane took off 1.5 hours late. United Air did a good job of Tracking our luggage. It went down to LA and arrived several hours later in San Luis Obispo. When I tried to pick up my luggage in SLO, the clerk at the united counter was the rudest person and of no help. She instructed me to stand by a door and hope someone would help me. It took 20 minutes. A very nice airport employee, arriving for work took pity on me and opened the door that had the luggage.

We repeatedly ask if she could pass through the easier side in which she would be able to use her crutches, but for some reason she was denied the opportunity numerous times. However, once it was my turn to go through (noted I was only 2 people behind my wife) I was pushed to the other side of the metal detector machine instead in which we had ask for my wife to go through. Once the scanner had done its job she was expected to hop with one leg out of the machine since her crutches were being scanned. She was holding up the line, so the TSA tried to assist her by putting hands on her, but obviously my wife couldn’t take the help since she is not able to maneuver without the crutches. This was so humiliating in all aspects. TSA officers need to go through a sensitive and judgement course in which they are thought to be human beings and make better decisions. The supervisor was rude and backed her employe even though she was wrong. She continued to argue that her employee was not aware of the anxiety she was causing my wife, she had a meltdown while being patted down.

Immigration is either hit or miss mostly the latter. And don't even ask about customs officials. They profile certain races which is not only archaic but unfair.

After that he disappeared. People backed up back to the gate. So if more than 3 hours are not enough to get a connection, then I guess you cannot go through SFO at all.

2018-01-12,4,10,"""I try to avoid SFO""",Nick Shadoff,"✅ Trip Verified | I fly weekly for business, and my client for the past year has been in the San Francisco Bay area - so I've flown into and out of all three Bay Area airports, Oakland, San Jose, and San Francisco. Overall, I would say that SFO has great shopping and dining, is wonderfully decorated, is convenient to drive into and out of - and totally blows at making airplanes land and take off on time. In the past year, I have had a higher percentage of my flights into and out of SFO delayed than at any other airport. When I check FlightAware, in general the other two Bay Area airports will be on-time, while SFO will be delayed. I have been delayed due to fog, winds, air traffic, runway construction and smoke. The most heinous delay was when airport operations decided to ""flip the airport"" - switch which direction traffic would land and take off - which made every airplane on the ground, even ones lined up to take off, have to then taxi around to a different runway. This happened after they closed the boarding door on my flight and put us twenty-sixth in line for take-off and delayed us for over an hour. This was one of the only two times I've ever actually missed a connecting flight. Other than SFO's near-incompetence with their core function, the airport is largely okay. I fly American from Terminal 2, but I go through security at the Delta terminal, Terminal 1, because there are currently only 8 gates in operation there, and I can go through PreCheck in less than 5 minutes, then walk over to T2 inside security. The tram that runs to the rental car facility is rather slow, but does the job fairly stress-free.

2017-12-08,7,10,"""Overall, it's a decent airport""",S Nelson,"❎ Not Verified |  
SFO is my home airport. I've flown domestically a couple of times out of it, but with the lack of service on domestic airlines, I really don't like flying on US carriers. Thus, my review is a compilation of experiences on both departures and arrivals at SFO over the last six years. My wife and I travel two to three times a year, mostly to Asia to visit her relatives. Most of the TPAC flights we've taken out of SFO have been late night and the security line experience has been quite quick. SFO doesn't use TSA agents. They were allowed to hire contract employees instead and the difference shows, at least in the international security lines. I believe the longest I've taken in a security line is about 15 minutes, and that was for a rare day flight. So departures are typically pretty good. Arrivals have been a different story. We got into the Global Entry system pretty early in the game, back before credit card offers to reimburse the $100 fee were common. We did it after one particularly heinous arrival in which two 380's and a couple of 777's all landed within minutes of each other, coupled with a computer glitch, caused the lines to simply be ridiculous. If you're familiar with the arrivals layout, you know there's a gate way the heck down at the far end of the arrivals hall. That's where the back of the line was. I believe it was 2.5 hours to get through immigration after all was said and done. But even before that, lines were typically about an hour long, even when fewer than the maximum number of flights land simultaneously. Global Entry changed that for us. The last flight we took arrived back in SFO on December 5th at 6.16pm, according to FlightAware. We were in my brother-in-law's car at 6.45 with our baggage. Lounges at SFO are pretty spartan. We have the Priority Pass, and the only lounge that's available in the entire airport, domestic or international, is on the OneWorld (AA) side of international departures. None are in domestic departures. And the international departure area is separated to such an extent that if you go to the OneWorld side and your flight is departing on the Star Alliance side, you have to back out from the secure area and then pass security on the other side. Not a well thought out design. We've also used the United Lounge, and those are pretty universally grim. Signage is good. The food and beverage on the airside, while a little steep (what airport isn't), was pretty decent. While it's possible to get to and from the airport on public transit, I wouldn't recommend it. BART is a pretty poorly run system and security is not exactly their forte, so I would imagine someone with suitcases would be seen as easy pickings. My one experience with the super shuttle was a Zero Dark Thirty ride one morning from our house about 10 miles away. For my wife and I, it was about $20. Overall, it's a decent airport. It won't compare with the Changi's, Incheon's or even Bangkok airports of the world, but it's serviceable and, sadly, it represents one of the better airports in the country.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'December 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Make sure you have 2.5 hrs or more. The customs alone took about 45 min. I still had to claim my baggage, recheck them and go through security. I mentioned to security that I was late for my next flight and I was transferring. The guy said they don't expedite passengers (and yet many of the good reviews for their airport says they do?) so that’s a complete lie. He nicely suggested I could ask others if I could cut. Here, sadly, it’s common for people to be asking others to cut at security because they are late for their flights. To be fair, so far no staff were rude, just indifferent. But one young guy near the right side security conveyer belts (right before the scanning machine), when I asked him what should I do, grinned and rudely said ""it’s not my problem"". I didn’t have time to get his name. I had only 5 minutes to get to gate 90 (yep, the one at the very end) and had to run with all I had. Once I got to my flight 1 min past the boarding time officially ending, the crew was nice enough to still let me on.

We arrived on BART then took the light rail to the terminal. Check-in was a bit of a walk from the light rail, but we aren't old. We had arrived early for the earlier of the two BA flights so security was quiet and fast. But that's the end of the good news. SFO has totally dropped the ball. I don't want to hang around before security because I want to get the chore out of the way. But after security there is almost nothing but bathrooms and gate seating. There's a small cafe serving plastic wrapped food near security, a crummy little over priced personal pizza and plastic wrapped food restaurant right at the end on the right and an expensive and thoroughly disappointing coffee shop on the left. There are no proper sit down restaurants. The only stores are the over priced duty free and the usual tourist junk stores. There's no good book shop, there's no pub, there's no waited table service. There isn't even a cafeteria or food court style restaurant. They built this huge terminal with it's millions of dollars taller than it has any need to be statement of a check-in hall but they forgot all about the fact that people want to pass their waiting time in the departure lounge in some comfort. It's more like a railway station than an airport. For a heavy jet it seems to take ages to taxi for takeoff from the east-west runways, but it is all factored in to the expected duration, so relax, you are leaving and someone will finally provide, oh right, airplane food. Why couldn't I get a decent meal at the airport? Returning to SFO we had booked a rental car, cheaper than a taxi and much more pleasant than a shuttle, we did a one way to KOAK which is just a few miles from home and cut out the waiting and sharing and discomfort. The aircraft taxi time is a lot less for arrivals. We got off the plane promptly but some other flights were in too. Immigration now has electronic service. I hope you look like you. But they haven't improved baggage handling. Airports like Manchester in the UK should give masterclasses to the sluggard baggage handlers at SFO, I have got off the front of an A330 in Manchester, flashed my European passport in the EU lane and walked straight in to the baggage claim to see my bag already waiting for me there. No danger of that at SFO. Any time will do. Even with a nearly new and purpose designed facility they are in no hurry to do their job. So we stand and wait and wait. Eventually the bags turn up. Show the paperwork to the customs guy and you are on your way. Out the door through the throng of people not waiting for us then follow the signs up to the light rail and a few minutes later you are deposited at the car rental facility. I am a frequent renter with several companies, this time I took Alamo and we were in the car and leaving inside of ten minutes after getting off the train. Join the loyalty programs, they are well worth the time. We can go over the Bay Bridge or San Mateo, both are about the same distance and both are well sign posted from the car rental exit.

Leaving us still waiting on the tarmac for another 20 minutes. Finally they moved us to another gate and we were able to disembark. There should have been better organisation at the airport to prevent such delays. When we got inside the terminal we had to walk a long distance to the immigration desks where there was a very long queue. Many of the desks were closed and the area was totally unprepared for the numbers of people coming through despite it being mid-afternoon. There were no staff controlling the queues so some people were able to skip ahead of others. Very badly organised. Finally got through to baggage claim. There were a number of other people at the carousel and we waited for our luggage for ages. Then we realised that the luggage from our flight had been taken off and left aside.
