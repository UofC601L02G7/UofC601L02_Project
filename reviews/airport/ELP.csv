2022-08-25,9,10,"""the best airport to be stranded in""",Marlene Friesen,"Not Verified |  My flights were delayed for many hours due to weather in Dallas. El Paso airport is the best airport to be stranded in! It has an easily-accessed smoking area in a lovely courtyard. It's small enough to get around quickly, but big enough to have decent food. My delays would have been much worse in a larger airport, but El Paso airport made my delays manageable. Staff were also great. Security and the like (especially outside directing vehicle traffic) were nice and helpful, offering extra help or information if I needed it. Love this airport! The only minor annoyance was that it did not have a lot of charging ports in the seating areas, so I had to stand while my phone was charging.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-12-15,7,10,"""queuing times acceptable""",Miguel Salcedo-Gomez,"It's an old airport but there aren't any other choices in the area. Terminal is rather dim considering the perpetual sunshine for which El Paso is known. It seems that they're expanding the terminal. Queuing times acceptable. Being a border area may elicit additional screening from the immigration/customs officers no matter how long you've living here. Foreign citizens lawfully in the Country are recommended to take their passports in addition to their IDs. Excellent wifi signal, shopping options are limited but ok. Again, the terminal looks dim and this makes it look less inviting.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-04-01,10,10,El Paso Airport customer review,J Palmer,I've lived in El Paso for two years now for school and I often use the airport to visit my hometown as well as other destinations. The busiest I've ever seen the airport from the time of walking through the doors checking baggage going through security and getting to my gate was about 40 minutes (Christmas vacation time). I've even got through in 20 minutes. It's a smaller airport with only one terminal that's ever used and about 10-15 gates (so from security to walk to your gate takes maybe 4-5 minutes). This isn't one of the airports you'll need to devote 2 hours in order to get through it. I'd say 1 hour is fine (because you never know even if it does only take 30 minutes to get to your gate) and maybe 1.5 during busy holiday times or if you're going to have to check the whole family (might even be 2 hours for that).,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-03-13,8,10,El Paso Airport customer review,Steven Dratler,This airport was a small typical airport for a city of this size but it seems to be really under used. Very little planes are seen taking off or landing when driving by this airport. The terminal is quiet and peaceful so don't arrive too early. Overall a pleasant experience. The only problem I had is how there is no shade at the curbside area so be warned about that. Other than that I don't have much to complain about.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2008-01-15,5,10,El Paso Airport customer review,Keith McWilliams,Modern new airport. Many hotels nearby almost within walking distance. Fort Bliss borders and shares airport runway with civilian airport. Many military personnel fly out from this airport. Security departing second visit slow planned for 1 hour to get through security and needed it. If you plan to travel across the border to Juarez by car 10 minutes to get to border from airport. Plan one to two hours for return trip back across border because of US custom check. Encounter one waitress in El Paso who could not speak English. Depending where you are in Juarez you can get by with very little Spanish.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
