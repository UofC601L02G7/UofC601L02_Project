We can see the weather now rolling on meaning this hour will be extended further escalating aggravation onboard. The airline was quick to clear us as landed in their system to give the facade of a timely travel experience but that is a complete fabrication of the truth.

As a frequent flyer, out of all three terminals, across several carriers, this airport is pathetic. Between the sheer lack of on site parking, the lack of employees that speak English and unimaginably poor ground service, I loathe this place. I will do anything I can to avoid checking a bag because I know I am in for a minimum of a 30 minute wait at baggage claim. That’s on a good day. The wait for a gate to taxi to, the wait for a jet way brought to the plane, then the incredible, inevitable wait at baggage. Carry on only isn’t always an option for me. As one waits, the announcements are made at times only in Spanish, but when they do make it in English, usually secondary to the Spanish, it’s incomprehensible. Listen at any baggage claim, you’ll hear passengers complaining about them. After a ridiculous wait, when you finally get your bag, it’s smash to bits. Every.Single.Time. Of every airport I travel, world wide, my home airport, MCO, is a disaster.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Second time departing Orlando and they tell me I have something between my legs. They told me either they feel me all over in front of everyone or they take me to a room to strip down. Mind you I’m traveling with a small child. They really need to learn courtesy and be more polite. Is this how they are being trained?

2024-04-16,3,10,"""continues to get worse and worse""",Kimberly White,"Not Verified |   I live in Orlando, so use this airport frequently. I don't know what is happening but it continues to get worse and worse. I flew internationally for holiday and returned last evening (April 15th). I left out of Terminal A and returned to Terminal C. I parked in North Lot. Apparently you can take a shuttle from C to the South Lot but not the North Lot. WHY? So I had to take a shuttle to Terminal A to then take another shuttle to my vehicle in North Lot. The shuttle took forever to arrive to C. I saw other shuttles (Mears, off site parking etc) circle two or three times while I waited for the shuttle to take me to A. When it did arrive, me and other other 3 passengers all informed him we were going to A, however he dropped us at Terminal B and told us that was his only stop. So I then had to drag my luggage across the airport to get to Terminal A to catch the next shuttle. That shuttle arrived slightly faster, however the driver didn't even get out of his seat to help any of the passengers board. He just sat there staring at us. A nice passenger helped me load my luggage onboard. I had asked a couple people in the airport how to get where i was going and one girl actually told me ""it wasn't her job to answer that question"". When I did get to my vehicle and went to pay and leave the attendant couldn't have been any more annoyed that I was trying to pay her. She barely could extend her arm to take my payment and seemed severely pissed off she had to actually perform a function. I traveled to three countries and therefore three airports and am sadly embarrassed how our city is represented with regard to our airport. After customs and retrieving my bags, it took me 2 hours to get to my vehicle last night which is horrible. Why is there no shuttle to North Lot from C? Why doesn't the shuttle that is supposed to take you to A not actually take you to A? Why are the workers so rude and unhelpful.

The public announcements were a joke and they were being read like it a joke by a person who sounded about 10 years old. They kept repeating that people are not allowed to use phones in the terminal, and yet looking around guess what, everyone is on their phones because that's what travellers need to do! Being asked to pay $30 for a baggage trolley. (£1 in the UK). Massive queues for the immigration lanes - we waited for over 2 hours. This terminal is very badly designed. No opportunity to purchase any refreshments and no seats. There are no shops whatsoever in the airport on the way to the hire car. (we rented a villa so a shop would have been really handy) Outbound - Similar experience, very few shops and no opportunity to buy any duty free. Encountered extremely rude & cranky TSA operatives. I ended up getting angry myself at the way I was being shouted at and left my iPad/tablet behind. It would have been fine but the tray with this item ended up on a different conveyer belt and I didn't realise I'd left it behind until I was on the flight. To add insult to injury, MCO Lost and Found have said the only option to get my item returned will cost me $349 via UPS. This is an absolute joke as the UPS website quotes me a fraction of this price. The item itself is worth about $150. When you consider MCO auctions thousands of lost electrical items for profit (ggauctionsonline.net), this little operation seems to be lining somebody's pockets at MCO.

Then when our parents attempted to do this they were spoke to in a demeaning tone and said they couldn’t do this.

To get through the line to have baggage checked by security can take very little time but the screening process takes forever if they have to pull your bags. It requires a supervisor who has led feet and all slow the process down and make things annoyingly tedious. There were 4 people in wheelchairs awaiting their baggage for almost a half hour while I and 4 others were also waiting for someone to expedite the process of opening and checking bags.  Service is slow all over, there is nowhere to sit and when you do find a seat it’s covered in crumbs, old turkey and goo from the 1980s. No where to charge your phone or get work done. Not business friendly whatsoever.  No retail spaces to pass the time. Folks sitting on the floors everywhere you look.

If you can help it at all, do not fly into or out of this airport. We were departing back to Philadelphia from Florida yesterday and arrived at the airport with 2 hours and 45 minutes before our flight. Walked into a line wrapped around the entire one side of the airport wondering what the hell was going on. Turns out it was the security line. There had to be over 600 people in this line, all very disgruntled to say the least. It took us over two hours to get to security. We rushed our things through and ran to catch the shuttle with our shoe laces untied. Luckily got onto the shuttle as the doors were closing and sprinted to our gate from there with about 5 minutes to spare before the doors closed and we missed our flight. The thought of missed our flight only to have to go back to ticketing and returning to that torturous security line again was enough to make us prepare to drive two hours to another airport to fly out of. Despite the fact that we made our frontier flight by a hair, we ended up sitting on the plane for another 30 minutes to wait for the 56 (!!) passengers that were still not present for that was supposed to be a full flight. The airline waited for about half of them to get onto the plane and had to leave the other 20 some passengers behind. This experience alone made an otherwise decent trip a horrible experience that we were left with. I will never ever ever fly into or out of this airport again and urge others to consider the same. Aside from the insane waiting and stressful rushing to our gate, the staff at the airport was very rude and cavalier about the situation. Non apologetic, no concern and just flat out rude. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. On top of everything, we were practically starving for a period of 5 hours since the time we thought we might have to grab a quick bite before our flight was spent stressing in an insane line and frontier doesn’t serve anything on the plan for passengers.

I approached one of TSA to ask question. Her response, “just go over there.” Apparently sharing a joke with her friend is more important than the security of the airport.

Very disappointed to see that there were only 2 agents allocated for our line, while that line for locals had more than 7 agents. As a result it took us more than 1:30h to pass the immigration controls. Then, they took me to the customs office with the excuse of having a common name (they didn't provide more explanations but the way the agent explained didn't sound very convincing, besides it was the first time that it happened to me in US territory). Time spent in the office, 30 minutes. After the office I finally got to pick my lugagge, only to discover that it had to go through a 2nd security check and that we had to pick it in another terminal. Sadly when we got to the pick up terminal, part of the lugagge didn't come out. Nobody from the airport or airline was present to assist us. I asked to another passenger in the same situation and he told me that this messy inconvenient was really normal in the airport. We sat for more than 1 hour besides the belts, until the last bag finally came out. It took me 3 hours to fly from Panama to Orlando and incredibly it took me more than 4 hours to try to go out of the Airport. These guys have no idea of customer experience.

You arrive after 9.5 hours in the air to go through a small area with no refreshments or bathroom facilities and then you put your passport into the machines getting a ticket which has cleared you for entry. Once out of this area you are the herded by ill informed rude staff to meet the customs officials and get asked the same questions by these people, some of whom are really nice others can be really obnoxious. So you land at 3.30 pm and get your baggage at 6.00 p.m. Not acceptable. Get this new area sorted get your entry system sorted, get your staff trained in customer service.

The airport is organized and although there is a high amount of passenger traffic everything runs smoothly. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping areas as well as an Apple store which is awesome. The airport is super clean and transportation shuttles are everywhere so you will always get to your gate on time. I have almost never experienced delays at this airport even during international departures. There is also great Wi-Fi through out the whole airport.

Goodness knows how much longer the other passengers, visitors and US citizens mixed together had to wait before being let into the passport lines, which were long enough that it would have taken at least two hours total from landing for them to enter the country. Once we got to the Global Entry line there were only two machines, and one was out of service. The one machine available did not operate properly for many of those in the line with us and in my case it failed to recognize that I had Global Entry, even though the passport official we finally got to admitted that we did.

The majority of the plane were families with young children and had similar experiences, I had a toddler with me as well. Its an absolutely cruel experience for the little ones. We waited over an hour in a room for our luggage, in which three other flights of people were waiting too. We then had to get a shuttle to the main airport to leave, there was no elevators and I was told by the security guard that I could not go on the escalator with a pram/stroller, I had to drag the pram with a toddler in my arms up the flight of stairs, with two security guards watching happily (I was previously told I would be assisted). A security guard was directing the flock of people through to the shuttle inwhich she had physically pushed my sister in that direction due to it being so over-crowded. In all it took us around 4 hours to get out of the airport, as we waited a silly amount of time to get the rental car out as well.

I then asked: ""Do you think I can make it"", he says with such plain tones: ""I don't know, you need to arrive early"". And then he turned his back to me again! It wasn't like there were other people around waiting for his help. Thank goodness that the lady at the entrance (who was super busy) was kind enough to tell us that we can make it and we actually made it.

We had around 8 bags and there was no porter service available. Worst part is once we somehow managed to move our carts outside the immigration and baggage pick up we been told that we have to drop our bags at another belt and take the train which will take us to main arrival halls where we had to pick up our luggage again.

The ceiling was falling down and the queues took us all directly beneath the fragile looking ceiling panels. There we queued for another 1hr and a half before progressing to baggage reclaim where despite the time taken so far we still had to wait for our bags. Then we had to go upstairs via an escalator (Staff at bottom ensuring we could be crammed on, young families with their suitcases), so dangerous! Signage seemed ok. We also flew out twice, both domestic flights and a further arrival also domestic within the space of a week. The security queues on outbound flights were about 30 mins long but staff were on hand to make the various lines as quick as possible. Of course we didn't have to suffer the immigration queues and that is their problem. There appear to be new self service immigration consoles in place but weren't in use at that time.

I had a 2-hour layover in Orlando on October 30th which should have been enough time considering I didn’t have any luggage. The plane landed at 5pm, but due to congestion we were not allowed to disembark until 6pm. Since I knew I wasn’t going to have much time, I downloaded the Mobile Passport App to make immigration faster (I had very good experiences with the App in ATL and JFK). However, when I noted to the staff at immigration that I had submitted mine through Mobile Passport, she rudely said that they ""weren't doing that"". Thankfully the line for US citizens was short and I was out of there in 15 minutes. I followed the signs for connecting flights and had to go through security to get to the main gates, which didn’t take long. Unfortunately, when I got the gates and I checked to screens to confirm my gate number, I noticed that my flight was not posted. I asked a friendly staff in the information kiosk and he informed me that I must be at the wrong terminal and I had to take a shuttle to the correct terminal and get out of the airport and go through TSA again. I panicked since it was 6:15pm and my flight was supposed to start boarding at 6:20pm. I arrived at the correct terminal and spoke with a staff member at the exit and she advised that indeed I would have to go through TSA again. When I told her that my flight had started boarding she said “Yeah, you’re definitely going to miss your flight.” Once I arrived at security check I looked for the TSA pre-check line (which I have) but didn’t see it, so asked the person directing everyone in line and I also mentioned that my flight had already started boarding and he said “You’re probably going to miss your flight but just enter here and ask the staff at the front if you can go in the priority line.” When I arrived at the front of the line before the boarding pass check, I asked the staff member if I could go in the priority line since my flight had started boarding and she said “no, sorry!.” I started panicking, so I asked if the fact that I have TSA Pre-Check made a difference and she said “uhm, TSA pre-check is on the other side” and pointed me to it. I rushed over to the TSA pre-check area and was able to complete the security check in 15 minutes, which compared to everything else in this airport, it was a breeze. Finally, the inefficiency of this airport worked to my advantage and although I arrived 5 minutes after my flight was supposed to take off, there were people still boarding the plane. Moral of the story, I just came believe I had so many staff member telling me that I was going to miss my flight, but none tried to do anything about it. I also don’t understand why the TSA pre-check line is so hidden that not even the staff members know where it is.

",H Gibson,"✅ Verified Review |  A shambles of an airport. After a long flight from the UK we were told by the apologetic captain that we were being held on the tarmac due to there being no free gates available to disembark. He mentioned how it was ridiculous that an airport of their size wasn't prepared for our arrival. When we finally disembarked an hour later, we entered the worst immigration queues I have ever had the misfortune of standing in. Two and a half hours it took, in a room with no air conditioning. We had a toddler that didn't understand what was going on and almost collapsed in the heat. No one was offering water or seats, just warnings that phones must be kept in pockets. To add insult to injury we had to endure the constant repeating of the flash entry video about how easy they make immigration. It was inhumane how they treated people, coming into their country to spend a lot of money. Eventually we got to baggage claim where our bags had been removed from the belts and deposited anywhere there was room. Then we were greeted with huge queues at the car rental desks. It may sound sensationalist, but it has honestly put me off travelling to Orlando again. The way out wasn't much better. An hour and a half to get through security on the way out. Staff looked like they didn't care and were rude and arrogant. I'm not sure I understand the idea of all the best shops and restaurants being before the security checks either. You can't spend any time browsing as you don't know how long it's going to take to get through. Once you get through security your choice is severely limited. Can I make one suggestion?

I can only echo the reviews of everyone else here. This is no way to treat people, especially by a country that is supposedly the most advanced in the world. The slick videos they play in arrivals are the complete opposite to the actual experience. The officer we had was actually pleasant but it takes an age to process each group. The most frustrating thing is that most people coming into MCO are there ultimately to spend a lot of money in the local economy so everything should be done to make the entry process as efficient and welcoming as possible. I for one will never fly into MCO again. Finally, a tip for car renters. Having got through customs over two hours after we landed we then faced the biggest queues ever at the car rental desk in terminal B. Literally two or three people on duty to serve a queue of at least 30 and we all know how long we have to spend at the desk as they try and up sell everything. I went and spoke to one of the other car rental agents as I could see another two hour wait on the horizon, initially to see if I could hire something from them for 24 hours to then come back to collect our pre-pay car the next day. She took me over to Terminal A and said queues are usually much less there than in Terminal B. She was right. One person in front of me and a two hour wait avoided. I told a few beleaguered families at the back of the queue in Terminal B on my return. Always pays to be a fox not a sheep.

2017-07-17,1,10,"""this is woefully inadequate""",M Robinson,"✅ Verified Review |  I travel internationally at least once a month and being that I live in Brevard County, Florida, I always travel through Orlando International Airport. Since October of 2016, each and every single time I have arrived at Orlando International Airport, the flights have been forced to sit on the tarmac or at the gate because the airport’s immigration service is unable to process more travelers. The wait times have typically been between 30 minutes and 60 minutes. When you finally are allowed to arrive in immigration, you will find that the wait times to pass through immigration are very long (unless you have Global Entry, which I have). Be prepared to spend at least 30 – 45 minutes. Once you finally pass through immigration you will enter into the baggage reclaim area. Note that the international baggage claim has only three baggage carousels. Recognizing that this is woefully inadequate, the airport management assigns teams of workers that rearrange and shuffle baggage as it arrives at each carousel. Of course, eventually the carousels become so overwhelmed with baggage that the workers have to remove the bags and start stacking them about the baggage area wherever there is room. Be aware that your bags may be stored on the floor areas along side the carousel. Again, this is not new or temporary. It has been going on without improvement for a very long time. As you’re waiting for your bags – get ready as this can be very long- I experienced times from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. When you finally do get your luggage you will need to head off to the tram that will take you to the main terminal. If it is not working, which does happen, then be prepared to haul your luggage and kin for a half-mile through hot (and maybe rainy) weather. Of course, the airport will tell you that they will provide a bus if this occurs but realize this is not a speedy exercise. The last bit is the on-going renovations inside the main terminal. Currently (mid 2017) the escalators are sporadically available. If you plan to retrieve your vehicle or rental car from the parking area, be prepared. The elevators (3 in total in any one area) will have a load of passengers waiting to move to one of the three levels. When one finally opens for you, the flood gates open. If you are not standing in front of the one that arrives, you probably won’t make it in. The wonderful feature of these elevators is, as people are scrambling to pack into the elevator that just arrived, the remaining elevators will not attempt a pick-up because the last arriving elevator cancels the selection for your floor. You will have to wait for the filling elevator door to completely close before you can attempt to again summons another elevator. Bottom line, if you are arriving from an international flight (especially with a connection) to MCO then give yourself plenty of time (I would say 3 hours), as it will not be a speedy transit time.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

They forced Terminal B passengers to take the Terminal A train, but then line up to wait for shuttle busses to redirect them from A to B. I was lucky and quick to follow instructions. It ""only"" took me 45 minutes after passing through security to reach Terminal B. I can't say for sure, but looking at the 250-300 people who were stuck in lines behind me, as well as the slowness of airport staff to instruct people and get them on shuttle busses, I'd guess that many took over 1-1/2 hour just to get to their Terminal after passing through security. The worst part was that the airport clearly knew this was going to happen weeks in advance (they had professionally printed signage to put up) but the staff had no idea what to do, what to say or how to help travelers. I truly felt sorry for passengers with infants or senior travelers who would have been so helpless and fearful. Staff members contradicted each other, didn't know when or where to put up signage, told people to move to other areas that made no sense (imagine being pushed into a Terminal A train when you need to be at Terminal B) and were not prepared for the hundreds of passengers that piled into line for shuttle busses (that took 25 minutes to arrive once we had lined up.).

I travel extensively all over the world, however the last time I had to fly via Orlando MCO was thankfully 2003 as it was pretty dreadful even then! I had the opportunity to visit a friend in Fort Myers and the only flight I could get came into Orlando, so I decided to fly and drive. My flight with Virgin Atlantic came in on time and we were all about to disembark when we were told we had to remain on the plane for an additional 30 minutes due to the fact that 'immigration was so busy'! We all waited patiently, and eventually allowed off the plane, just to join an enormous queue for the passport identification machines. Thinking this would speed things along, I waited a further 20 mins and eventually had my passport scanned and photo taken. We then turned the next corner to discover another snaking queue for the passport security check! After waiting a further 30 minutes, I eventually got in front of the Passport Control Security Officer, who I can honestly say was one of the most rude, acerbic and disrespectful men I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. He basically grilled me for around 10-15 minutes on every aspect of my life professional and personal. I eventually picked up my bag from the carousel, in a room with no air conditioning on day with temperature around 89 degrees, just to discover the necessity to join yet another huge snaking queue to show my documents yet again! This took a further 20 minutes and at this point, people were starting to look seriously unwell, with old people looking faint and babies crying non stop. In total this rigmarole took around 2 hours and all before having to get the shuttle to the other terminal in order to queue yet again to pick up my hire car. Unfortunately, I have to travel through the same airport with my children at the end of June and I can honestly say I am absolutely dreading the experience. Not only will it be even hotter then, but due to holidays I'm sure it will be twice as crowded! If they weren't coping with the volume of passengers in May, I really can't see how they will cope during the annual holidays. On the return flight, the security was yet again in total chaos with massive delays and once I got through this unpleasant part of travelling, there was basically only one restaurant which served table dinning; quite unbelievable for an International Airport. There also appeared to be no flight information whatsoever on the flight departures and the only way to get an update was to go to the actual gate. My advice to anyone with the choice, would be to fly into a neighboring airport, even if it's two hours or more away and just drive. I flew into San Francisco International back in March and the experience, could not have been different. The staff were quick, efficient and extremely polite an helpful. The whole process from leaving the aircraft to leaving the terminal was around 30 mins in total. I can therefore only sum up and say I will make sure everyone I know, avoids Orlando International at all costs.

After we were allowed off the queues were horrendous and even after using the APC machines had to queue to see and be questioned by an immigration official also dealing with non machine authorized people. The best welcome from the immigration officer was to tell me that I wasnt allowed to hold my cell phone in my hand, even after telling him it was turned off, and he said I had to put it in my pocket. He even grilled me as to why I was travelling alone but looked sheepish when I told him my wife died tragically 18 months ago, but he didnt manage to say ""Oh I am sorry to hear that"" as most people do, especially after a 9 hr flight and 3 hour unnecessary delay. Then there was a horrendous queue at Customs making it difficult to get bags off and then to get to the exit. Overall I was delayed 3 and half hours from landing, the only consolation was that talking to Virgin and Lufthansa passenger arriving at roughly the same same said they were delayed 4 hours! Can you imagine the pain for about 2000 people arriving and being delayed by an average of 3 hours. What an awful airport, will never fly to MCO directly again, they just cant cope and don't seem to want to welcome people or to help to reduce the delays.

Decent food options, easy access from city, good signage and easy to navigate. Unfortunately, both the TSA security setup and the TSA staff is just plain horrendous compared to TSA at all other airports I have ever been to. I'm a frequent traveler. 2-4 flights a month is normal, and sometimes it's a lot more than that. I have been to over 30 airports in the country and I've never seen a TSA setup like this. Lines coming from 2 different, opposite terminal entrances running into each other and then being allowed in one at a time. It's quite bizarre especially given the elegant alternative of just splitting the available security lanes into two - one for each terminal. This creates a lot of blockages and inefficiency as each side is temporarily halted while the other side goes on. The TSA staff only adds to this confusion. Not only are the staff incompetent at this airport, as is evident from their mismanagement of the lines, they are also rude, almost all angry, and very loud and unempathetic. I saw people getting yelled at unnecessarily, being made to wait, being given conflicting instructions and just generally having a bad experience over the course of 2 different departures in the same week from this airport. This is not including my own personal experience where it took 3 agents to resolve the security threat of me having a personal flask of water with...water inside. Instead of being allowed to drain it or drink it, I was sent back outside and forced to go through the entire security process again. My only other option was throwing the flask which was a biryhday gift and which I didn't want to forfeit. Overall, this airportms TSA general manager needs to look into the situation.

The immigration officer who processed my family was quite unpleasant and brusque in manner. He certainly needed further customer service training. Afterwards we collected our bags from the carousel and made our way over towards customs and the transfer carousel. A tannoy announcement instructed passengers to either put their bags on the transfer carousel (not recommended as it takes an age for bags to arrive) or to take luggage onto the train. We elected to put our cases onto the train with us and then further walked to Ground Transportation. Two weeks later we returned via this airport and ate at the food court before entering the security lines. We were given a Preferred Lane but upon rounding a corner simply merged into all the other lanes. One TSA officer shouted that the bags will not move by themselves and that shoes should not be placed in the plastic bins. Why not have a sign indicating that instruction then?

However, our arrival in MCO was ridiculous: held on plane for 30 mins (after 10hr flight) at gate, because airport could not accept any more passengers to queue at that time. Once inside, waited further 40 mins in grungy first holding area, to be taken through in groups of 20 to next main queue, where you could see the processing desks and officers. We waited approx. 30 mins more in this next queue with a tired child, limited seats and little information. Eventually, in our wait during the next queue, one of the staff asked (apparently randomly) our last travel dates to US, it was within two years and we were directed to a new area of self-serve booths - thus bypassing the main queue we had been waiting for, but without any apparent planning or reason for us being asked. The same applied to a few behind us and then we cleared within about 20 mins after that, repeating the photo/fingerprinting again with an officer despite having done that with the booth. Overall, I found the whole approach very disorganised, even US citizens were not clearly directed or advised it seemed, as several ended up in our queue for a while, before being redirected elsewhere. I noted on our return to UK that they have now set up 'family' lines, seperately from adult travellers, which is a good idea (whether you are travelling without kids and want the peace of not queuing en masse or are with a family and perceive a faster service by being separated). I would agree with other reviewers that better queue splitting, organisation and signage would drastically improve the arrival experience and most likely speed of processing at MCO. (Our wait for over an hour at BUDGET car rental desk, which was the only one with such a ridiculous line, only added to the overall negative impression of the arrival). We would recommend anyone travelling to use Avis or Hertz based on what we witnessed of efficiency and customer service. For the £30.00 we saved on our car hire pre-paying on Expedia, it wasn't worth the experience with Budget and we would not use them again, anywhere - despite a positive experience with their office in downtown Orlando, whose operator was excellent. Perhaps they should swap the team around as collectively the four or so staff we saw at the airport branch seemed to take a ridiculous amount of time dealing with each customer and walking up and down the counter. Total time in airport from arriving at gate to getting in the hire car was 3h45m - awful. Return flight, generally ok getting into airport to return car (well signposted). Security lines were long, seemed disorganised and genuinely felt that X-ray checks were rushed through and not especially thorough (liquids not scanned seperately as they are in UK, laptops and electricians left in bags, etc). We would deliberately avoid using this airport on a return visit to florida which limits airlines we could use, but I could not face another arrival like that, almost half as long as the trans Atlantic flight.

2016-07-28,5,10,"""bags never turn up together""",N Planer,"✅ Verified Review |  I visit Orlando International (MCO) quite regularly and overall it is a nice airport but it is spoiled by one long term irritation (bag collection) and a more recent one (TSA related). International Arrivals MCO’s international credentials are irritating. Having collected your bags from the carousel and then gone through customs, unless you are travelling lightly you have to give up your bags for transfer to the main terminal building only to have to retrieve them from yet another carousel. Invariably the bags never turn up together and sometimes the time for them to arrive is excessively long. This airport needs a one-stop international arrivals terminal, collect your bags once and go. Departures security on my last few visits, the TSA have spoiled the party. They seem to think that by penning people together before allowing them to pass through the scanners, they are being efficient. Wrong. All this does is succeed in annoying normally mild mannered people who see that they are being processed out of turn. The first TSA person you encounter does not even check boarding passes in correct sequence. We had about 20 people behind us when 2 females just walked to the front of the line and the guy said they are next. It is no use arguing because they are clearly selectively deaf. Do not get me wrong, there are many very pleasant TSA staff and they have a tough job but the whole TSA management structure at MCO need to be re-trained. Last week they did not have the trays ready for the scanner so told everybody to just pass through with minimal checking. Whilst it made the process quicker becuase I did not have to get my laptop out or take my shoes off, their job is to check people properly. They might feel people constantly bash them but most times they deserve it by being stupid. Orlando airport management need to have words with the TSA before they become as bad as Miami airport.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Halfway through the queue you are given the option of going through the fast track gates, depending on how recently you have visited the US. We were allowed to use them, however by the time we had gone through the process three times, then queued up to pass on our details to the Immigration Officer it probably would have been quicker to stay in the regular queue. However, overall the queue was no longer than 30 minutes. The layout of the airport is a hub and spoke design with a main terminal building and four satellite ones. Our bags arrived quickly after immigration but you then have to place them back on a conveyor belt whilst you take the monorail to the main terminal building only to have to wait to pick them up again. The queue for the hire car was nearly an hour and was very frustrating. On departure check-in was quick however the security line was long and moved very slowly. Once you are through security you have to take the tram in the opposite direction out to the satellite terminal where the range of duty free shops was very limited. There are plenty of shops in the main terminal building but these are open to anyone and therefore not duty free. Seating at the gate was very limited, there was a B747 being loaded on the gate opposite and there were hundreds of passengers standing around the gate area as all the seats were full. Overall, not a great experience but at least immigration queues seemed to have decreased.

On this occasion a couple of planes had landed within a few minutes of each other from the UK. Once through to immigration we where met by the most miserable looking staff member pointing to where the line started. (Not needed as it was obvious). This line was beyond the designated cattle grid system they use. They proudly brag that they have a new system to allow you to fast track through if you have visited the USA in the last 8 years, unfortunately access to it is only gained half way through the cattle grid queuing system. So was mainly unused for great lengths of time. When we did get to it, it didn't work so we had to join another queue to go through immigration with someone else that didn't want to work there. Although the people in front of us were less than 20 in number, it took longer than it would have done had we ignored the electronic counters and stayed in the traditional lane.

Security was a joke for opposing reasons: Arriving late afternoon - we immediately joined a 2.5 hour queue for passport control. With 3 gates open, from around 10 that could have been, we watched the staff swan around as if we had all year. With a grunt and and air of satisfaction that we had been put through this period of torture, we were directed to another 'cheerful chappy' to collect our baggage. A visit to the toilet was in order and that's another story in itself. What a mess they were in. Having loaded our bags onto a trolley and moved around 100 metres we then had to take the bags off the trolley to use escalators up to the shuttle train to the terminal building. We then headed to collect our hire car - fairly straightforward at this stage. Departing - Not the airport's fault but British Airways' IT system crashed and everything had to be completed manually at check-in. A 3 hour queue. Bad enough, we were checked in at 9.15 and our flight was scheduled to leave at 9.30 and we hadn't been through security yet. We rushed towards the long queues at security thinking that we would be hanging around for another hour (at this stage not too worried since our bags were checked in and the plane would be unlikely to leave without us and the other 20 people in the same position), not so. Bearing in mind the date and the events in Brussels we couldn't believe the way security were processing people and property - obviously under pressure to get the planes loaded and off the runway, it was, in my opinion, the most lax security checks I've seen at an international airport. Overall, this turned our journey into an arduous and stressful affair and having been in Orlando 20 years ago and seen how it is now. We definitely wont be back.
