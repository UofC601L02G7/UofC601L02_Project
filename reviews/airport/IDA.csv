For a small airport, TSA is efficient and does not do a lot of unnecessary screening just to have something to do as at other small airports. The gate crews work very hard to get you out on-time, and luggage retrieval is easy. Rental car offices are next to baggage claim, and other than Budget, are extremely helpful. There is a coffee shop upstairs, as well as a bar/restaurant; everyone is friendly here and pricing is reasonable. Two minutes from I-15. The place seems pleasantly ignorant of airport hassles that have descended upon much of the industry.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
