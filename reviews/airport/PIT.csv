2021-10-20,10,10,"""That is excellent customer service""",Sharon Walker,✅ Trip Verified | I have flown from Charlotte NC to Pittsburgh many times in the past 14 yrs. Today I lost my wallet. I was very fortunate to be called informing me someone had turned in my wallet. They kindly sent an employee up to gate B32 to return it to me just minutes before my flight took off. That is excellent customer service and I will be forever grateful for their kindness. I will never forget this. Thanks for such a wonderful and caring staff. You guys rock!,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2018-03-21,1,10,"""horrible personnel management""
",R Davids,"❎ Not Verified |  The line to go through TSA security checkpoint was literally outside into the tunnel. It took 45 minutes to get through security checkpoint alone. Considering it is 5 am on national turn your clock forward day with only a handful of flights, there must’ve been three dozen people in line complaining that they were going to miss their flight. I missed my flight, because of horrible personnel management. There were plenty of individuals standing around they could’ve very easily opened the optional check point.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2014-08-15,4,10,Pittsburgh Airport customer review,Winston Mann,"Overall PIT is a good airport. Given that it was built for much higher traffic everything is far under capacity. However the Delta flight from Paris continues to be very inconvenient and the process of arrival is designed in a very poorly thought out manner; after our first time on this flight we decided not to do it again but we broke down because there was a rare deal on this route. One would think that PIT's only flight to Europe would be outstanding. It is excellent to CDG. Upon return one goes through customs and immigration as expected but then stupidity gets inserted into the process. The mammoth design flaw is that one must recheck bags and go through security in order to LEAVE THE AIRPORT. This is standard procedure for connecting flights but not if your final destination is PIT. I have traveled numerous airports on three continents regularly and never seen anything as as poorly designed as this process. Third world countries do better. Imagine you purchased some duty free booze in CDG Paris. You cannot bring them through security and they need to be placed into your baggage. Our first time on this flight we were not told to put the liquor into our bags. Several people forfeited very expensive wine because they already checked their bags. They do a better job of warning passengers now. Additionally Delta seems to have some problems with baggage. We rechecked three bags after clearing customs for pickup at the baggage claim so we could leave the airport. One bag arrived fairly promptly about 20 minutes after checking it. The other two bags showed up more than 45 minutes after the first (so it took an hour). All were deposited on the conveyer belt at the same time. They only had to move the bags from the gate to the ""landside terminal"". Delta told me that they have three flights arriving very close together and there are only so many baggage handlers. These three flights all came in on schedule. They knew the planes and passengers would arrive - no mystery regarding the required tasks. The international arrival area was designed when security was far more lax than it is now however there are solutions. Why not run buses? European and Asian airports are always loading passengers into buses. Why not move the international gate to the ""land side terminal""? It is simply not worth the trouble to get a direct flight. We intend on driving to another airport to do international flights or simply connecting elsewhere in the U.S. to go abroad. Clearly PIT management and facilities are not competent to handle international flights.",,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
