2022-05-09,1,10,"""keep your head down and mouth shut""",M Heale,"✅ Trip Verified |  I rarely have anything negative to say about an airport as I travel frequently. I understand the airport in a small town like Omaha is small. However, when I overhear TSA agents badmouthing passengers that were just in their line to the desk agents, you know something is wrong. I guess moral of the story in Omaha, keep your head down and mouth shut.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2021-02-16,1,10,"""Absolutely terrible customer service""",Joe Critser,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely terrible customer service again with Delta! Could not locate my flight and made my employee late for his flight today, twice in one day, once at Omaha and once at Minneapolis. Both employees were there 2 hours before flight time and still didn't make their flight because of the incompetent employees at the Delta check in. Flights were rebooked at no charge because Delta was at fault but I am not reimbursed for the time lost at the job site for these two employees. Will not be using Delta again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'February 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-03-14,9,10,"""had no issues whatsoever""",Chuck Griffin,"Easy in and out airport. Decent selection of food outlets and shopping options for an airport it's size. Flew in for a day trip to visit and old friend and had no issues whatsoever. Security screening was a breeze, less than 5 minutes. Flew in and out of the B concourse.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-08-29,9,10,Omaha Airport customer review,B Clark,Small and easy airport. Plenty of food options. Extremely clean terminals and toilets. Only 9 out of 10 due to parking. Signs are a little confusing when using quick parking option...the signs do not inform if you have made it to North terminal.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
