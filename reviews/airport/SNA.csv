2021-05-26,1,10,"""priorities need to be shifted and staff re-examined""",P Allen,"✅ Trip Verified | TSA are extremely rude. To the gentleman in the tsa pre line, learn manners if you’re going to be working with customers or work in the back in a dark room away from people. If I’m asking you something, don’t have attitude when responding. I’m asking to know because I don’t know the answer, sarcasm is not needed. Also out of the 30 airports I’ve been to throughout the world this is the first to tell me my cosmetic items were too large. I think it goes without saying priorities need to be shifted and staff re-examined.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

",T Tracy,Not Verified |  John Wayne airport is a nice little small/humble airport good for traveling with kids. It is a small airport with only 22 gates everything in the airport is close by. If you live by John Wayne I definitely would recommend!,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2018-10-03,9,10,"""Large airport, small town feel""",Matthew Salovitz,✅ Trip Verified | Beautiful airport in Orange County with incredible ease to all major interstates. Airport sits off the 405 and is perfectly situated for Los Angeles visitors.

2018-03-28,1,10,"""absolutely rude and unprofessional""",E Andrews,"✅ Trip Verified | The staff here are absolutely rude and unprofessional. I arrived in a timely matter and said goodbye to my family and younger siblings who I have not seen in many years and as I walk up to baggage check in, they say I’m a few minutes too late (despite being over half and hour early) and that no exceptions could be made. They made me pay a fee for a new flight and the lady was extremely rude. This is definitely the last time I will ever fly from John Wayne and instead, will just still to LAX where they strive to please their customers.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-03-27,4,10,"""laziness and tardiness""",Carolyn M Willis,✅ Trip Verified | I landed with wheels down at 12:05 PM. I was the fifth person off the aircraft and it took till 12:50 to get my bag back. That is horrible! This airport is way too small to justify that laziness and tardiness in a frequently visited area. I am a business traveler from Atlanta and Delta has bags up in 20 min at one of the busiest airports. Get it together and build your quality!,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-04-24,9,10,"""a great airport""",J Cohen,"Never had any problems flying in and out of John Wayne/Orange County Airport. It's clean, security is quick and efficient and has that laid back atmosphere that is OC. It's very convenient - even when it comes to flying internationally you can get almost anywhere in the world with no more than one stopover. At times I'll fly out of LAX if I'm not in the mood for that stopover, but OC always offers a pleasant alternative for convenience and efficiency. Because of its curfew, a lot of planes depart first thing in the morning so getting there early is advised. But overall a great airport.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-03-28,9,10,"""security a breeze""",Dylan Peterson,Love John Wayne Airport - it is close and convenient to the I405 and everything in southern California. It is a lot easier to get in and out of than LAX and so much more modern. Flew from here to Portland recently and going through security and checking in the bags was a breeze.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-10-31,10,10,"""all about efficiency and comfort""",Anurag Dave,John Wayne Airport is all about efficiency and comfort. This airport has one of the most direct and easy access to the freeway of any airport that I have been to. I took Southwest Airlines from John Wayne to Las Vegas. Checking-in my bags at the airline counter and going through security took me no more than 20 minutes. There are plenty of open seats at this terminal and a variety of restaurants to choose from. Southwest terminal has large windows from which passengers can enjoy views of aircraft taking off and landing. John Wayne also provides free wifi.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-05-26,9,10,John Wayne Airport customer review,Colin Gorman,This is my preferred airport in SoCal for arriving at/departing from which I do on a regular basis. Big enough to offer connections anywhere in the US for flights to Europe yet small enough offer a quick friendly and efficient service to/from your gate. Drop off facilities outside the terminals needs to be improved but apart from that no real complaints.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-05-15,8,10,John Wayne Airport customer review,J Desta,The Airport is one of the easiest to get in and out of. The only problem the airport has is in planning and building a convenient location for taxi transportation. This problem did prevail when the airport was built. There was no taxi designated location. The one the taxis are situated now was an improvised one out of necessity. Once again with the addition of terminal C which is far away from the present taxi stand is too far for seniors and others. Something has to be done to improve this.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2009-06-08,4,10,John Wayne Airport customer review,S Koenig,SNA-ATL-FOR on Delta. We were staying in Ontario but flew out of SNA rather than ONT due to flight schedule and prices. It's a relatively small easy to use airport at least compared to LAX. Rental car return facilities are in the basement of the parking structure immediately across the street from the main terminal so after returning your car you just need to walk to an elevator go up a few floors and cross the main airport roadway at the arrivals level to the terminal. No need to take the shuttle bus of the individual rental company (like at LAX) or a consolidated rental car shuttle (like at ONT). Line through security was short. There seemed to be a dearth of rest rooms in the departure area and options for food were located in the food court area at the far end of the terminal from where we were leaving so we got in a fair amount of walking.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
