2010-12-01,4,10,Bloomington Airport customer review,S Hedden,Very pleasant and easy airport. Rental car lot a few steps from the exit door. Spacious airport has 9 gates but only about half are in use. Only complaint is restaurant is before security and closes their grill well before the last flights depart in the evening.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
