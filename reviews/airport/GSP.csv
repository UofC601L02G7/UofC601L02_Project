TSA took 35 minutes to get trough, such a small airport, TSA workers just standing around, talking and laughing, that's what we pay for?

2019-06-20,10,10,"""I cannot thank her enough""",C Johnson,"✅ Trip Verified | It was my first time flying with 2 rambunctious toddlers. One of my granddaughters had her own seat, the youngest would be on my lap. Long story short, l forgot to obtain a boarding pass for the 23 month old and was unable to get through the busy security checkpoint. TSA agent saw my distress, and stepped in with a wheelchair ride for the girls and escorted me back to ticketing. Had it not been for this agent I would have missed my flight. I cannot thank her enough.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2018-01-12,7,10,"""nicely maintained, with super-friendly staff""",Nick Shadoff,"✅ Trip Verified | I fly weekly for business, and flew in and out of Greenville-Spartanburg for the last quarter of 2016 and a bit of 2017. It's a small airport, with only one runway, and one long concourse with arbitrary ""A"" and ""B"" separation. The major airlines serve GSP, but flights are limited. I mostly flew on American, which only seems to connect via Charlotte - an 80 mile flight. First - being so close to a major hub like CLT caused almost weekly delays, as my flight was often held on the tarmac by CLT air-traffic control, so we could fit into the traffic pattern. I never actually missed my connections in Charlotte, but did have several walk-jogs across the airport to reach my gate while the final groups were boarding. But, GSP itself is nicely maintained, with super-friendly staff. They offered TSA PreCheck when I flew in and out. I got to know the Avis rental-car staff by name, and they'd give me free upgrades. Best of all, if you use GSP, you have to order a tuna melt from the snack counter on the lower level, outside security. They mix the tuna salad from scratch in front of you, and make the best-tasting tuna melt I've ever eaten.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-06-09,6,10,"""services are fairly basic""",Bill Holmes,"Greenville-Spartanburg (GSP) is a regional airport in northwestern South Carolina. It gets its ""international"" name from its customs clearance facility for air freight to serve the 175 foreign companies with operations in the region, it has no international passenger flight (although its 11,000 foot runway could handle them). Greenville, SC has become one of the most dynamic small cities in the US and the airport is finally upgrading to reflect this change of status. Immediate inconvenience comes from a major construction project to upgrade facilities. Boarding areas are comfortable even though services are fairly basic. Baggage claim is very convenient. Outside pick-up and drop-off areas are being improved but can be somewhat cramped at present. The biggest limitation is security, which is totally inadequate during construction and features no TSA Pre-Check.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
