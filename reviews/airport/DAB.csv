Security TSA check-in needs a remodel, non district missing information. A narrow hallway. Seating in boarding area poor. Seats torn, walls in need of ""TLC"". Entire area needs a new property manager, only nice open - clean area was the car rental area.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-09-11,10,10,"""a fantastic stress free airport""",Murat Nal,"What's not to like. Absolutely brilliant small airport. From gate to luggage pick up in 15 min. Airport very clean, ground staff all were friendly, excellent wifi, affordable food outlets and ample seating area. What I liked most were on departure the immigration staff were very chatty, wanted to know how your visit was and genuinely cared that your visit to DAB was enjoyable. All the usual car rental companies were there. I liked Hertz. I was worried that my flight with Delta landed a few minutes after midnight and they close their desks at midnight. They informed me if their system showed a pick up after midnight that they would wait for that person regardless of the time. A fantastic stress free airport.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2008-05-30,5,10,Daytona Beach Airport customer review,Paul Townsend,This airport on Florida's East Coast is a beautiful little facility! Upon deplaning I was greeted by a small but spacious and superbly appointed six-gate terminal which was quite welcoming. The terminal is remarkably well-maintained and is very user-friendly with nice short distances good signage and a few clean shops to pick up a magazine or a quick meal. The personnel (both Delta and the airport security) were some of the most courteous airport employees that I have seen in a while with an genuine eagerness to serve. The only downside to DAB is the relatively small number of airlines and flight choices; prices are often higher than Orlando or Jacksonville and you will probably have to catch a connecting flight through a major hub to get to your destination. And auto racing fans can catch a good view of Daytona International Speedway (right across the street from the airport) on landing if they are lucky.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
