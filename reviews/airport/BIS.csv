2020-02-19,5,10,"""does not have a 24-hour Terminal""",Andy Zachmeier,Not Verified |  Bismarck Airport does not have a 24-hour Terminal. The Terminal closes 1/2 an hour after last flight for the day. The terminal will not re-open until 3am. Everyone in the Terminal will be required to leave from 1/2 an hour after last flight until 3am so that required security checks can be completed. It is not allowed to spend the night in the Bismarck Airport Terminal. Please plan appropriately.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-07-09,8,10,Bismarck Airport customer review,Bret Hammell,A small but full service airport.  Doesn't have some of the amenities of larger airports but you would not expect them. Clean. Great service. Short wait times.  Highly recommended.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
