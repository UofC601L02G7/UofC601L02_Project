2024-06-23,1,10,"""TSA in this airport is incredibly rude""",Noemi Prado,"Not Verified |   The TSA in this airport is incredibly rude. I came in with a fractured ankle, and nobody was helping me. They were screaming at me. I managed to take a picture of that rude person, who wouldn't even tell me his name and covered his tag so I wouldn't catch his name. Embarrassing. I hope he and the other rude people around gets fired. This is terrible. No one deserves to be treated like that!!

2024-03-30,2,10,"""TSA yelled at and berated my daughter""",S Neale,✅ Trip Verified |  The airport itself is nice and clean but the staff were awful! I consider myself pretty easy going and let a lot of things brush over but the way my daughter and I were treated was completely uncalled for. It was myself and my 5 year old learning disabled daughter traveling home from a vacation visiting family in North Carolina. TSA yelled at and berated my daughter for struggling to follow exact instructions scaring her and made following instructions that much harder. It turned our already stressful day into a nightmare. I understand millions of people move through the airport and there are protocols that need to be followed for everyone’s safety but I can say with absolute certainty we will never fly into or out of Raleigh again. Experiencing one moody/rude person is easy to pass off as they are having a bad day but literally everyone! Staff really need to get in touch with how to treat travelers like human beings not prisoners. Chicago O’Hare TSA/staff are top notch and were so kind for our trip flying out making our experience this morning that much more shocking.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I frequently fly with small children (my 12th flight with 2 two-year-olds) and have never had a worse experience with TSA practically berating me over stroller. Most airports have you breakdown the stroller and run through machine. NOT here. If you don’t want to be harassed, do not break your stroller down.

2023-03-27,10,10,"""an exceptional airport""",Pieter Boone,"Not Verified |  Being fed up with the chaos at many ports of entry into the USA from Europe (as a non USA-citizen), I thought to try out a new way to enter the USA with less wait, hassle, stress and frustration. I flew the non-stop AA flight from LHR into RDU. Even though I was in business class and was among the first to disembark, I believe all passengers entered the USA (border control), in 15 minutes or less. It took me 3 minutes from plane door to curbside.  Also, the airport is modern and clean, really nice staff. With just one or two daily incoming flights from Europe, I don't think there is a better way to travel into the USA from Europe. I connected the next morning on a very early (5 am) departure. Staff told me there was a 'morning rush', so I was a bit nervous about TSA opening only at 4 am. Arrived at 3:30 am, and soon after that TSA started processing passengers.

And this is saying something since I have to fly out of NYC airports. The security check point is horrible. Regardless of time of day - even 5.00 am. The line is so long it spills out into the baggage drop area. And it's ALWAYS this way. The staff are so rude. They obviously enjoy harassing people. Then, should you have enough time for food or coffee, the lines are huge for these too.

Upon hearing that I was ok and figured I could just enjoy some of the restaurants and found out that every bar and restaurant closes at 8pm. I was told by an employee that when flights are delayed they are supposed to receive a memorandum that will keep the restaurants open until those flights have departed. There are too many people that pay good money to fly and there are no accommodations to keep them comfortable and entertained until their departure. I strongly recommend the hours change from 8 to 10pm for closing time. I understand these places open up at 4.30 or 5am but you still have fliers who take flights late in the evening. These little stores that stay open does not meet the demands of customers.

Twice this summer I had to experience the gridlock of cars attempting to pick up people at this terminal. There is no way to pull over to pick up people, even when they are right there waiting out front. The security officers yell at you to keep driving around, adding to traffic issues and do not give you a chance to pull over. My 80-year-old mother was stepping across several lanes of traffic to try and reach me and the security officer was yelling at both of us. I had already circled around 3 times! The poorly run arrival area looks like a COVID hotspot. If they would let you pick up passengers, there would be fewer problems. They should redirect rental car buses to another location or spread arrivals out so there are fewer people trying to be picked up at the same time. The security officers should get off of their Segways and try being helpful instead of yelling at elderly people and those picking them up.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

So, after being patted down to a degree of humiliation, she said” you can go.” There were all male TSA and male employees around. I know all this is for security.

One is for Southwest Airlines and has been recently renovated while the other houses most other airlines and was opened in 2011. In August 2016, I traveled through the airport 4 times and found the TSA security lines to run smoothly, especially for pre-check passengers. There are plenty of shopping and catering options inside the terminal once past TSA. The restrooms are clean in the departure gate area. The architecture is modern and spacious, but it already appears that the terminals are crowded at times, especially in the baggage area. One airline has the right to one baggage carousel and when several flights are arriving at once, it is a bit chaotic down here. There is a decent area for arriving passengers to be met by incoming passengers with public restrooms and a Starbucks. I have never arrived internationally, so I cannot attest to those facilities, but considering there are only 3-4 per day, it should be adequate.

Terminal 1 on the other hand is really basic. Depending on your airline RDU can be a great experience or just an average one.

2008-07-04,2,10,Raleigh-Durham Airport customer review,R Yancy,RDU is my home airport. The airport is divided between terminals A and C. Terminal A houses the majority of the airlines. However the terminal was never meant to be permanent as Terminal C used to be an American and Midway Airlines hub. As a result Terminal A is adequate but nothing special. The facilities are nice except for the Southwest and US Airways baggage claim area (it is a dump). There are enough shops to keep you occupied until your flight arrives (on the concourse level that is; the baggage claim and ticketing level which is also a waiting area for those waiting for someone to arrive has virtually nothing to entertain people). The downside is that there are no moving walkways and the terminal stretches a good distance (word of advice: if you have a flight with Northwest or Continental wear comfortable shoes as the gates are at the far end of the terminal). Terminal C on the other hand has fallen behind the times and is quite drab. Half of the terminal was torn down to be rebuilt by the end of summer of 2008. The side of the terminal currently open is pretty poor with barely any shops to entertain travelers and with much of the building seeming in disrepair. With the second phase of the construction of terminal C to be completed by 2010 or 2011 the terminal will be much nicer. There is nothing terrible about RDU but when compared to other airports it is average at best.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
