I have seen the airport grow and change over the years. The changes over the years have been for the better! Notable things about Austin-Bergstrom International (AUS): - there are two terminals the (main) Barbara Jordan terminal where all the restaurants, lounges and stores are, and the South Terminal currently Allegiant and Frontier Airlines. - there is a family viewing area outside the airport for watching planes and having a picnic. There are currently 4 lounges (AA, UA, DL and a Chase Sapphire Terrace) - there are many good places to eat including many local restaurants (my favorite are Taco Deli, Salt Lick BBQ, Second Bar + Kitchen, Annie's, and Juiceland. - it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end of the terminal to the other, along the way you will see lots of places to eat, drink and shop. Pros: clean, great dining, bars, and rest areas. The Delta lounge is the nicest lounge in the airport.

Austin airport seems to continue its decline year after year.

2019-10-11,4,10,"""a surprisingly disappointing airport""",W James,"✅ Trip Verified | Simply put, Austin Bergstrom is a surprisingly disappointing airport. Before I venture into the negatives, I do want to highlight the positives of the airport: The terminal opened in 1999, and has largely, recently been renovated. The dining options in the terminal are largely from very local, and locally-themed, restaurants, something unique to airport terminals around the world (as opposed to a local restaurant being located amongst a terminal full of chains). The airport's clean, modern and fairly spacious even given its small size. The seating areas feel more like very nice doctor's offices than the traditional airport seating arrangements. Parking is close to the terminal, even economy parking, and it's reasonably priced. Access off Highway 71 is easy, whether coming from Austin and I-35 to the west or Bastrop and Houston to the southeast. The airport doesn't feel particularly crowded, even during peak passenger traffic hours. And yet, I can't bring myself to give this airport any more than a 4/10 overall rating. I don't particularly enjoy flying out of here. For one, the signs directing drivers to parking areas, arrivals, departures, and the correct lanes for regular vehicles and buses/livery are poorly marked, in my opinion. Even chaotic airports like LAX and O'Hare have better signage for such, strangely. Secondly, once you're within the airport, signage to direct people to check-in areas, rideshare and taxi pickup areas, and security isn't exactly the clearest, not the worst I've seen, but enough to make a small airport relatively confusing. Thirdly, once you're past security, it's surprising to find that the restaurants that serve tacos, meals, margaritas, beers - the things you'd expect to find in an airport in Austin and Texas are slowing down or even closed after 8.00pm. Fourthly, the personnel that work here are very hit and miss, but generally unfriendly. For example, the ticketing agent for Spirit Airlines (not exactly the budget airline with the best reputation) was very pleasant and courteous. The TSA agent who checked my driver's license, a super friendly and chatty guy. But, the shuttle bus drivers between economy parking and the terminal were little more than manner-devoid rubes. The actual x-ray screening agents for TSA were some of the biggest smart-asses (and not the fun kind, but the unpleasant kind) that I've ever met in my life, period. The restaurant servers and bartenders don't give customers eye contact while providing service, and can often be found tapping their feet while interacting with customers and not interacting with one another at all while working. That's the part that leaves me cold; for all the talk of Texas hospitality, it is sparse in this airport. In summary, there are much worse airports in the USA, but there are also much better airports in the USA and abroad. Only fly into Austin if you must!",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I will admit a bit of bias on my part since this is my hometown, but really it's one of the best mid-size airports in the country. Terminal Signs and Directions: the airport installed interactive screens that help with way-finding. They are useable, but kind of slow. Signage is abundant throughout the main terminal. Queueing Times: In July 2015, ABIA expanded its ability to handle passengers significantly with the opening of a new passenger screening and customs facility. It's significantly easier to access the eastern part of the terminal from check-in. Terminal Cleanliness: The terminal is kept rather clean, and recycling stations are abundant throughout the terminal. The sorted system is somewhat unnecessary given the city's switch in recycling policy, but they're well-used. Terminal Facilities: There's some funky art in the terminal, and not in a good way. That being said, the airport is a sleek, modern building that can be somewhat overtaxed at times, especially around festivals, but befitting of the city. The Admirals Club leaves something to be desired. Not enough outlets. Food and Beverages: Good to excellent. Mostly local companies. The reason I take off a star is because honestly sometimes I just want some disgusting, processed fast food, and ABIA doesn't really have that. Airport Shopping: Again, mostly local companies operating stores, which limits the selection to Austin-themed merchandise, with no real duty-free. It's nice but nothing remarkable. Airport WiFi Service: Okay this is probably my biggest sticking point. The city is a high-tech hub. We're world-renowned for our technology sector. The WiFi should not be limited to ""Free for 30 minutes"". The airport has been growing for about five years straight as of writing this review, with several record-breaking years in a row. There's always something new to check out, whether it's an art exhibit or a new destination or airline being added. We've had two international carriers come in and start highly successful routes in as many years. I'm hoping the airport can keep up with the momentum.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2009-12-11,2,10,Austin Airport customer review,John Walker,"I had several trips each quarter to AUS giving me a chance to figure out how to use the airport. First give yourself lots of time to get from your starting point to the airport by car as the roads in and around Austin are terrible - badly designed and poorly maintained with tremendous volumes of traffic. Second give yourself more time if you are on the first flights of the day as the check-in and TSA security cannot handle the large volumes first thing in the day. Third prepare to have some sort of strange interaction with the TSA as they exercise their improbable variant of ""logic"". Fourth eat before you go to the airport as the options inside the ""secure"" area are plentiful but of poor quality. Otherwise once you are inside the ""sterile"" area the airport is well-designed and I see others have mentioned the good massage spot near gate 13. The bathrooms are excellent. Unfortunately you frequently need something like a stiff drink and a massage to release the tension associated with the bad roads long lines and ridiculous TSA.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-06-07,5,10,Austin Airport customer review,E Mabley,Austin Bergstrom Int'l is one of the best American regional airports. Southwest and American dominate here it can be costly to fly to/from the US west and east coasts and international service is non existent but the airport is among the most well-designed and efficient. The terminal is spacious overcrowding is seldom an issue and there are plenty of dining and shopping options. This airport should be used as a model for all new medium-size airports being planned.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-05-20,2,10,Austin Airport customer review,John Philipps,"One key to a good trip through AUS is to minimize your time within the sterile area as the activities are very limited. The restaurants within security are relatively expensive and serve very poor food especially those that purport to be airport versions of the local fare. No Starbucks. If you can avoid evening departures as this is when the live musicians play in the center area causing an already noisy airport ambience to become even worse. If you can avoid early morning flights as the TSA security theater is made worse by inadequate entrances resulting in lines that stretch the length of the terminal. For those with checked in luggage the lengthy wait times upon arrival can be problematic; however the airport restrooms are some of the best in the US. AUS has both a good heel bar and an excellent massage kiosk. The roads to the airport are very very poor and the signs are confusing at best just like the rest of the city so plan lots of extra time to get to the airport on the terrible Austin roads. The car rental facility is on site although ""customer service"" can be a problem.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-11-30,2,10,Austin Airport customer review,J Levitsky,The roads around the airport are poorly designed and constructed so it is not easy to find the airport or the rental car facility. This is also true of the rest of the Austin region so this is not unusual for the city where correct signage is at a premium. No Starbucks but lots of other local restaurants although their menus are limited. Lots of light and high ceilings but not an airport to spend lots of time at unless you like the massage spot.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-04-07,4,10,Austin Airport customer review,Bruce Roberson,Austin has free internet service Downtown but not at their airport. There is Not a Starbucks but they have a local substitute of a high blend coffee shop. I feel sorry for families traveling because there is not any kind of restaurant food that children will recognize. It would be nice too if there were more electrical outlets for laptops and phone chargers. It is kept very clean and the easy access to rental cars is a very big plus! Amy's Icecream is worth the calories.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-10-03,4,10,Austin Airport customer review,R Jones,"AUS is decidedly different from a lot of airports in that it tries to be well Austin. There's a live music stage in the center of the terminal and local businesses dominate the shopping scene. Much of that as other posters noted is annoying as you can't get a cheap snack and lines can be long. Shops are definitely ""Austin"" but needlessly expensive. The music is well hit and miss. I prefer quiet to some of that stuff! For the Starbuck's fans there's one in the terminal now. There are ""Austin-inspired"" murals above check-in. Great to have local artists but the art is rather pedestrian showing scenes of poor Hispanics. I think there's probably more to Austin than that. Getting in and out is easy although I have had long luggage waits. The roads and signage to the airport are OK but getting better. Seems like they built this airport without figuring out how to get to/from the place. No freeways to the place but supposedly they're working on it. Parking is not cheap but not expensive either by some standards. The cheapest is $7/day. Better to take the bus if you can if going away a long time. Car rental is usually easy. Taxi is easy. Blue Van may be a long wait and long drive as they drop off others. Early am flights (6:30am and earlier) are insane. Long long lines at security as all airlines seem to have flights at this time. Arriving earlier is not an option as the airline check-in counters and security don't open until around 5:30am.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-09-17,3,10,Austin Airport customer review,G Kohl,Austin airport is fine as long as you do not have to wait very long for your flight. Two good parts of the airport are the well-lit spacious feel to the building and the little masseuse station near gate 13. Otherwise the dining opportunities are very weak. If you want a Starbucks for instance forget it. If you want pale imitations of local restaurant chains you are in luck. Even more useless is an entire store a large store devoted to a local college football team souvenirs. The roads to the airport are terrible. Poorly-designed traffic flow is compounded by missing or misleading signage so visitors in rental cars give yourself plenty of time to find the airport and return your car. Customer service at the airport is not very good although not as bad as LAX or PHL obviously.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
