2024-06-15,2,10,"""airport offers zero amenities""",D Heere,✅ Trip Verified |  This airport offers zero amenities to the traveler. Probably the most boring place I have waited for a flight. Old equipment at TSA slows progress in getting screened. Few restaurants and even fewer bars. Zero lounges and almost no place to charge a device. It's definitely a miserable enough place that I would no longer consider a trip to New Mexico if it involves this airport!,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

It's 2023 and everyone needs to charge their devices. First trip to Albuquerque. Attended balloon Fiesta which brings in over 200 million. Think city could put some into upgrading airport.

2022-05-07,2,10,"""extremely disappointed in the way they handled security""",S Theale,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled security. Initially I was thrilled at the process and not separating people from their luggage like so many others. However, one of my bags got 'flagged' (ended up being for a stack of business cards) and it sat waiting to be checked for over 15 minutes. During that time I asked 4 different people about it and was brushed off with comments like 'They're sending someone over' or 'I'm sure they'll take care of it"" and they just walked off. It almost made me miss my flight and was just completely NOT okay. If they had even spoken to me and treated me like a person that mattered it would have been more palatable, but this negative experience will override any positive about this airport.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2022-04-19,5,10,"""a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements""",W Jackson,"✅ Trip Verified | ABQ is a nice concept, but one that needs some improvements. For starters: If you have TSA Pre-Check here, you're golden. Security is an efficient and friendly process. If you don't have Pre-Check, then the service, at least for a small airport, can be quite non-communicative, abrasive and slow. The pueblo-inspired architecture and interior design of the airport render it one of the most beautiful small airports in the USA, and the post-security viewing area of the runway and mountains is the sort of thing that more airports in this country need. However, it's not always easy to enjoy the design and the views when the tile and carpet flooring and seating throughout the airport are dirty and, for a lack of better words, dilapidated and outdated. Speaking of seating, there really isn't enough of it, in my opinion. The signage directing you to amenities, services and locations throughout the airport is helpful, but also outdated. The dining and shopping options are fine for a small airport, so no real complaints. Some people complain about the rental car facility being separate from the terminal and requiring a shuttle bus, but, honestly, the bus runs frequently and the ride is pretty short. Everything is easily accessible from I-25 and downtown Albuquerque. With a little modernization and polishing, ABQ has the potential be as good as new again.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

The lady at TSA said “our son couldn’t go through security without an ID”. Patently false - he flew RT to Texas the week prior.

2021-01-07,2,10,"""I have had horrid customer service""",Amy Dees,"Not Verified |  Avoid American Airlines at this airport. I have had horrid customer service in December 2020 and January 2021. I had a female ticketing agent charge me $170 for 1 overweight bag (54 lbs) because she claimed my husband's military orders were dated in March. Orders aren't posted the month you transfer ma'am. As a 17 year active duty wife, I may know a thing or two. Then said ""just because you are a military dependent doesn't mean you get free luggage"". I never in my life have experienced such horrid disrespect. On top of it I am a COVID crisis relief RN. I was blown away and have since vowed to never fly American again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I was flying American on May 21, my flight was delayed to the point that I wouldn’t make my transfer. I was bumped to the next day and the check-in lines were so incredibly long that I missed my flight the next morning and was forced to fly standby.

2018-03-01,2,10,"""TSA are almost always rude""",A Sanchez,"❎ Not Verified |  
Very rude TSA, been through many time and always felt it was very quick and easier to get through other than the airport staff. Not the airline staff, they are great. But TSA are almost always rude, barely smile and speak down to people going through. Not just my family but others around us in the line, and really there is nothing you can say. It is not necessary to always look like you are in a bad mood and don't want to be at work.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-09-10,10,10,"""convenient and reasonably priced""",C Orehek,This is my favorite airport. There is rarely a line to check in and check baggage or for security. On site airport parking is convenient and reasonably priced. After getting through security there is a wide assortment of restaurants and shops along with an aircraft observation lounge. There is an abundance of seating in the gate areas and the free airport wifi is very fast. Definitely recommend.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-05-29,2,10,"""an airport in decline""",Lorin McCleary,ABQ is a wonderful small airport however it is an airport in decline. The basic problem is lack of competition by carriers in the Albuquerque market. Southwest has significantly cut back service to/from ABQ and eliminated non stop service to a number of cities like Seattle and Portland. I addition this lack of competition reflects in much higher fares to the same cities when compared to fares from DEN. Why the airport management at ABQ is not more aggressive in attracting carriers to the Sunport is a mystery. Without more competition in the Albuquerque market to only alternative for non-stop service at reasonable prices is to fly from DEN and do the drive to the Denver airport.,,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2014-03-03,9,10,"""great regional airport""",D Graubard,Great regional airport. Good food - reflecting the unique New Mexican cuisine. From drop off through ticketing and security shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. As stated before the observation area is nice and quiet - with good views of the Monzano mountains and the active runways. Decor is South-western and very classic - with a lot of the original building that existed prior to the terminal upgrade back in the 1990s. It's not O'Hare with lots of flight options but also not the delays and crowds. Just wish there were more flights as prices can be high to various hub cities.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-01-08,2,10,"""worst airport I have visited""",Chester Carter,The worst airport I have visited. My flight arrived here as a connection that was delayed so we arrived close to midnight. Aside from janitors there was no one that worked for the airport readily available. As I attempted to sleep in the very poorly heated terminal until the next morning I was woken up by a security guard who told me that I cant sleep in the terminal and must go outside and then re-enter security in the morning. In the morning I was informed by the TSA agent that even though I was active duty military I cannot go through the pre-approval line unless I'm in uniform even though she knew that we are no longer supposed to travel in uniform.,,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2013-02-19,7,10,"""easy get away and arrival""",Mark Kemper,I have used ABQ for departure and arrival 3 or 4 times mostly at a time when I was doing business with a local company. What I appreciated most about this airport was the easy get away and arrival. The traffic was never bad and that allowed me to get my car and get out or get to the airport and on to the check in counter with little delay or problem. The facilities are not extensive and the amenities are modest. But with 25 gates it is not overwhelming. The facilities are also aesthetically quite pleasing.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-05-22,8,10,"""fast baggage claim""",T May,A shame ABQ doesn't have many flights other than Southwest because it is definitely the best airport in the Southwest. Good security fast baggage claim and no terminal transfers since they hold everything in one building which even blends into its surroundings. Food is a little pricey as well but otherwise it is harder to find a better airport.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-11-22,9,10,"""a terrific airport""",Josh Cuny,Albuquerque is a terrific airport. Parking is easy and affordable. Getting in and out is a breeze. The only down side is the wait at the TSA checkpoint can be long and slow so give yourself a couple hours before your flight leaves.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2010-07-19,4,10,"""distances are relatively short""",E Mabley,Albuquerque International Sunport is a functional medium-size US airport. There is only one terminal with 25 gates so walking distances are relatively short. The corridors are wide and ceilings are high so a bright airy feel. The airport is immaculate. The taxi and rental car shuttle rank are only about a hundred yards from the gate area exit and only steps beyond bag claim. The security queue moves relatively fast. The one negative is that food and beverage options are limited to a Quizno's a bar and grill a bakery offering mediocre sandwiches and a New Mexican restaurant offering very mediocre food.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-08-09,3,10,"""Rental cars are extremely expensive""",J Griffith,"Rental cars at this airport are extremely expensive. To save a lot of money I found that renting from an in town location even with return to the airport can easily save 40% or more. The trick is to reserve before with the in-town location take a cab to the location. The cab may cost $25 to $35 but the savings can be much greater. I rented a Hertz mid-size car for 9 days with an AAA standard discount and saved $300 compared to the airport price same rental same discount card! Another point about this airport if you're traveling economy on Delta watch out! On my trip Delta had no curb check-in for baggage and the ""self-check"" inside the terminal had a line with about 200 people. Extremely annoying even if you've ""checked-in"" by Internet beforehand.",,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2008-01-21,5,10,"""a hidden gem""",Chris Rothenberger,I always try to have plenty of lead time so I can go upstairs to the observation lounge - a hidden gem above the main food court. Free wireless internet leather sofas work tables and spectacular view of the mountains all make this a great place to find calm after security before the flight. Look for the two stairs flanking the large eagle-catcher statue. That's another thing: check out the permanent art collection located throughout the complex. NM is known for its native arts and what a more fitting place.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
