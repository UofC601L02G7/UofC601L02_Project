2018-05-22,1,10,"""the worst customer service""",Frankie Johnson,"‚ùå Not Verified |  Fort Wayne airport is so busy trying to save dollars they have created the worst customer service I've experienced in my entire life flying all over this country and several others! I will go to any other city, even if it means driving hours out of my way to avoid flying in or out of this airport. They have all their counter employees going out and helping in the loading departments and because of it they leave before the designated time and then lie right to the face of customers saying, ""No we were here until far after it was time for you to be here"". The security guards screamed at my entire family (we had children with us!) telling us we should have been there sooner, you were late."" They have done this to every professional friend we have. They just don't want to have enough staff to do the job so they fail to provide for those of us spending thousands of dollars for flights out of their airport. Well, never again!",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-06-10,2,10,"""it's highway robbery""",David Ickes,"A nice airport except for the parking charges. It's highway robbery. I was charged $84 for 5 days of parking in the Short Term Parking lot. Evidently the word ""Short Term Parking"" means a short walk to terminal and not the length of time you plan to leave your vehicle there. I would encourage everyone not to park your vehicles at the airport for any length of time. Otherwise you will be robbed by the airport. I know I will never do it again. Shame one you FWA.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
