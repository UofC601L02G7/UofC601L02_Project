We had orders barked at us and when we didn't understand something or failed to digest things said to us, we were shouted at like we were in a boot camp which I found very intimidating. I has my young son with me too. The staff are extremely unprofessional and when I said to the security worker that its also very stressful for us as passengers, she said ""I'm just doing my job"". No it's not your job to shout, intimidate and scare people. Its your job to remain calm, professional and give clear instructions. Not shout at ppl which scares them that much they're unable to digest what is being said. If I wasn't so tired & in a hurry to catch my flight I would have said way more and put her in a place. Also the girl checking passports & boarding passes screamed at me that much, her supervisor had to come and tell her to calm down. She didn't tell me what she wanted me to hand over, just shoved her hand out so I gave her passports and passes. She shouted I don't need those stop confusing everything just give me the passports. She was literally shouting at me.  They need to be trained better as I'm absolutely disgusted.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We understand everything TSA goes through and we are grateful for a team that secures our safety but that does not  give someone the right to yell at me or my wife! My wife is pregnant and they were savages about getting us through and getting a female to pat down my wife. We fly all the time and this is the ONLY time we had a TSA issue.

Which is surprising as I'm comparing it with airports in a few economically poor countries. The airport people seem disinterested in their jobs. Even minor rains are treated as major disasters, causing everyone to take shelters indefinitely. From experience, the wait times for baggage to be delivered is easily 1-2 hours more than the time for baggage delivery in countries like Japan, London,UAE, Ireland, and Italy. In fact, the fastest baggage delivery I've seen was at the Mumbai airport in India - the bags arrived before we reached the baggage claim. Coming back to IAH, international flights struggle to find a docking gate at terminal E. Terminal E is best described as a shanty at this point due to repairs/renovations that hopefully will conclude during my lifetime. We were forced to sit on tarmac for hours after a long flight. Passengers are treated like cattle - beware, if you're requesting wheelchairs, you'll probably be wheeled around the next day if you're lucky.

Long line at global entry so what is the advantage of having it? At other airports I just breeze through. Prices for food have reached levels that I’m not willing to tolerate any more. More than $15 for a prepacked old Turkey sandwich at CIBO that I in addition would have to check out myself is simply unacceptable even though I could expense it.

Seating is plentiful at the Gates. Give yourself plenty of time 2h.5 hrs minimum to make connecting flights. The distances from the gates to Immigration and Customs are very long. The terminal was very crowded however with Mobile Passport Control, we were able to breeze through Immigration.

Not nice when it is 100F outside. Or any time. They have construction going in - but it was the same a year ago and doesn't look like they are prioritizing this area. Worst i've ever experienced.

The construction around Terminal E is a complete disaster. On the positive side, staff were prompt and friendly with taking care of my wife, who needs a wheelchair to go any distance. TSA's staff, who is usually exceptionally rude at IAH, were decent this time. That's where the positives end. Signage is more confusing than ever, the tiny trains between terminals are completely inadequate. The worst part is passenger pickup. Rather than drive, we used Lyft. Getting to IAH wasn't bad. Getting picked up was a nightmare. Traffic was gridlocked as was the narrow sidewalk. No one was in charge, just airport staff randomly blowing whistles. After an hour of this nonsense and our Lyft driver unable to reach us, we slowly made our way back to the terminal and went to Terminal C to arrange pick up. A lot of other folks had the same idea but it wasn't nearly as chaotic as at the former Terminal E. It's clear no thought whatsoever has gone into compensating for construction issues.

Same with my things, removed our trays about 3 times with no clear instruction.  The security staff were so rude, unhelpful, unclear and shouldn't be working with the public with their attitudes.

We were at the pickup spot waiting for our passengers who were traveling with a small child to find us. Unfortunately they were at a different door. As we tried on the phone to find each other the parking attendants who were very unprofessional and extremely rude ordered us to drive away. I was almost insistent that we weren’t going to leave since we knew my son, daughter-in-law and their toddler daughter were with all their bags looking for us somewhere and furthermore, not knowing that there was another passenger pickup door did not want to go back in the long line of traffic that I just finished wasting my time in for the past half hour. Finally one of the attendant got so indignant I thought he was either going to get physical with me or call the police on me so we elected to drive around to the other pick up door (which we did not even know existed). When we got over to the other side the parking was just as chaotic as we looked for our family. I knew I wasn’t going to leave the terminal from there until we picked them up because that would have put us going into another 20-30 minute long line of traffic.

If there had been an emergency and an ambulance or fire truck had to get through, then forget about it. It's a serious public safety issue. Besides the ramp, there is another road full of cars that feeds into CDE, so you have multiple lanes of traffic funnelled into a bottleneck of two lanes: one lane is used officially to drop off and pick up DE passengers; the other lane meant for traffic to continue on to C terminal is used in reality to also drop off and pick up DE passengers. So both lanes become blocked. And there is no one there to direct people to move on from the two lanes. Bad for you if you have to drop off or pick up at DE. And super bad for you if you need to make it through that blockage so that you can actually get to C terminal. Houston Airport System, did you not think this through?

She then informs me she’s doing a pat-down, and she now has myself and two other ladies waiting for the same treatment. She then asks me if I have pain anywhere, I responded yes, I have pain in my back, she says again with needless aggression, I didn’t ask you about your back, I asked you if you have pain in the front (which was not what she said). She’s yelling this at me. She says I’m not patting down your back like I was somehow supposed to know what she meant! So, again I corrected myself, and I responded with no, I have no pain in my front. Then she does her pat-down but is going around my yoga pants waistband to my back and down my legs.

Honestly, this is a hard airport to like because it just seems stuck in 1989. But this is also a hard airport to truly dislike, as I've never had a particularly negative experience there. The biggest selling point for me is that I don't ever remember coming across rude or gruff personnel, even TSA during peak traffic hours. I'm sure a rude TSA or ticket agent exists at Bush, because it's a massive American airport after all, but I've thankfully never encountered them! They have a pretty cool display in (I believe) the American terminal which walks one through the evolution of Houston's space program history, nothing fancy or attention-calling, just factual with a few artifacts. There is a selection of decent bars and restaurants throughout, though not much in the way of anything Texas-specific that I can recall. Other than these things, the terminals are dirty. United's terminals are separated and disjointed. Security lines can be painfully slow if you don't have TSA Pre-Check or clear. The airport is honestly one of the dirtiest I've ever been to in the developed world - yes, I just reiterated the point! Seating is very crowed, and so are places to actually charge your phone, iPad, or Kindle. As I said, it looks like the airport hasn't been updated (or, in some cases, even cleaned) since 1989 - when George H.W. Bush, this airport's namesake, was actually president! Some parts of the airport have an indescribably strange smell that I can only describe as dank and damp. The WiFi connectivity is something I'd expect in a developing African country (or Australia, where it's also surprisingly bad). The shuttle bus system from and to economy parking lots is just chaotic and abnormally unsystematic - and illogical. Honestly, if the City of Houston could just improve the layout and dump a lot of money into modernization, Bush would honestly be an amazing airport!

Well luggage came and we heard the boarding call for our connection. We dashed to the security point. We had pre-TSA tickets but there was no pre-TSA line. TSA personnel just shrugged and told us we had to get in line. We made it through and heard our final boarding call. Our carry-ons went thru the scanner, were sitting in sight but we could not reach them. We very politely asked 2 different TSA staff just to please push our carry-ons about 3 feet where we could grab them - both shook their heads ""no"" and would not help us. So, when we could reach our stuff, we grabbed it and ran like the wind. I didn't even get my shoes on. Had to race 10 gates to get to our flight. Mind you, we are 60-something old and running through the airport is not something we need to be doing. Glad we still do some jogging or we would not have made it.

Out of the many desks available for use only two were open that particular evening and there were no other officers around.

We arrived on a surprisingly sparsely populated flight from London, a ten hour flight on which we were able to lie across three seats each - we thought we were lucky! (In retrospect, it seems other travellers have, perhaps, learned the lesson from experiencing what we were were just about to endure - and they found alternative routes). Plodding the long route to ‘Immigration’ brought us to a large hall where we were confronted with, probably, 20 modern, state-of-the-art, passport-reading, data-collection machines. It is apparent from 95% of all the passengers being directed to the snake-queue (with a cross on the machines’ print-outs) illustrate that these state-of-the-art machine were as much use as a chocolate tea pot! I estimate that there were 300 passengers in the queue (line) for immigration and only two of the immigration desks were open. 2 hours later we emerged from this inefficient, utterly farcical process, to rush on to Baggage Reclaim to retrieve our luggage for onward travel. All the carousels were stopped, little in the way of a clue which group of off-loaded bags might contain ours. 10 more minutes wasted. With just less than an hour left we rushed off to check-in our bags. Scanning the labels affixed in London we were then told that our flight to Pensacola (21:30) was ‘delayed’ until the next morning. (This is not any definition of delay with which I have been previously aware: the flight was cancelled, cynically categorise as ‘delayed’, without any regard for the inconvenience to us, United Airlines customers, or for those who were travelling to meet us.) As with others’ reviews, finding a member of staff to provide any help, reassurance or information was nigh on impossible as we passed through to this point. The staff directing us just were’t interested in our concerns at the speed of the queue/processing: indeed they said that we should complain to the immigration officer - see how we got on! We did: it’s all because of the reallocation of staff to the Mexican border, we were told. Seems to me that the technology employed to replace the immigration officers is unfit for purpose, the immigration management team are not fit for purpose. Please don’t think that this inconvenient, inconsiderate, inept system is only foisted on aliens (from outside the US) there were US citizens with us in this queue as a result of the ineffective, technologically defective equipment. In conclusion, reviews on this website of the Houston Airport’s customers seem to indicate that our flight was only 30% populated because those in the know have found another airline/hub airport to use in preference to this shambolic shower. It is fair to point out that after queuing for another 40 minutes, we spent a further 40 minutes being processed - we were provided accommodation at the local Holiday Inn and food vouchers - and a flight ticket to continue our journey the next morning. Interestingly, our onward flight was completely full - accommodating passengers who’s earlier flight had been cancelled. After this trip, we will not fly by United Airlines to George Bush Airport again.

Our flight was delayed by United Airlines due to storm in Houston. Fare enough. Instead of 3.5 hours we had about 1,5 hours, landing about 2 pm local time at HIA. We had 1 hour and a half to catch our flight to London scheduled for 16:25. Going through the whole process of passport checks, security checks and customs we realized that we have very limited time and started to worry. As we approached the last hurdle the baggage check we were told to go to a certain queue obviously for other people like us catching other flights. My friend was also doing it on the next line. I noticed they searched his bottles of Tequila that we both bought in Cancun. They were properly sealed and put back in the boxes and we were assured that this is ok to travell via Houston. I went to ask what is going on and asked kindly what is going on and that we are running late for our flight. One of the girls working as security replied to me -What is it got to do with me! At that point i thought that this was appalling to get answer like this but as we had very little time to get to the gate i decided not to get involved anymore. I few minutes later to my horror i realized that i have forgotten the bag with my two bottles. Immediately returned back and asked for it. An officer has given them back to me but they started checking them one by one the slowest possible way. In the meantime they confiscated on of the bottles from my mate although they wanted to take the other one as well. While i was waiting nervously for it to happen rep of United airlines looked at the screen and said my flight was now gone and i have no chance of getting on the plane. I desperately tried to call my wife who was at the gate but could not get through. Eventually a got my bottles and looked at the screen hoping for delay but there was nothing to confirm it. I had to run to gate E5 with my 13 old son and when we got finally there, there was a huge queue and people were still getting on board. Obviously the flight was delayed but nobody advised us on that and it was not shown on the screens. I cannot believe how unhelpful and rude were some of the people from security department and United Airlines. They kept repeating we are going to miss the flight and did not help us whatsoever.

I have been to nearly 40 to 50 airports and have to say that Houston airport is the worst one I’ve been to in my life. First of all, the connecting international flight after a 15 hour flight from Australia was scheduled only 90 minutes apart. Which means we only had 90 minutes to 1) Go through customs. 2) Go through TSA screening. 3) Retrieve all of our checked in luggage and take it on a 20 minute walk across the airport and send it through the scanner. 4) Go through security Again with our carry ons. 5) And finally get to our gate which was another 20 minutes away. We had 2 little kids with us and every time we asked the security staff to let us cut the lines because we will miss our connecting flight. The answer was the same: we will make sure we get you to your gate on time. Well. Guess what happened? We missed our flight. We were stuck at this horrible airport for an additional 6 hours because appearently United Airlines closed their gates 10 minutes prior to departure even though they’re missing passengers and the security staff kept telling us to not pay any attention to the boarding time but the departure time is what we should aim for. Completely dumb and uninformed. At this point the gave us the boarding passes for our next flight which was on the other side of the airport. And we had to walk to the customer service to get those boarding passes which was at the other end of the terminal we were at. The worst thing was that the gate was changed one hour prior to boarding to a completely different terminal. We had to walk for another 25 minutes carrying our kids who at this point had not had any sleep in 30 hours and every time we asked an employee with a cart (people mover) to help take us to the gate, they kept coming up with some excuse to not take us by what seemed out of complete lazyness. I found 2 carts parked and attempted to drive one myself but it had a pad with a code on it to start it. So. Back to the walking we went. Rest areas are non existent.

This was the terminal of the future. The design was very modern and clean. Blue LED mood lighting filled up the whole terminal much like the one in the 787 Dreamliner. The terminal is huge with very high ceilings. The restrooms were like I was in a five-star hotel - very modern and clean and big. There was a nice selection of food and beverages to choose from. The restaurants were not your typical Mcdonalds (no McDonalds at IAH anymore though) or Subway restaurants rather they were the specialty, high-quality local restaurants that made it all the more special. There was also a decent amount of shops to choose from though I felt there too many selling the same things: souveniers, neck pillows, and magazines. What really got the kick out of my Terminal C North experience was the seating.

We received help from the airport staff who assist passengers with needs such as with the wheelchair (but you must book the wheelchair or other assistance with your airline).

The airport is very modern but there is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) distance from Terminal A to Terminal D.and so you definitely need to take the upstairs Skytrain between terminals. There are some curvy corridors when navigating from arrival lounges, shops and the Skytrain but there are plenty of signs that point the way towards the Skytrain and other terminals. Note. For international to domestic transits you really need to allow 3 hours in case of queues and flight delays but it can be done within 2 hours if you are organised and only have carry on luggage and study the online airport maps to get an idea of where the Skytrain is located.

An airport to best be avoided. If you do use it for transit, be sure to talk with the crew of the incoming flight. They may be able to help speed things up. Otherwise it seems you need to allow at least three hours transit time. There is no transit area, so you must clear immigration. There is an automated system, but it rejects most people and you go into another queue for manual processing. When I was there, there were 3 immigration counters operating. It took about two hours with no possibility of sitting, eating, or going to the toilet. Staff were uncommunicative and only sometimes apologetic. Once out of immigration you must collect your bags and find where to drop them again. It seems easier if you are travelling United or Star Alliance. It's a longish walk to the departure part of Terminal D. After leaving your bags, you must go through security to get to the departure gate. It is extremely thorough. Because I missed my connection and was coming next day the line was short. There are no signs about the rules, but they include: Remove everything from pockets, remove laptop from bag, empty water bottle, remove shoes and belt. You get scanned in a machine, wiped with explosive test, then patted down. I forgot to empty my water bottle. If I wanted to keep the bottle, the only choice was to exit and repeat the whole process. Did so as I had time and no queue. Everything was repeated including patting down. In the gate area there is good fast free wifi.

Checking in for our flight to DXB was an hour's wait, and immigration on the way back was another hour. There are no TSA Pre or sufficient number of security counters, which means lines for security can take up to 30 minutes. The immigration kiosks for US passports are a gigantic waste of time, it takes a family of 4 at least 5 minutes (if they're quick) to scan each passport and take pictures. They probably need to triple the number of kiosks if the lines are to get any shorter. Baggage handling was an absolute mess, passengers had to go hunt for bags, which sometimes came on a carousel different from the one indicated for our flight. After you collect your bags, customs is another 20 minute line. The entire ordeal from gate to exit took over 2 hours. All in all IAH is the most embarrassing welcome for visitors to our country, and the worst possible way for Americans to return home.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

You then proceed to hand this to an Immigration Officer, and exit to recheck your Bags for your onward flight. The Kiosk throws everyone for a loop, and it was so crowded, the lines were all the way out of the hall, on Jan 4, a Monday. After that fiasco, you then encounter another 3 ring circus that makes most developing countries look like a Swiss Bank. The area to get thru security is too small, so you can not even go up the escalator, to the Security area, they had to stop the escalator, and wait for the security to clear out. Are you kidding me, a new airport, can't handle the passengers coming from Immigration? Then, after you finally get thru security, you need to take a train, as IAH is huge.

When I looked closely, some of the reports seemed to include incorrect or misleading information. To address these, the international terminal has plenty of food choices, with a variety of cuisine, the duty free is no bargain but that's typical of virtually all US or foreign airports I've visited in the last 20 years, and carts only cost once you get past customs, which is true of every US airport. There is no charge for carts in customs. As for going through security after customs, this is hardly the only U.S. airport with that feature. My only annoyance was that security didn't have a line for TSA pre-cleared passengers. Like most airports, the wait for immigration depends on how many flights arrive at about the same time. Mine was the 3rd of 4 with similar arrival times and I expected the worst, however, the long serpentine line went quickly. The immigration line took me about 45 minutes and was shorter for those who were US citizens with no declarations of food, etc. Customs went very quickly even though there were only 4 lines. The TSA folks at security were no more less difficult than most other airports. The whole process, including security took about an hour and 15 minutes. My usual rule of thumb is to allow 2 1/2 hours or more for immigration. etc. at an airport where I don't know the drill, so I was not hurried at all. Is suspect my previous trips here were up memorable because it probably went pretty much like this recent trip. The airport didn't seem particularly dirty and although the layout is confusing with sometimes inconsistent signage (the path from E to C sometimes omits reference to C), the airport itself is quite modern. It has been redone in the last decade and used to be a real 1970s relic. The food choices, overall, are much better than some other hub airports such as LAX, DFW, or ATL and it is possible to find something healthy, as well as some things that are novel. The seating is pretty standard as airports go. The wifi works well and is free, and there were multiple charging stations at my departure gates.

I was at the US citizens line and I was directed to the US Permanent Residence line where they require additional screening according to IAH policy.

I will avoid this airport at all costs in the future.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-07-06,2,10,Houston IAH customer review,Pierpaolo Messaggio,"I was in transit a few days ago. Arriving from GDL (Mexico) and continuing for NRT (Japan). The airplane landed 20 minutes ahead of schedule but we had to wait on board for 30 min because the ""gate was not available"" 2 hours and 40 minutes were just enough for me to rush and run to catch the connecting flight. First the immigration check. The queue was quite ordered and regulated by members of the staff, there were about 500-800 people in queue with just a few (about 7) lanes open. There is no fast lane for tight connections or for transit. Some of the officers were taking their own time chatting and laughing to each other while performing their duties. Baggage delivery. Even if my luggage was already tagged to the final destination I had to collect my luggage, queue for the customs clearance and go to the baggage check in counter. Security check. After all of this there is the security check. Despite the long queue and the thorough inspection, it was very well organised and extremely efficient. After the inspection I literally had to run to the gate where the connecting flight was about to close.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-07-02,1,10,Houston IAH customer review,Candice Metcalf,"We had to come through customs after vacationing in Belize. It took two hours to get through customs. I couldn't believe how inefficiently it was run. The majority of personnel, were some of the rudest my spouse and I have encountered at any airport. Particularly in baggage inspection. Horrible experience.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-06-18,3,10,Houston IAH customer review,Ken Mize,Flew into Houston George Bush Int. Airport for a job interview. Airport layout was very confusing to me. It looked to me as if they took parts of other airports and combined them to make this airport. Some areas very dirty and could not find anyone to guide me to the hotel shuttle pick up area. Hope any future travel to Houston does not lead to this airport though I've heard Houston Hobby is worse.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'February 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
