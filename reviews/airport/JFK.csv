My flight was to Seattle on July 1, afternoon, ~4:00pm. I checked-in online before I headed to JFK Airpot and so I did not have too much time before departure time. In security check point, the officer told me that, the birth date in my ticket (My son booked the ticket for me. It is his/our fault, I know.) is not the same as that in my driver license. So he asked me to go back to the check-in point for correction. The waiting line in the check-in (Maybe most of them are for checking in baggages while I do not have.) that day is super long. If I lined up from the end, I probably I will miss the flight. So, I talked to staff around the check-in area. It was so crowded. Someone said, you go to there, pointing. Totally, I talked to 5 difference people around that area. Still no one is responsible for my issue. They were saying differently. It seems I have to line up from the end. In the end, I stick on one lady. She said, I understand your situation. I can do nothing about it. She hinted me I have to line up again. Finally, I have to cut into the line by some people's kindness to allow me to cut into the middle of the line. I am OK to line up, even it is long, if I did not check in online. I would leave more time to do that. My question is. For this kind of special situation, should Delta Airline have some specific rules to handle??? would you like the custom to miss their flight?

Our bags were on the line within a few minutes too and we were through the whole immigration process and out to the taxis very quickly and smoothly. Our departure experience was equally smooth. We had arrived very early due to transfer arrangements from our cruise and had to hang around for a couple of hours for the check-in desks to open. The area around the desks is quite sterile and functional and only one shop, on the lower arrivals level was available. Luckily it did sell snacks, and drinks as the one food outlet down there was closed. Once open the check-in and security process was very straightforward. T7 now has scanners where there is no requirement to take items out of your bag so that was very smooth, delayed only by the usual one or two who left items in their pockets, forgot to take jackets off and so forth.

I even looked into the sleep pods and mentioned this as a question. The peach of a worker replied “this isn’t a lodge.” Sorry, but my costly flights help pay for him to have a job. A little courtesy and kind explanation would go a long way. Then when I could finally go through security I noticed pure rudeness and power tripping.

Had a 3 hour layover from Paris and ended up having to run to re-check our baggage and catch our connecting flight because we spent over two hours in this particular layer of hell. The staff act like they’re having one long temper tantrum after another. Sure I get that they probably deal with a lot of difficult people, but the goal should be to deescalate and not escalate situations. Especially routine ones, like traveler confusion and slow lines. The lady “helping” people get their stuff onto the belt was yelling, snapping at people and barking out orders that made no sense. She was holding onto bins as if she were trying to actually make it more difficult for people. Kept barking for people to “move it along”. I have reduced mobility and I told her it’s very hard for me to move fast without my proper footwear (which they made me remove). She actually bellowed at me that she wasn’t taking to me, she was talking to the person behind me. Zero empathy, complete nastiness. You could tell she was burnt out and over it. TSA should seriously have some sort of plan to rotate out employees who hit the wall and can no longer function on any given day. The lady who ended up physically checking my bag could barely articulate in English and I’m pretty sure it was her native language, as it is mine. She confiscated some of my food and when I asked she said it was because it was a “sprayyyyyyeee”. Took me three tries to realize she was trying to say “a spread”. The whole experience was so nasty my daughter actually burst into tears. Ironically, my partner got through with his own “spraee”/spread—they only confiscated mine. Making me wonder if this is all really just theater. Either way, this experience does not need to be made so horrid. The agents are awful but it makes me wonder what kind of support (if any) they’re getting from on high. To those people I say this—like it or not, TSA are ambassadors of the cities they work in.

If they had guided through an area of the airport that was still contained within the airport we would not have had to repeat screening, as we had already been screened at our last airport. The line for screening moved extremely slowly, perhaps due to being understaffed? Several of us were concerned about missing connecting flights, I almost missed mine despite having a 2 hour layover.

Airports all over the world have different rules for security screening. Frequent flyers will often automatically go to the majority format, it’s not malicious and it definitely doesn’t deserve being made to be the focus of derision. The gate staff called people holding a mobile boarding pass to have their ID verified AGAIN at the gate, before the boarding process started. When asked why, rather than tell the truth, they said that’s the rules. It wasn’t the rule when flying out of JFK literally a couple of weeks ago and it still is not the rule. Mobile boarding pass holders do not require additional ID screening at the gate and this member of staff was not accurate. The process for ID verification is stated as follows: “The officer will insert each photo ID into the CAT unit where the ID is scanned and analyzed.

2023-07-14,2,10,"""worst connecting flight experience""",Vanessa Lella,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst connecting flight experience I've ever encountered. We needed to collect our bags and go through border patrol/re-check bags/security. This in itself wouldn't be a problem if the airport was sufficiently manned and the process wasn't so slow. We landed into JFK at 5.45pm, our connecting flight was at 8.05pm. When coming off the plane we followed the signs for non USA citizens and stood queuing for 45 mins for passport control. It was only when we got near the front of the queue we realised there is a 'quick connect' queue for people on connecting flights. This isn't visible or well signposted until you are at the front of the queue, there were no staff directing. You would have to walk passed the 'Non USA Citizens' queue to see it. Even once we switched to that queue (as the other had stagnated completely) it still took an additional 30 mins. There was one border officer who had to take prints and pictures of every passenger. It wasn't something that can be done quickly and I understand why, however more staff would help. Once through there our bag collection was quick and easy, so that was a positive.  From there we followed signs for connecting passengers. We re-checked the bags which was quick for us. We headed for security, there is a specific security for connecting passengers. The queue was long but not overly long, the issue was again how slow it was. They had one belt open for all connecting flights. After 30 mins of queuing here, our family and others made it known to airport staff that due to the length of time queuing we were going to miss our flight. We had 30 mins until take off, others had even less. A lady who tried to be helpful took us to the front and asked security staff if we could go through as a priority as we were going to miss our flights, unfortunately she was told no. There was a belt for 'TSA' passengers that was empty, they were unwilling to let people use it despite the lady pleading with them on our behalf. I'd like to thank her, I don't know her name but she tried to help and got a hard time from others because of it. Another worker would let parties of 2 jump to the front but not us as we were a party of 4. It was so frustrating being refused help yourself to have others jump in front, making us more likely to miss our flight. After 45 mins of some passengers pleading for priority to get through and one young woman crying her eyes out because she was missing her plane, they decided opening a second belt was a good idea. After a 1 hour queue at security, we got through with 10 mins to go. We sprinted shoeless through the airport to our gate, the airport is huge so it was quite a way. We made it just in time. The icing on the cake was when we arrived at our final destination and all 4 of our bags had been left in New York. The only saving grace was that we did make our flight, despite it being an unnecessarily stressful situation. My advice is, if possible don't connect here. If you do, make sure you have 3 hours minimum to do it in case the service is as bad as it was for us.

However, the woman urged him to hurry, and he proceeded to push the wheelchair, cutting through the security line in a couple of places to get to the security check. This is where we had a very troubling experience, The young woman on security started yelling at the agent who was pushing the wheelchair, telling him to empty his pockets. He told her he didn't have anything in his pockets, She kept yelling at him, and went on about how this happens every time. Then she started yelling at my husband to empty his pockets, to take the kleenex out of his pocket, etc. Other people were also going through security, and she's yelling at us, and there are no bins to put our things in, and our possessions are being thrown on the conveyer, some on the conveyer, some in different bins, some on the floor. It was total bedlam. This woman should not be working there. She was totally unprofessional, extremely disrespectful, and it was totally uncalled for.

I laid myself down on the floor then I heard the voice saying that I was not allowed to ‘lie down on the floor.’ It was around 2am. So I woke up, and packed myself when the voice came up to me again to make sure. I moved on, looking for a bathroom and the voice called me again. She stopped me and asked where I was going. I said bathroom. She said that’s okay and told me direction to the bathroom, which was literally in front of me. She added that the Food Court was closed if I were to go there. First, I was not, and second, I knew it was closed anyway, but I did not bother to answer. After the bathroom, I started to looking for a new spot to sit down. Then I just thought that I might have a short breeze near the exit, but the door was closed. I waved my hand under the sensor once or twice then quit, and was about to resume my search for the chair. Then she ran up again and said the terminal was closed. I said I could see that, and asked her if she was following me. She said I was not allowed to roam around  the airport because the terminal was closed. But there were other people in the terminal! I said I was on my way to find a seat. She said I could sit anywhere, and I said I was on my way to the seat closer to my airline. She then said that I had to leave the terminal because my flight was to leave ‘tomorrow.’ It was 2:20am and my flight was 1pm, on the same day. She told me to leave immediately or she would call the police - she said it more than 5 times. I asked her what I was supposed to do, and she said I should leave immediately and come back after 6am. She blocking me with her body in case I go anywhere when I was not even moving. I hopped in the elevator as she said. I could see her calling someone with her wireless set to make sure I do not stay in the building. I landed on the 1st floor, with shock, horror and confusion. I tried to look up any hotels around the airport to go, but it took less than 30 seconds until the man, who got her call came up to me. He kindly advised me that the terminal 8 is open 24 hours. I asked him the direction, when she ran down to the first floor, cutting his words. She said “No, she’s not going to the third floor. Go out right here and walk across the street.” I said I would check with internet and she kept repeating that she would call the police. When I was waiting for the red light to change to green in front of the cross, I could see her watching me until I cross the street fully from inside. That was very creepy. It was 2:25am. Anyhow, I made it to the terminal 8, and guess what? There are so many people sleeping on the floor! Am I not allowed to come to the airport too early?

I boarded my flight from terminal 8 of JFK where I arrived 3 and half hours before flight. The airport was terribly overcrowded. Where in the world domestic and international passengers are checking in at same kiosks? A handful of highly uncooperative staff was available to help herd! of passengers at self-check-in kiosks so, I could not get any help in spite of literally begging from 3 staff when I was not able to scan my wife passport. Finally, one staff told me to go another counter. After standing in Queue for half an hour I was told that I was at wrong counter and should go to other counter. After standing in queue at that counter for 15 minutes, I was told that I should fill the immigration form of Peru by scanning QR code from the machine installed at a point in airport. I and at least 10 of other passengers were struggling to connect to Wi-Fi of airport to scan the code. When I went to some staff to report this issue their straight answer was “this issue is not their problem” and when I said that I will miss my flight, unfortunately instead of having a word of sympathy the answer was “it’s not their problem”. Anyways, I kept on trying for next half an hour to finally connect Wi-Fi of airport to find that it was not the “immigration form” it was “health declaration form” which I had already filled. Airport staff should at least know the exact terminology and difference between immigration form and health declaration form. Anyways, finally I stand in a long queue to find that I was not the only one, majority of the people in that line who like me were about to miss their flight or had already missed their flight in spite of reaching 3 hours prior due to utter chaos, incoordination and red tapism. I requested at least 3 staff to consider me early but in vain. Finally, I reached at check in counter to find that there was 1 pound extra in one bag (while other 3 bags were short of 30 pounds) but still the lady asked us to open our lock and shift our load to another bag. While we were doing so, she went for short break. The misery didn’t end here, security staff opened the bag of my wife to remove creams, lotions etc. (which we were open and were sure less than 100 ml; moreover, we had crossed 3 airports before in other countries with the same stuff). When I requested them to please do it little fast otherwise I will miss my flight, their answer was again “that’s not their problem” Finally, we sprinted to reach our flight departure gate which was about to close in next 5-10 minutes. At gate I was told that my cabin baggage is oversized (the same bag approved by check in staff became oversize after reaching at departure gate!). Anyways, finally we boarded our flight after depleting all adrenaline and other stress hormones. My request from authorities is:  At least separate domestic and international departures. Increase staff to help passengers at web check in kiosks. Ask staff to be compassionate towards passengers. Just bluntly saying that it not their problem does not solve the problem rather disheartens you. Start feedback system of international passengers to understand their agonies.

The luggage was off loaded from the aircraft and placed on baggage claim while we waited in line 2 hours to re-enter border passport control where only 5-6 agents were processing over 500 passengers, the employees handling the crowd could barely speak English and were extremely rude and unprofessional. Some airport employee placed our baggage at a transfer kiosk and left it sitting there unattended. There was an airport employee standing at a door doing nothing so we asked her why our luggage was just sitting there so long and she said someone would be there so we waited up to 30 minutes. The bags were sitting there for hours unattended because nobody would come and handle our bags and put them in a secure staging area for our connecting flight. We tried asking why and employees would just turn their backs and ignore us. We decided to take matters into our own hands and recheck our baggage at Delta Airlines Ticket counter. We just walked away from there with our bags and nobody said anything so there was “unaccounted for” bags now. After taking a tram and going up and down stairs to 3 different terminals we found an employee that placed our bags onto the incoming baggage belt where we hoped it would find its way to Washington DCA. We then took more trams to a shuttle bus which took us to another terminal where we went thru an absolute chaotic security without any instruction people were yelling pushing and shoving running and our Delta flight gate changed 3 times and was 2 hours late departing. Delta was late on our first flight and lost our bags at JFK and we got them 2 days later overseas while on vacation.

It took us 2 hours to get through check in and security (travelling with 5 of us, 3 children), and we missed our flight by 5 min! When we were going through security the rude arrogant lady opened every single present my children received for Christmas, opening up the toys with a screwdriver. They do this for phones, iPads, Nintendo switch! Why would they do it for a Harry Potter wand and a Star Wars droid, that I wouldn’t be surprised if it even works now, never been used! Why can’t the X-ray scanner see if there is anything inside it like all other luggage! My son was upset seeing her pull apart his droid which seemed to spur her on in her arrogance and self importance! My daughter who wears an arm brace for her recently operated on elbow gets patted down at each airport, not at JFK, they seem to think 3 different people should pat her down, then they stood there and argued about who is more important and who should’ve done it first! The arrogant self important lady who took a screwdriver to my sons toy, was more upset that she didn’t get to do the pat down than anything, taking pleasure in not only treating us and anyone around her with disrespect and contempt, but the staff that she works with as well! It took us 48min alone to just get through security. I respect the process, but it doesn’t need to be this unpleasant! After all of this the morons at security let through my sons medication which was 250ml of liquid and a pair of scissors (but thank goodness his Harry Potter wand was scrutinised for hidden things). I only know they let these things through because after missing our flight boarding (the plane was still there and the ramp just shut) we went to LeGuardia airport to wait with 3 children for 5 hours on standby and their security picked them up!

2019-07-30,4,10,"""terminal to terminal is a hassle""",Matthew Carriuolo,"✅ Trip Verified |  I arrived at JFK from Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight in May 2019, used it for both arrival and departure on JetBlue in June 2019, and then used it for transit from a JetBlue flight to a Philippine Airlines flight in July 2019. Sure, you can get to this airport from seemingly anywhere around the world, and it services the exciting city of New York. The TSA agents typically are surprisingly decent too. And check-in staff are usually pretty nice. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the extent of the positives about this airport. Upon arrival in Terminal 1, I was greeted by a customs and immigration facility that appeared to be under construction. It looked awful - all torn up! A passport control officer was basically just waving all of us in the U.S. Citizens line through while wishing us a good one. It seemed to take a really long time for luggage to arrive on the carousel. I don't mean my luggage personally. I mean anyone's luggage! Meanwhile, staff informed my parents (who were picking me up there) that everyone from our flight had already exited customs - when none of us had yet! My first flight into JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight out of JFK on JetBlue was delayed. My flight back to JFK on JetBlue was delayed. I think the only reason my flight back to Manila on Philippine Airlines was NOT delayed was that it took off at 3:45 A.M., when no one else was flying out of the airport! Transiting from terminal to terminal is a hassle, too. It requires exiting your first terminal, walking down a seemingly endless hallway to the AirTrain, taking the AirTrain to your second terminal's stop, and then walking down another seemingly endless hallway to that terminal proper. Then, of course, because you're coming in from outside the secure area, you have to go through security all over again! As for food and beverage outlets, most appear to range from relatively expensive to borderline price gouging. One very notable exception was the Dunkin' Donuts landside in Terminal 1. It appears to be the only dining option available 24 hours, and so it was the only place I could use my $20 meal voucher landside, since my flight departed in the middle of the night. At Dunkin' Donuts, I was informed that if I was going to use my meal voucher, then I had to spend at least $20. I was astonished! I struggled to manage to buy $20 worth of food and drink there. I made myself sick. I still do not understand why they would not accept the voucher for a smaller amount. It's not like they would be losing money on the deal! Add to all of this restrooms which are often not very clean and with sensors which automatically turn on sink faucets when you're nowhere near them (but don't turn on when you are near them). Finally, there's the issue of the airport's being quite far from Manhattan. I've heard LaGuardia and Newark are even worse.

YOU have to travel sometimes, does the experience of coming across someone with your attitude make you happy? Of course it doesn't. On Monday evening, all us travellers waiting to have our bags scanned were herded in to an area and made to wait. Huge unnecessary queues. How many x-ray scanners were available? Two. And they would let 4 or 5 people through at a time to the underworked customs staff. And not a smile anywhere. Thankfully I had Priority boarding which meant I could get through relatively quickly (about half an hour). I didn't bother with the priority boarding at the actual gate as the staff were clearly uninterested in this. If I ever have the misfortune of going through JFK again, I will make sure to be there at least 4 hours before the plane leaves. Coming through was relatively easy thanks to the ESTA process but getting shouted at by certain staff was amusing. Again, something to tell you: we love coming to visit but have no intention of wanting to stay in your lovely country illegally. Really, I like where I live. So, Florida next year.

If it weren’t for the competitive international fares I’m able to acquire due to routing through this airport, I’d never come. My plane landed at 4:30a, closing out an all-night flight of 11-1/2 hours. We were first to Passport Control, but other flights also arrived and discharged their passengers. There were hundreds in line, and only one agent was checking in the sea of American citizens returning home. Airport staff barked directions at incoming passengers, but with no clarity or organization or apparent purpose, generating even more confusion and frustration. My husband and I were near the front of the line; still, it was an hour before our passports were cleared. Exiting Control we followed signs for Connecting Flights. The main Connecting lobby was closed, so someone shouted from the top of the escalator to come upstairs. Once there we had the “pleasure” of joining all the Departing Passengers - both those Connecting (like us) and those just starting their trips. We stood in long Security lines, were yelled at by TSA staff or rudely ignored, and ultimately had three of our five parcels inspected/rifled. The airline staff has been courteous and helpful and genuinely concerned with passenger comfort and safety. The JFK airport staff, however, is the complete antithesis. How embarrassing for all of us, knowing that millions receive this sorry treatment. Get your act together, NY. Future passengers, be warned. Maybe your experience will be a good one. Or maybe you, too will take away the degrading experience that was mine today.

I was stood in a customs queue that wound on forever until I got panicky my connecting flight was in 40 mins. I stepped out to inform them and they told me to ‘go over there’. I wander over to a desk and a rude lady asks what I’m doing and I need to scan my passport first - well sorry the man did not tell me that! Wouldn’t it be helpful to tell me? They start whispering in another language and exchanging looks as if this isn’t an airport where new people enter every single day. I’m not thick thanks. Then comes the icing on the cake - the ever so fun customs lady who dragged her feet over to man 1 of 2 customs desks. She tells me she needs to sit down first and takes as long as possible with an attitude. Sorry I know the job is stressful but suck it up lady. Then she starts getting really intimidating telling me I’m not stood near the camera enough and I’m telling her sorry I’m flustered as I need to catch my flight. She seems totally unsympathetic and continues being rude. Sorry but I just got off a 7 hour flight from Manchester and I had 30 mins to get through security and to the gate - excuse me if I’m a little disoriented by your awful airport!

JFK is ridiculously expensive - it's literally like management went round with a clipboard and said how can we screw our customers for every fine and give them the least in return. The food we had from the noodle bar was atrocious - $46 for soup and a couple of scoops of curry. Avoid purchasing food at this airport or anything for that matter. Clearly being run by accountants with no vision for experience and repeat customers. Rude disenfranchised staff. Poor unintuitive experience for travellers. Signage is very poor with just shops and dining wrote on the signs above walk ways instead of which shops etc. This means customers have to walk all over this place and it's a lottery if you have gone the right way to find what you're looking for i.e type of restauarant or shop.

Kids were crying, people were sat on the floor, an old couple constantly appealed to the one security guard as to why more gates were not open, only to be stared at with no response. Rude beyond belief. The heat was awful, there must have been 600 or more people queuing. After 3 hours one more gate was open so the queue started to flow a little quicker, but again, by now people were becoming fractious. Another two plane loads arrive making the heat unbearable and space at a minimum. There were no chairs to sit or places to buy water. Eventually at 9 oclock, 4.5 hours later we got through the immigration queue. I cannot describe what an ordeal it was. The staff were rude, unresponsive, gave no explanation or apology for the interminable wait, and cared not for the distress suffered by the young and old. We arrived at our hotel at 11 at night.

Many TSA and border agents are rude and untactful, and if they're not, it's just plain disorganization, but on my last trip, the immigration staff managed to be rude and insulting both flying out and back (in transit). The first time, my wife, who has two passports, was unsure as to which passport to use. I won't go into details, but it was in complete good faith, but still an immigration officer told her arrogantly that she was ""playing with identities"" and to me, when I tried to explain the reasons, he asked aggressively how much I knew about migration law. Then, on the way back, another officer, having learned that we live in the DR, absentmindedly said ""and I thought this was a bad place"", right out of thin air.

There is no terminal at JFK without its flaws. Departures at Terminal One is somewhat decent, but the arrivals there is by far the worst. Terminal Four is a disgusting mess, and the rest are all horrible as well. To start, the staff at JFK are some of the rudest people I have ever met in my life. Just walking through the terminal you get looks from them, when you ask for help they're condescending, they bark orders at you instead of using a basic human being's tone. The airport is also disgusting. The bathrooms are not clean, some of the seats in the terminal or at gates will be wet or sticky, it's truly disgusting. The airport is also very confusing, gates are not clearly marked, nor where to find them. There are very few boards throughout the terminal. All staff at restaurants or food concessions are rude, or mess up your order, or are clueless. Flights at JFK are frequently delayed, and planes take forever to get to the gate which I can't seem to find a reason as to why that would be the airline's fault. The wifi at the airport also doesn't work at all, and better yet they don't seem to get any kind of cell service there (I've jumped around carriers and have always had the same issue). The security at the airport is a whole other animal. These people assume every person in line is guilty and will not hesitate to yell at you. The people at customs as well love to harass. The lounges at JFK also seem to be lacking.

My recent trip through terminal 8 was no exception. True, the TSA staff often do not exude charm but they keep the lines moving through the security machines. On departure, I used the Admirals lounge - it offers nice views of the taxiways through large windows and a good selection of hard and soft drinks. More attention needs to be given to keep the food areas tidy, but more importantly, ensure the food trays have food on them!

The “Passport & Immigrantion” touch screens are temperamental and require multiple attempts to advance in order to procure the coveted ‘receipt’. One beleaguered red-coated employee said this was the ‘new normal’ as staffing was insufficient. That is clearly part of the problem, but the whole ‘process’ is highly problematic. We waited well over an hour to pass through and nearly missed our connection — with many others waiting much longer. And as we all stood there like cattle, it was impossible to get WiFi.

The red jacketed attendant stupidly replied to me that this was a better system, that the signs for USCitizens did not mean anything, and that no one was superior with this system. This insulted me for several reasons. 1) All foreign destinations have lines for citizens and another line for non-citizens. The citizens lines tend to move rapidly. 2) I am a Vietnam Vet, a US Citizen, a taxpayer and feel we should have priority entering our own country.

We were told we were TSA Approved and it was on our pass for boarding - we were told to tell the staff member which we did. It seemed to make them want to search for a problem even more. They ridiculed my plastic boots given to all passengers in Madrid to keep their feet or socks clean when they remove shoes, and they were so rude and told me it was not acceptable after I had cleared the machine - shoes removed because of big heals. There was zero in my tiny case other than clothes but they held it back and kept it for so long another passenger intervened and told them to give it to me, and they had just left it sitting behind the the x ray box and had not done anything with it after the screening there! They then proceeded to try to close it and were catching the clothes in the zipper which seemed to amuse the man doing it. We asked for it back to close ourselves, before something was torn. This is about the third trip through this airport and we will never return to the airports [or city]. The flight to Seattle from Virgin was delayed three times and the the third time it was then backtracked upon and we were told - by a soft human voice and no inter-com it was ""going right now"". By then many people had walked right away from the gate to fill the three hours projected wait from the last delay: somewhere other than the boring gate area. People crowded around frantic to get on, and there was only an elderly staff member half directing who was boarding in a quiet voice with no inter-com. It was a total gong show, unbelievable. No cabin staff around other than at the door, and suitcases being stuffed into bins overhead where half would literally not fit!

The second scanner was successful on the second attempt. It was all done in a horrible uncaring manner and I have to say I was beginning to regret traveling to New York at all. The immigration official was so miserable and rude I felt I was totally not welcome in the country. When leaving New York it was even worse. I was in a wheelchair again and was shouted at to go this way and that way. I then underwent an intensive search in public. The wheelchair was scanned and that belonged to the airport. When he was finished I was told that I was sitting in the wheelchair with my legs apart and that looked suspicious. I suppose that and the fact that my body was shaking because I have Parkinson's made me a potential criminal at 73 years old.

I asked the tsa worker if she'd let her through as she's a nervous flyer and I didn't want to leave her behind panicking. They kindly did so. The queue for bag drop was so disorganised there was no real line, it would stop moving and no bags were scanned for 10 minutes and ther me are very few body scanners considering the size of the airport.

It took over an hour just to reach the ESTA machines. Due to poor signage, we asked what we should do with our little printouts from the machines and were directed along a corridor. Seconds later we were bellowed at by someone asking us to get back in the line. We explained that we'd been sent through but to no avail. We then collected our baggage and then we queued up to leave the airport and give another rude and sullen employee our stamped ticket. Altogether we had waited almost 2 hours. The taxi queue outside was unbelievable. Not due to lack of taxis but to the traffic chaos outside. Everyone for arrivals and departures are at the same place. Cars, buses, taxis with lanes constantly blocked by people stopping wherever they felt like it to unload / load etc. An employee ran up and down, yelling and blowing a whistle to keep the traffic moving. Nowhere is adequately signed e.g. Stand A, B etc. There is just one sign - Passenger Pick up and Drop off. I assume this means along the whole length of the airport. Hence no-one knows where exactly to wait. Everyone asked everyone else what to do. It was absolute chaos. In the queue for the taxi passengers further down were always trying to cut in but after an hour and a half wait, I couldn't blame them. From leaving the plane to getting a taxi took 3.5 hours.

JFK is the worst airport I have ever used, and I've used many. It is almost impossible to make a 3 hour layover as the lines to immigration go forever. You get out of the plane and the line starts already at gate entrance. There is no information what this line was for or what is going on. The only spoken announcements were initially in Spanish. Staff were rude and unhelpful. Took 2 hours to clear immigration, then 30 minutes to check in for the next flight. You need to claim your luggage before transfer. Made it only because my next flight was first delayed, then cancelled - something that happens frequently at JFK.

There were no trays available just put the bag on the conveyor belt as is and the staff screamed at anyone who started to take laptops etc out. Never seen anything like it, got the impression that they were completely overwhelmed and disorganised. would expect that an airport serving one of the world's major cities would at least have the security check properly organised, not the chaos we found.

Even some US citizens were caught up in the immigration lines because they were not shown through; there were frequently discourteous shouts for us to get in a single file, keep to the right, keep up, stay back, don't move yet, have this ready - when we eventually (after 3/4 hour) emerged into the main 'queuing pen' we could see roughly half of all the security checking positions were closed at a time when three large planes had just arrived! In this snaking queue we took a further 1.5 hours to reach the immigration officer. As we presented our UK / European Union passports the officer snapped questions at us: where are you from? Where are you staying? Why are you going there? Only when we said we would be at Notre Dame University did we get a flicker of human warmth! There were more US Homeland Security officers 30 metres further on who were even more intimidating and unfriendly: sarcastic, arrogant, rude; we came off relatively well - a small group of Chinese visitors got very rough treatment. Anyway, they were ordered to get into two groups and marched off somewhere - and New York aspires to be the most visited city in the world!! That was arrival at JFK - our departure from the USA, 3 weeks later was worse! On our journey home from the Midwest, JFK was our transit airport; we'd had a very easy, trouble-free short early morning flight from South Bend (IN) to Newark, took the frequent (and reasonably-priced) NYC Airporter bus service to JFK, and settled down to a patient wait till around 4 to check-in; no problem, plenty of time, no need to rush. We took turns to check the monitors for boarding information. Appreciating that it's a busy time of day to travel, we tried to queue over an hour before necessary - just to be sure of being in good time - Gate 9, the overhead display showed. Gates 1 to 8 are marked, in order - no Gate 9. Altogether we asked 5 different airport staff about this; replies ranged from 'I don't know' to 'it's all the same' to nothing because they had insufficient English! So, we dutifully waited in an undifferentiated snaking queue. This was so densely packed that it was very hot (outside air temp only 8 degrees C) - small children got very fractious; some elderly people looked distressed; a fight nearly broke out when one passenger (accidentally) barged another. The numerous airport staff just looked on, or looked away! None of them seemed to realise that passengers needed to be sorted according to their flight's departure time! It was only pure luck that we got through security checking exactly at the moment that the last call for boarding our flight went out! The airport's damned chaotic, inefficient systems had almost made us miss a flight which we'd arrived for 6 hours ahead! I don't actually blame the 'foot soldiers' - the lowly airport staff are hopeless but they're probably on minimum wage and get zero training!

We were tired, we were thirsty and we were stuck in a long, long queue, a smile or two would have been nice. When we got to the front of the queue we were greeted by the most obnoxiously rude woman it has ever been my displeasure to meet. We'd watched her taking what seemed like forever to deal with the people in the queue in front of us. She looked red in the face and harassed and I felt a little sorry for her. For some reason our queue seemed to be moving far slower than the ones around us and I thought, maybe, she was new. The people before us were eventually done and moved away so I moved forward only to be shouted at. ""I didn't call you. Go back behind the line and wait until I say. It's going to be a long time."" At this point I'd have turned round and got a plane out of there right then if I could. Eventually, after she felt she'd kept us and all the people behind us waiting long enough she called us forward with a glare. There was no greeting, no smile, just a barked, ""why have you come here?"" spat in what sounded like an accusation. ""Holiday,"" I said. What I wanted to say was 'right now I have no idea but I rather wish I hadn't.' ""How long."" ""Three days,"" suddenly three days seemed about two days twenty three and a half hours too long. ""Right hand. Four fingers on the green light,"" was the next command, followed by ""thumb."" Then it was all repeated with the other hand.

I am a seasoned traveller and have previously travelled to Chicago, they were slicker and far more friendly. I knew it was going to be trouble at border control, four officers for the 100 or so US citizens, four officers for the 600+ international line. As we were told 3 long haul flights got in within 20 minutes of each other. Ludicrous, have more staff to accommodate the greater demand. You are barked at by the most patronising, power happy lot I have ever come across. Is that a pre-requisite to getting a job with border control? These are the first faces that international travellers see, put your best people here. Just to get our passports checked took an hour and 30 minutes.

We had to wait for 3 hours and 15 minutes for passport security check. I understand the need for security but what has really upset me and all the rest of the folks in the queue is the fact that most of the counters for non US citizens were closed and number of incoming flights and passegers is obviously something that can be planned in advance. If all the counters had been open the wating time would have been something reasonable. Honestly I see this as a total lack of respect for tourists, since I do understand that it requires more personnel to have all counters open but this should be compared with the hours lost by thousands of passengers. Ironically during these 3 hours we had screens showing passport control images with no queues and smiling people all around. Once security checks were completed we had to search for our luggage that was scattered around the belts since clearly we couldn't collect it in time. Disorganization at JFK was amazing and an incredibly poor image was given by US upon entering the country and this is even stranger considering that in all the rest of the trip in the US (for example in the National Parks) I found an excellent organization and very helpful people.

Newark's is better as it tells you which airlines serve which terminal, although for JFK it's advisable to just look out the window. The interior of terminal 4 itself is spacious, light and pristine. The signs are largely clear to follow, although check-in desks aren't shown on screens in the check-in hall. Again, just use your eyes and look for the corporate livery above the desks.

Again, security didn't listen to what he had to say, just brushed him off and walked away. All of their flights were delayed by 35-40 minutes. If security would have taken the time to help these young, underage minors, they would have all made their flights. My son got to his gate and he could see the plane at the gate. Nobody would do anything to help him. The airline told me I should have purchased the unattended minor program for over $400 both ways, but they told me that the unattended minor program only starts when the child gets to the gate.
