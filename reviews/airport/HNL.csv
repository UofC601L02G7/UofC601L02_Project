2024-06-18,1,10,"""This is beyond bad service""",J Keale,"✅ Trip Verified |  The staff at the airport were by far the worst I have ever experienced. The airline staff made a mistake with my bday so with my ticket could not go through check in after waiting in line. When rushing back from the ticket counter with the right ticket, there were only 10 min left from the final call, so I asked the queuing staff if they could help me, both of them answered with cold voice and poker face: NO! After finally getting to the front of the line by asking favors from 100+ passengers, I told the lady who did my security check that I was terribly late. She’s like: that’s why you need to get here earlier. I explained to her that airplane made a mistake and this was my second time thought the security line. She said with a big smile: looks like not only you were not able to get in the last time, you are not going to get in this time either. You are going to miss your flight. And she said in a way as if she’s super happy that this happened to me. This is beyond bad service, it felt very inhumane. After all, what type of human with basic integrity would do/say things like this to a 6 months pregnant women who’s worried sick.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Honolulu airport is not set up for this kind of travel - which I'm sure is not unique. There are no ways to get from Terminal 1 (Hawaiian airlines exclusively) to Terminal 2 (all other airlines) without walking - outside - for 1/2 a mile. This is done while dragging your checked luggage. Once you get to Terminal 2 you then have to make your way to your airline. Delta, to my bad luck, was another 1/2 mile away. My husband was making this trek on a knee scooter so I - somewhat healthier - was dragging 2 checked bags. In the in-flight magazine there was some mention of a Wiki Shuttle but I saw no evidence of that and believe that was only available once you passed security. All other international airports I've been in have some sort of passenger moving system - train, tram, bus, etc. Invest is something! Once at my gate I had to search for a water fountain. Do you realize how many travelers have water bottles to fill. 1 station in the F concourse is not sufficient when most travelers are boarding a 6+ hour flight.

2022-01-05,1,10,"""tops the worst airports""",Ramela Carnell,"Not Verified | Honolulu International Airport tops the worst airports I have ever experienced. After arrival, we had to go through a Covid screening check point which took over 2 hours. The lady at the check point held on to my ID while I had to upload my vaccine card into the Hawaii Safe Travel portal and forgot to give it back to me. Once we passed the secured area I remembered and asked the security guard if I could go back to get my ID. The guard of course didn’t speak English and while I was trying to explain I need to get my ID back from desk #1 which was like 50 feet away, I was yelled at by another security guard to go through the TSA check point again and through the Covid line only to get my ID. I said I don’t have a boarding pass and can’t get through TSA and he said “that’s your problem!” I asked if they could please send someone to get my ID and they said I should go back to delta and ask for a pass to go through TSA which took me in a circle around the airport to get to the Covid screening line. Once at desk #1, the lady who had held my ID, said she had just given it to a security guard and I have to go to their office to get it back. So I had to find where their office was which no one apparently knew where it was, only to get to a desk with two ladies sitting and while I explained my ID should’ve been brought here, they not only didn’t help but started answering phone calls with me still standing behind the desk. I had to ask multiple times for someone to please help me so I could go home and that my husband and dog have been waiting outside for me for hours. I haven’t even mentioned how rude some of the airport staff were and how clueless they were about the airport and how it works. Thai airport system is a disaster. Our experience here was a nightmare and I don’t wish it upon anyone especially after a long flight back home. This needs to get fixed!

We had to traverse the line three times while others had a straight shot in--and I'm not referring to the active duty personnel and their families.

2019-10-12,1,10,"""each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed""",W James,"✅ Trip Verified | What an armpit. I don't know what else to say! Thankfully, the State of Hawaii appears to be finally, slowly moving to revitalize this ancient relic of air travel, but who knows how long that'll take?! I've flown in or out of Honolulu three times, each time, I've been beyond underwhelmed, and it's legitimately hard for me to even think of anything positive to say about this place (as if you couldn't tell already). To elaborate: The layout had to have designed by a third-grader (and that may even be an insult to third-graders), illogical, seemingly lackadaisical, with unnecessarily long walking with little art work and shops along the way. Oh, and poor signage, as you're approaching and leaving the airport and within the airport. The exterior just looks little better than what I imagine a bombed-out set of the show M*A*S*H would've looked like, but at least there are some neat tropical plants here and there. There is no tram, which makes it horrifyingly handicapped-inaccessible to travel between security, terminals and gates. Few airports I've ever been to seem to have more intentionally curt, unpleasant personnel than Honolulu, whether they're check-in and ticketing agents, TSA, customs and immigration, Starbucks baristas, or bartenders. Security is astonishingly slow and ""un-methodically methodical"", even having TSA Pre-Check helps, but just a little. The only perk is the people who are wearing leis, and greet you into Hawaii with smiles as the plane is disembarking. Just avoid this place if you possibly can, it is easily avoidable if you're flying from the Americas or Europe, if you know what you're doing, but probably not avoidable if you're flying from Australasia or Asia.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The ticketing lobby was so small, that they had to have security at PreCheck to let people pass from one side to the other side. Then when the Precheck line was shorter, they would allow you to enter the building to get in line. Rest of the experience was ok. There seems to be a lack of knowledge in at least the employees we talked with, exception HA employees, to be able to guide you anywhere. We heard multiple complaints about this while waiting to figure out where we were really suppose to go. We have never experienced such a lack of organization.

Scan passport etc. The machine then walks you through weighing bags etc before printing off your boarding passes, bag tags and receipt for any costs. You then need to join the bag drop off queue once you work out where it ends as the queues for the bag weigh machines stem out around circular hubs and invariably merge with the single bag drop queue. Once you’ve dropped off your bag, you need to work out which security queue you need to be in. Security B is TSA and the others A, C and D are for all others. We were in C despite this being clearly labelled “international” when we were going to Mainland US. Once you get through security, options for food etc are ok. Toilets were dated but clean.

I waited in a security line labelled TSA pre-check, which was approx. 20 yards long. After 10 minute wait, a staff member came to us and told us to move to another area to wait, and assured me that there also was a TSA pre-check. Once I walked 40 yards to get to the new area, one had to enter through a door, and encountered another member of staff. She rudely said ""no separate for pre-check"". The line was long and winding, and since 20-30 showed up more after us, there was now going back to the original line. We did not want this somewhat inefficient experience to ruin our Hawaii vacation, so we patiently waited. After 20 minutes of wait, a group of 20-30 travellers showed up. Since there were so many of them, the security staff decided to open up a new line and let these folks essentially go to the front of the line! The staff said this was being done to move the lines along. What about those of us with Pre-check, who showed up 2 hours earlier, patiently waiting in line? What is maddening the most, is the complete lack of organization. No preferential treatment for people who were waiting in line, no preferential treatment for TSA pre-check, etc. The line is being managed by someone who could care less about customer service or fairness.

Because we rode in the front of the plane, there was minimal wait getting through customs and, for once, we had the good fortune to be interviewed by a human TSA agent. After you collect your bags from the carousel, you have to stand in line again to run all your checked and carry-on baggage through an x-ray machine. They're searching for biological items that could disrupt Hawaii's agricultural balance. Upon exiting x-ray, you hand over your checked luggage, and all the in-transit passengers are directed to a specific exit. Once outside the exit, you have no idea where to go. There are no signs. We asked an airport employee outside, who acted like we greatly inconvenienced her with our question. She waved us off toward another building, and we dodged busy vehicle traffic to cross a road, dragging our bags. Upon arriving at the second building's entrance, we rode an escalator up to the second floor to go through security screening again, in order to board our connecting flight. We were then told that we had to exit the building and re-enter through another door to get to security. Brilliant logistics, whoever planned that mess. So we went outside, walked down to the next door, went back in and breezed through security due to our TSA pre-check status. After security, we inquired where to find the Business Class Lounge and were told that it was in the other building. So to use the lounge, we'd have had to retrace all our steps, undergo security screening in the other building, only to return two hours later to undergo security screening a third time before boarding our flight. Again brilliant planning. While standing in line to board our flight, an extremely arrogant Hawaiian Air employee showed up and began to bark orders about the size of carry-on bags. When a woman near us had the audacity to answer that her carry-on bag had accompanied her thus far, so she knew it fit, he grabbed it and measured it, and declared that it didn't fit. We could all see that it did indeed fit into the metal measuring standard at the gate, but he grabbed it from her, tagged it, ordered her to take any medications out of it, and sent it off to be loaded under the plane. He did the same to her husband. Then he directed his attention at Hubby and me, and I showed him our first class tickets. He retreated, though my carry-on was obviously wider than theirs, and went on to harass other poor souls flying economy class. It's evident that this old airport was thrown together hodgepodge and there was absolutely no planning for passenger convenience or ease of access. I am utterly disgusted with Hawaiian Airlines airport staff at Honolulu.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'December 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-11-09,1,10,"""gave up waiting for my wheelchair""",D Telford,"Arrived at HNL after flight was delayed for 3 hours. Gave up waiting for my wheelchair to be returned to me at the gate. Made my own way to baggage claim with my wife's help. Lots of building work so it was very confusing to navigate. Finally arrived at baggage reclaim to find all of my fellow travellers still there. Only 2 baggage handlers on duty apparently. Finally managed to collect our cases with the assistance of another passenger. Asked one man where my wheelchair would arrive. He smiled and said, ""don't know"" and that was it. We got it back shortly afterwards. Finally made it to the car rental shuttle bus to take us to the new car hire building. The airport looked like a building site and a poorly organised one at that. Insufficient staff and signage available to help able bodied and disabled passengers alike. It was also deserted, something that I did not expect for an international airport. It took me 20 minutes, with assistance, to get off the plane, get luggage and clear immigration / customs at LAX. It took me an hour just to find baggage claim and get my luggage at HNL.

2015-06-27,6,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,J Wagner,"Having traveled to and through Honolulu quite a lot over the past two years, I have to agree that it is an older and sometimes chaotic airport but I always found it tolerable and somewhat charming in a tropical sort of way until now (arrival, taxis etc are another matter). Traveling from here to the other islands has sometimes been unpredictable but I have had no real complaints. But now (2015) the usual difficulties of traveling out of Honolulu have been compounded by construction. Problems include crammed lines at agriculture security, no one to deal with priority customers (in my case American Airlines), a long walk and terrible mash up of a line up at the non TSA checkpoint (curiously my line this time around - June - was almost all females with children), one line for everyone, no faster lane as in almost all medium sized or large airports. I am sorry for older folks or folks with disabilities who might have to contend with this. There is one positive thing at HNL and that is that I have always found the Security staff to be polite and usually cheery. That makes the airport experience more tolerable.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-11-20,3,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,Peter Hartikka,"I transited HNL twice on my way from San Francisco to Auckland recently and wished I hadn't. On my outbound trip after I got off my flight from SF I searched for information about where my connecting gate was. There was simply none to be had the first screens I found were blank then there were some ""arrivals"" screens (not very helpful in the departures area). I walked halfway down the terminal to baggage claim in the heat since there was no continuous air-conditioned walkway and the first ""departures"" screen I found only had about one hour's worth of flights on it; mine was still two hours away. Just then I heard a loudspeaker announcement saying it would depart from the gate right next to the one from which I had just disembarked. The return trip was not much better there was a similar lack of information compounded by the need to go through customs and immigration. It became clear that HNL was never meant as an international transit point - the path of travel was chaotic (up stairs down stairs through various inside and outside corridors to end up close to where I had started in the first place) and the personnel surly. Not much aloha here. It's also worth mentioning that the terminal has birds flying around it to such an extent that some of the seats in the departure lounge had bird poop on them.",,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2014-09-17,7,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,Brian E Smith,It is an old and open-air airport and I imagine it is not like any other you have flown through. It could be larger especially the airport lounges (and they could be closer to the gates). That said it is easy to navigate there are enough shops around the gates though there could be more food options. The gate areas are small and far from the main terminal where security is located. It could do with a massive renovation but I am nostalgic and have been using HNL since the 1970's and it kind of takes me back.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2013-03-22,3,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,John Smithers,Although the design of the airport may have worked in the 70s when it was built today's security requirements make many of the airport's spaces either cramped or abandoned. The first floor gates have ugly dividers corralling the gates creating narrow bottlenecks in the passageways. Meanwhile the entire second floor is completely abandoned with old ceiling tiles laying about. In general it isn't a very welcoming design.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2012-10-27,7,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,Mike Villanueva,Aesthetically Honolulu Airport is a throwback to the 70s. For a place that is supposed to welcome people to a tropical paradise it is heavy and dark concrete architecture. There needs to be more wood greenery and updates to the fixtures. If you are taking Hawaiian Airlines to a connecting neighbor island flight be prepared to walk if you are in the far terminal where some mainland and international flights are parked. Its even a farther walk (or ride on the Wiki-wiki shuttle) if you're on Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Seattle parked at the far terminal and we had less than an hour to our connecting flight to Hilo. It was a mad dash with several co-passengers in tow scrambling for directions. Fortunately we made it in time. The airport is trying to make improvements and there are better dining options along with more shopping for people waiting at the gates for their flight. You may want to eat before coming to the airport as prices are steep. Its really nice to hear announcements in Hawaiian too which reminds you this is Hawaii after all.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-09-12,2,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,Benjamin Pittman,Although they are trying to improve the airport at least in a cosmetic sense it has to be once of the worst designs ever with marathon hikes to go anywhere and dark dingy areas which are truly hideous. Having come and gone through Honolulu some 12 times since early 2011 I can at least say that the immigration security and customs people are generally pleasant and polite this not always being the case in the US who generally have some of the rudest and surliest officials on earth! Officiousness and coldness are general characteristics elsewhere in my experience over 50 years plus of travel. Since I spend a lot of time in Hawaii where I own a home there is at least a bit of a positive here.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2011-07-15,2,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,J Danan,I was amazed that a city so known for its tourism has such an outdated airport. Someone wrote that the decor was 1980's I would say it looks like vintage 1960's or 70's. The bathrooms looked as old in disrepair and with filthy floors. There is no free wifi nor could I find a place to charge up my electronics. You have to get around on a clunky bus shuttle between terminals and there are no good restaurants out by the gates. I ate literally the worst sandwich of my life at the Quiznos subs; it was total (overpriced) lump of mush. It's not even possible to buy a bag of normal packaged pretzels at the newstand just a tiny zip-lock bag of them for $5. Positives: you can buy leis upon arrival and even the security staff had that friendly aloha spirit.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2011-05-14,1,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,J Rose,Whoever designed this airport must not have been thinking too clearly or had very little background in airport design. This is without a doubt one of the world's most confusing illogical places to depart arrive or change planes. There is no sensible flow from one part of the airport to the other. Gates are scattered about in a way that makes it difficult to get from one to the other. Transport between terminals via Wiki-Wiki shuttle is inefficient. Arriving internationally involved the longest walk imaginable from the gate to customs. No signage at all after clearing customs for onward journeys on domestic flights. They should tear it down and start over.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-10-12,1,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,Cathy Hartigan,Found the checkin and agriculture check in process at Honolulu airport totally chaotic and staffing unable to cope with demand. Long winding lines of hundreds of confused and stressed people queuing to check baggage at kiosks as commanded by 2 yelling roving staff. Directions are not apparent outside the airport building (where lines begin) and its not until you reach the beginning of the queue and get close to a human to find out you need to be on another line. People were treated like cattle. We were in a line for an hour and a half lost our visa card in the confusion and were charged baggage fees when not required.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-09-06,2,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,E Mabley,Inter-island terminal (also used by Hawaiian Airlines flights to the U.S. mainland). The terminal looks like a 1980s time warp.

2010-09-01,3,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,Steve Conroy,This is an unusual airport to say the least. International arrivals are relatively straight forward although the immigration hall can be very crowded when 2 or more flights arrive. Waiting times in excess of an hour are not unusual in the passport control hall. Queues can be horrendous and disorganised at International check-in. If you are flying Star Class on Jet Star beware that you do have a priority check-in but there are no signs directing you to it. This can easily save you an hour. Security staff are typically surly and disinterested TSA employees. They try to cram as many people as possible through one small x-ray machine/metal detector so allow a minimum of 30 minutes to clear security. Airside is average - whilst it is hardly to the standard of Changi or Hong Kong there are some shops selling overpriced souvenirs books and food. The open air walkways are very pleasant and provide a nice tropical feel to the terminal. International departure lounges are very plain with old and uncomfortable seats. A full A330/B747 will result in standing room only. They apply a quarantine method here: once you are in your departure lounge you cannot go back to the shops. Overall it is probably one of the better US airports but it still has a lot of work to do.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The bars/diners may not be the best nor cheapest but it is O'ahu; it has to be expected. The plant shops are a delight for those who like growing things. Produce not so much. My gripe is the staff at check in & security. They appear to hate their jobs yet feel secure in them. Try security upon leaving. Go First Class on United United do not care & security will ignore ""Priority"" passengers just because scanty clad young(ish) girlies are going through. Whooppee! One month later premier economy... ""You are not flying First sir I know! use THAT line"" YEP He knew exactly which class I was flying each time & yet failed to give any priority. Males be warned. So I shall not be flying first through THAT airport again. All the islands have airports they all inter-connect. Really the directly employed staff let down HNL & leave a very nasty taste with their attitude. This Xmas we shall be trying Kaui'i.

2010-04-19,3,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,N Werner,Arrived and departed during lunch time on Delta. Once you deplane you have to walk a long way to the Delta baggage claim and signage is not very good. The airport is old but everything works. I found it quite interesting to leave the gate area and walk outdoors to the main terminal where baggage claim and the arrival hall is. Baggage was delivered within a few minutes after the first pax made the long hike. Once outside I found the official airport shuttle to Waikiki and was on my way. Departure was just as swift with your bags being scanned by the agriculture department before heading to check-in. The departure lobby is really very old and baggages are stacked behind the check-in counter before being transported to the plane. Security was quite quick and if you are leaving on an international flight you have a nice choice of duty free goods but if you leave on a domestic flight like I did there really is not much. I had some Japanese food before heading to the gate area and I was glad that the plane left almost on time as it's pretty boring being stuck in that airport for long. As I was on vacation I did not mind HNL but I guess if you are travelling on business through HNL on a regular basis it would not be such a good experience.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-02-26,3,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,David Russell,Been five years since we last used this airport and it's still exactly the same. A throw back to the 60's although they appear to be doing some upgrade work at the moment. Be aware if you are on an early morning flight we had a 7am departure and all checked baggage has to be screened by the agriculture department before you can go to check in and nothing opens before 5am so no point in arriving mega early. Not a lot in the way of eateries and everything very basic. Staff friendly enough though. Never a problem with immigration as most international travelers from Europe have already cleared immigration prior to departing for Honolulu. No hassles.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-02-12,2,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,D Rettie,I was first at Honolulu Airport in 1981 and thought it was an airport out of the 1960's. Nothing has changed much. I was there in December 2008 (in transit) and again in January 2009 on way back to Sydney. The decor has not changed the food choices are very limited and so are the shops. Pity if you are catching an Hawaiian Airlines flight. After we checked in got our boarding passes and went through security you have to walk for miles to the gate (no shuttle bus was made available. They make an announcement to passengers to enter the gate lounge but once there you cannot leave (pity if you have to go to the toilet). Only one small shop available to buy souvenirs and only place to purchase drinks near the gate was Starbucks and they were a rip-off. Honolulu is in desperate need of a makeover as it looks old and tired.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}

2008-05-23,3,10,Honolulu Airport customer review,W Van den Haas,"I have been travelling thru the Honolulu airport for over 15 years and many of the comments here are very true. Poor decor very poor signage uneven staff regarding knowledge and ""aloha spirit"". But many are just fine helpful. Fortunately its not a large airport which makes it easier to have patience. The food choices and shopping you see at other international airports just does not exist. Most taxis are honest and the rates are approx $3.00 per mile to the Waikiki area 12 miles away. But some are not. I had one airport taxi charge me $49 to Waikiki. Thats not even close even in bad traffic. I have found its easiest to make arrangements with one of the flat rate ""car service"" companies. Its less than full meter rates and most dont charge for regular baggage. They will have someone waiting for you. Its nice to know you'll be on your way when your ready. Security checkpoints can often be long and curbside for departures can also get congested. Because of Hawaii's location and the time differences to Asia and US Mainland many flight arrive and depart within the same time ""window"" to accommodate with the mainland schedules. Its unavoidable. Overall its not the best airport but not the worst either.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}

One commentator likened it to a cement parkade. Once past the security area it does get better. The open area is very nice. Though small in size there is a lovely garden area in a V shape where one can walk and watch the planes dock and depart.

Restaurants cafesduty free internet etc! The check in area at the inter island terminal is a mess with 2 security check points both for mainland and international flights. So if your on a Hawaiian flight you must stay in the queue which ends outside the door of the terminal at peak times with no signage. Make it a true aloha welcome!,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
