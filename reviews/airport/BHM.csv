2024-06-09,1,10,"""Don’t fly out of BHM""",Jamarkus Burch,"Not Verified |   Staff should be retrained on customer service! Especially American. They are very rude and disrespectful. Flight crew got off the plane and went to another gate 20 min after we were “suppose” to board. When we asked what’s going on we received nothing but attitude from the gate agent. Another gate agent walked up and totally ignored our concerns. We’re at B1 for flight 5253 to CLT. Shortly after the gate agent says there is a maintenance issue and they won’t be in for another 2 hours. We all had the same question: Why wasn’t the plane inspected the night before, being it’s an early morning flight. Secondly, why isn’t maintenance on-site during hours of operation? This is very unprofessional! If there were other options outside of this place that were closer I’d explore it because no one deserves to be treated this way especially early in the morning. I’d rather drive 3 hours to Atlanta than to deal with these Attitudes after we pay our money for a service! My recommendation Don’t fly out of BHM especially with American !",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2024-05-21,4,10,"""Food options are very limited""",A Anderson,✅ Trip Verified | Spent the last two days and one night inside the airport. My husband went to several different bathrooms and he said they all smell like urine. Terrible like the guy mopping is just smearing all around. The women’s bathroom had dirty floors and pieces of trash lying around. Several of the toilets weren’t flushed. Food options are very limited. Bham is a foodie city and we should show that off to the world. Maybe allow local favorites to set up pop ups during the tourist seasons!! I could give you tons of recommendations as to who to invite and share their menus with travelers. Give them a true taste of Birmingham.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2022-03-06,5,10,"""Security lines are insane""",Colleen Rotkis,"Not Verified |  Security lines are insane. This is my 3rd experience with it, and I’m starting to piece together the scam. Don’t we pay a surcharge on every ticket purchased for the delightful experience of trusting TSA to keep us safe by making us remove our shoes and other useless acts. They keep the security lines long creating stress and panic so you consider signing up for Clear ($179/year and more privacy invasion with a retina scan and fingerprint capture). So the elite (those willing to fork over the dollars on top of their federal and any other taxes that fund airports and plane ticket fees) cruise on through security while the other ~97% of passengers languish in line and miss their flights. How on earth the warlord of the Birmingham airport allows 70% of TSA staff to service the elites on the TSA Precheck/Clear side vs the 30% (~4 TSA employees) on the side of the regular people, only makes sense in a corrupt government deal. I thought that this would be aggravating for the airlines on the other side of the curtain wondering where the passengers were who paid a pretty penny to fly like cattle while being prodded to pull their masks over their nose the whole time. But a little research revealed that the airlines invest in companies like Clear. Silly me. It’s a circular racquet probably formulated along the lines of the Chicago red light camera and parking meter debacle. Bottom line: pay your toll at the troll bridge or suffer along with the peasants.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2017-02-10,10,10,"""exceptional across the board""",Don Orlando,"Birmingham-Shuttlesworth Airport is absolutely exceptional across the board. Modern, well laid out, and astonishingly clean. Good facilities throughout. Parking easy and close to the terminal. The modernization of all the facilities done smoothly. I live 90 miles away close to another commercial airport, but gladly drive the three hour round trip to fly from BHM as I will in April.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'February 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-08-29,7,10,Birmingham-Shuttlesworth Airport customer review,Iain Bagwell,"Overall I like BHM. It's small, staff (at least at Delta check in and gate) are super friendly. The amenities are good for a small regional airport. Bags are usually quick to retrieve. My one gripe is parking. The parking deck is always almost very nearly completely full, so finding a space can often take as long as the short flight to connect in ATL. The one other thing that annoys me every time I do find a space is total lack of smart carts in the parking lots. Hey listen up Airport managers. This is an airport and customers travel with baggage. Don't you think it would be a great idea to facilitate this process of getting bags to terminals by offering a cart service in the parking lots?",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-09-13,6,10,Birmingham-Shuttlesworth Airport customer review,T Dokland,Recent Improvements have made this small airport quite reasonable. There are a few dining and shopping options and the area is fairly large and pleasant. They still play terrible elevator music. Free internet is a bonus. The airport is conveniently located to the city but there is no public transportation available. Parking is $12/day bit it is often difficult to find a spot.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-06-26,9,10,Birmingham-Shuttlesworth Airport customer review,L Brown,The airport has been and still under going renovations. The issues with no food past security have been fixed. The wait times are typically very short. Security can become long on Monday mornings but typically it is very quick as well. Walking distances to and from gates as well as to and from parking/car rental are rather short. There are no 1-2 miles walks to gates or otherwise. The biggest issue with the airport is the quality of staff at food outlets but that is not much different at a lot of airports. Overall it is a very good midsize airport.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2010-11-05,2,10,Birmingham-Shuttlesworth Airport customer review,J Eduardo,Poor airport overall. Limited food choices once past security. You are stuck with pizza or sandwiches no real sit down restaurants. Many of the food places close very early and start cleaning up the foods even earlier so you are out of luck if you get there too late. Only shops are Hudsons. I have been in smaller airports with much better facilities. Not very clean bathrooms were untidy and common area were just plain dirty benches with food spilled on them that sat for the entire 3 hours I waited for my flight. Not an airport I would ever want to be stuck in for an extended period.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
