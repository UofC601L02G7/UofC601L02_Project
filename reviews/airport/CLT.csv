However the reason I’m writing is because this place is filthy! I don’t want to touch a surface! I know they’re under construction but that doesn’t account for counters and corners and floors that obviously haven’t been scrubbed in a long time. Gross! Embarrassing! The survey asks if I would recommend this airport, and my reply is mixed. First off, airport choice is pretty arbitrary as it just depends on where you’re going, and also some aspects are great.

I don’t think that I’ve had a positive interaction with an employee there ever. They are very off-putting and rude. This is my home airport and it’s a shame that this is the impression that we give to people. No one is helpful. They don’t seem to want to be friendly or even pretend that their jobs is bearable. They are unprofessional and do not care to help anyone. There is a lack of seating in the airport. For some reason Concourse C is an absolute disaster at peak times. The wireless chargers seem cool at first, until you realize that most of them don’t work. Even the new ones. The walk time to get to your gate is average. No complaints. It’s expected for a major airport. My last flight had to be diverted for 4 hours due to the Charlotte Douglas employees not dumping the lavatories. Nice. Great job. We won’t even get started on the circus that is the arrivals area. Major traffic back ups. Construction with lanes closed. Employees blowing whistles. Yeah, that was a great idea and helped tremulously. Note my sarcasm. The management of the airport needs to get it together or hire someone who can. A hire standard should be held for employment there. You are embarrassment to the state of North Carolina.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

They consistently cut the line and force people to walk to the A TSA checkpoint. This morning they closed the line but instead of closing after the 4 people in line, they cut it and made 4 people walk down to A with 1 worker rather than close the line at the end. This is the 2nd time this has happened and the gentleman was extremely rude. Please begin customer service training since this is not the Charlotte experience and represents our city very poorly.

After waiting in a long line I purchased a cup of the worst coffee I ever had. I would have returned it but I expected they would not know how to handle it. I tossed it in the trash. I headed to my gate via the very crowded halls. I stopped to use the restroom only to find it unusable. The facilites were dirty and wet paper was on the floor of the stalls. There were hole in the walls exposing plumbing repaired long ago. At the gate, several adjacent flights were delayed causing a large crowds to overflow into surrounding gate areas.

Firstly, why doesn't this huge airport have a tram service. My flight from Richmond arrived at one end of the airport and connector to Pittsburgh at the other. We had been held on the ground for 3 hours because of weather and then 1 hour in the air. I am 84 and pretty healthy but could not have made the connection on foot 50 years ago. American Airlines did not give us connecting gate info upon deplaning. Told us to check message boards. I became lightheaded--no food or water for at least 3 hours while cramped on the arriving flight. When I realized that my connector was at the other end, there was no one to ask for help. Numerous passengers tried to get airport employees to help me and finally someone from American arrived with wheelchair. Develop a tram service. Not just for oldsters but for persons with young children. This is not a family friendly airport. Also 37 minutes is not at all sufficient time to make a connection.

So, first...the customs agent whose line we were assigned was horrible he was lazy and yawning at us. He was slow to do anything, it was actually laughable but sadly it didn’t end there and quickly became un-laughable. Charlotte has and is still undergoing renovation so it changes every time we connect through there. There is a huge lack of employees prepared to herd the crowds of travels. So, after another disappointing encounter with our carrier (who is getting their own earned review) we finally got onto a flight. But, of course our luggage did to make it home with us. Not surprised, not horribly upset because I still trust it’ll get here. Just goes to show employees at CLT don’t give a damn!

I pivoted to line up to wait for another checkpoint which was to be opened at 5:15am. You could see the TSA agents sauntering around on the catwalk above the queue. There was absolutely no sense of urgency. Then, at 5:15am when the metal shutters opened, we learned they were training a service dog, and that we needed to walk side by side slowly past the dog to help with the training. Poor planning on TSA and the airport's part. When there are early flights, have at least two checkpoints open. When it's a dog training day, open up the checkpoint earlier to accommodate the dog training. I made my flight with about 5 minutes to spare. Others were not so lucky.

At the terminals, there were thousands of people but only enough seats for about 30 people per gate so hundreds of people were crowding into the concourse. Even more people sitting on the ground around the concourse and many more waiting in line at American Airlines customer service - so it was incredibly crowded and a safety hazard. There wasn't enough seating in the food court, either. Almost every flight was delayed or cancelled. Our flight was supposed to leave at 8:30pm (already delayed) and we didn't actually leave until about 11pm. The floor was dirty and smelled like urine (likely from all the pets/service animals standing around). The women's bathroom had a broken unusable door and a long queue.

That or acting like they are completely ignoring you while gesturing. They made us take out our laptops from our bags and from laptop sleeves, both things I haven't had to do in years. They informed us of this by just yelling to take our time and hurry and remove everything. ""Remove what? Liquids?"" Response: ""take your time and hurry and remove everything."" ""Ok, so my liquid? All electronics?"" ""take your time and hurry and remove everything! But not that! Keep liquids in your bag! Laptop out! Hurry up!"" Just absolutely horrible. I get through security, try and board the plane. In the time I checked in (about 6 hours prior) and selected my seat (which I really just confirmed because the plane was full and it wasn't the worst seat) they changed my seat. Like, my digital boarding pass was invalid. Then they told me that my bag was too big and that I was required to check it. I have flown 5 flights in the last 3 days. Not once did they question it. The person in front of me had a larger bag in every dimension. I compared it as I stood in line behind/next to them for 10 min. They got on with no problem, and when I asked the ladies about it, they just ignored me. American has been changing everything about my trip constantly (example with the seat). I am unwilling to part with my bag because of this. I will never see it again. They print me a check bag tag even though I tell them not to. I end up removing a pair of jeans and two flannels which I put on, so I can zip it more. I ask, ""Can I get on the plane now?"" She walked away and threw away my checked bag tag.

There's also a good selection of food and drink at the airport, though prices are high. On the other hand, American schedules a lot of short connections through the airport, so you may not have time to enjoy the amenities.

No Seating accommodations for passengers who are stranded overnight which happens frequently for the slightest amount of rain. Only one bathroom on the entire 2nd-floor ticketing level. One bathroom for thousands of people. They’re so smart they put the smoking section right on the curbside which permeates the entire airport. All of the lines for food or drink are always packed. It’s always hot. They turn off their escalators so you have to climb stairs with your luggage. TSA is incapable of properly staffing their checkpoints which create massive waits! This due to the mistreatment of employees. Extremely narrow walkways in the concourses and again limited restrooms. They built a new concourse in A terminal and didn’t have the presence of mind to put seating for people to eat their food.

I'm going to list problems with some no-cost or low-cost solutions. 1) Concourses are narrow, so pedestrian traffic is a mess. People are constantly bumping, almost bumping, crossing in front of, and getting behind slow people. Last night, a member of the cleaning crew had parked a rolling garbage bin in the middle of the concourse (E) and was off to the side having a casual conversation with a vendor. This caused many pedestrian issues, in an already stressful environment. Solution: train cleaning crews about traffic in the concourses and how to treat customers better and NOT block their paths. 2) Continual gate change for arrivals, and - what seems like - confusion for the airplane waiting to pull into the appropriate gate. I don't know how much larger airports are so organized, but CLT needs to have systems in place for parking planes quickly at their gates to get people to their connecting flights on time. Last night in Concourse E Gate 17 (6/13/2019), 5 breathless passengers showed up to catch the last flight to Columbia SC that day. The unconcerned gate employee told them the doors were closed, and there was nothing he could do. Their incoming flight had been blocked from their gate for a time, making them late to the Columbia flight and that flight pulled away without them. super simple, cheap solution: have a gate ready for each arriving plane. If a plane has passengers for connections, communicate with their connecting plane's crew to please wait 3-5 minutes for the passengers to arrive. 3) Some of the slide-walks weren't working, and you need that extra boost in speed to reach long distances between connections (see above). Solutions: maintain existing equipment and keep it running. 4) Lots of trash, lots of people working who seemed to not want to be there, and boarding queues crowding the already narrow corridors - there needs to be some management improvement at this airport.

Our flight was delayed due to the President's visit and inclement weather. When we finally reached our gate after sitting on the tarmac for over an hour, we were delayed further due to a lack of staffing to park our aircraft. Once deplaned, we raced to our connection only to find the flight had closed (well outside of the 10-min window of departure time). The excuse provided for the lack of staffing at our arrival gate: lightning and staff safety. Yet, staff were evidently not in any danger to guide our departing flight out of the gate, a fact we found quite interesting. Many customers were left stranded and when trying to rebook flights, the responses from AA workers ranged from eye rolls to terse replies. Never did any employee of the airline or the airport acknowledge what every passenger was feeling. A simple, ""We understand you are upset and we are doing what we can to make the rest of your trip as pleasant as possible."" As we stood in a customer service line, one airline employee passed out customer service number tickets. When asked by several passengers where our luggage might be, she replied, ""Whatever flight you were supposed to be on, that's where your luggage is."" Many people informed her that our connections had already left before we arrived. Yet, she stuck with her (obviously incorrect) statement of next-flight luggage transport, absolutely clueless. We were able to rebook on a flight the next day (2 p.m.) but needed to find something earlier for work obligations. At 11:50 p.m. we left the main concourse, past the TSA area, and headed to the main ticketing counter. Unbeknownst to us (and hundreds others), TSA closes their gates at midnight. No signage, no verbal notice, no nothing. We were locked out of any food, beverages, seating, carpeting, etc. until the airport reopened at 4:30 a.m. We found a quiet place to sit (on the floor, with a locked door next to us) and charge our devices near the baggage carousel. Not long after settling in, an airport employee saunters up and says, ""You gone hafta move from that do'."" As we gather our things to move, the employee then says, ""I don't know why you so upset. You know you can't sit in front of that do'."" Our response: ""Because this airport is horrible."" His response: ""Ain't nobody tole you to come heah."" And this was the basic attitude of every single employee we encountered from our arrival until our eventual departure. We did attempt to make a purchase at the Starbucks at the ticket counter. True to CLT form, the oven was broken and they had run out of the one thing I cared to order. And passengers were due to arrive in less than 4 hours. To be served what remained to be seen. If the presence of a high-profile official and a brief storm delay can render this airport all but useless, an actual emergency will bring the entire city to its knees. There is clearly no plan to address the lack of airport personnel, availability of rental cars, hotel rooms, etc. and neither American Airlines nor the CLT airport gave any effort whatsoever to aid passengers in navigating such a challenging experience.

Upon entering customs we observe chaos. Different TSA employees are yelling at hundreds of customers to “direct” us all. After finally getting through customs we are yelled at to get our bags, fine. At the third threshold however three more TSA agents start giving everyone three different varieties of wrong directions. We end up missing our connecting flight and at the wrong area completely. More employees continue to curtly tell us we are all in the wrong area (although we had been yelled at to do so) and that we are SOL.

I have lived in Charlotte all my life and I am very familiar with the airport, but with all the construction going on at CLT there have been more issues I have encountered, mostly associated with parking, but this was probably was the worst out of all of them. I was flying American Airlines from Charlotte to Pittsburgh to see friends and normally I use Park N' Go but this time I decided I'd park in the Daily Decks since it was closer to the terminal I was only going for 3 days, I always avoid the Long Term lots since those lots are a zoo and they have been that way forever. When I parked the first shuttle was full so I waited almost 20 minutes for another one to come and when it came the driver offered no help to anyone with large suitcases. In the airport the line at check in was ridiculous, the agents were taking their sweet time checking people in, American app was not working so I couldn't check in with it. Check-in took about 25 minutes, security lines were insanely long and I finally ended up going to the E checkpoint even though my flight was at Concourse C since it was the least of all of evils but even then TSA still took almost an hour. TSA Staff were all very rude and were barking orders at people military style, I put my laptop in the plastic bin with my wallet, phone, and shoes like I have countless times before without a problem and the TSA agent barked at me claiming I wasn't following directions and that my laptop had to go in it's own container, I looked on TSA.gov and nowhere does it say that's required, all it says is you have to remove the laptop from your carry on, which I did. Of course since I knew they were just doing their job I didn't argue. I go through the scanner and wait for my bags and I couldn't find my backpack, I ask one of the agents and she flat out ignored me and said I was asking the wrong person. I finally saw them staring at my bag on the screen and I stood there until finally after 15 minutes an agent asked ""is this your bag"" and I said yes. As it turned out a set of souvenir coins that had formed a clump in my backpack apparently looked weird but when I asked if I could just take it out and show them what it was they yelled at me saying I wasn't allowed to touch the bag and I'd be denied boarding if I did. Nobody was willing to help, they were treating all the passengers like dogs, even children and the elderly, it was just appalling. There's a large amount of restaurants and retail outlets at CLT but once you're at the gate the seating areas are cramped and there is very limited seating. The concourses have hardly changed at all since the late 90s. Some of the gates in Concourse E still use ancient dot matrix printers. After the TSA incident I just barely made my flight by 15 minutes even though I arrived at the airport almost 2 hours prior, gate agent was the only nice person I encountered at the airport, she probably heard of the all the TSA problems from other passengers because when she scanned my ticket she said ""don't worry I wouldn't have closed the door on you"" she said there were 12 people on the flight still stuck in the TSA lines.

I have not flown a lot in my life but when I do I usually have 18+ hour journeys. As a citizen of the United States, it is nice to come back after a few years. Well, after an eight hour flight over the ocean, the first thing you are met with is passport control. I have to say that the TSA, guards and police who work there are some of the most unhappy, unhelpful, and rude people I have ever had the mispleasure of interacting with. There were many lines and unclear, sometimes conflicting instructions. We were met with a man who did nothing but treat everyone like an animal, yelling and being rude to people who were confused. Even after the handful of times I have flown, flying and airports are still daunting and I feel sorry for the people who are first time flyers or tourists who will be met with this the first time they are in the country. In May, when I arrived with my boyfriend from a European country, we were met with hostility. When attempting to go through the line, they asked if we were family, if we were from the same household, which we were. The woman simply barked at us that we were indeed not together or family before we could even say anything. She then told her colleague to not help us because we were trying to get through the line faster. We were separated, he needed to be pulled to another line and I was forced to wait at least an hour on the other side. Needless to say we missed our next flight. I've never been so poorly treated in my life. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I understand they have an important job to do but there is no excuse for being so hateful and so rude to people, most of which are confused or afraid. We were almost in tears by the time the process was over. This airport was a stark contrast to the previous in London which was quick, painless and effective. Charlotte Douglas is anything but. On a brighter note, after we got through security, we talked to a woman to rebook our flight and she was very nice and very helpful.

Honestly, I fly out of CLT very often, as it is frequently the airport where I am forced to take my connecting flight. I say forced, because the staff are absolutely awful. The food service and cleaning personnel are the kindest people I have met, however the check in attendants are the most entitled staff I have ever dealt with. Each and every time I go here (4 times in the past 2 months), the customer service provided is absolutely awful, not taking the customer into consideration whatsoever. I was asked to check my bag, and when I questioned why (as the bag could clearly fit beneath the seat in front of me), the man says to me ""because she said so."" And had no sort of explanation to follow. Of course when I finally boarded there was enough room for my bag in more than a few overhead bins. I do not recommend this airport at all. The only reason I do is for the kindness I have received from every food service or cleaning crew member, once I thought I lost my phone in the bathroom and the woman in there cleaning was so willing and so kind enough to help me find it.

The tray with my bag, sandals and triple sealed duty free bag went through the scanner and was put aside to be checked. Three trays were ahead of mine to be checked. It took 40 minutes before my bag was checked. Obviously staff did not know standard operating procedures regarding sealed duty free bags. There was no assistance, I was just told I had to wait. No manager in charge. The elderly man checking through the bags worked at a snail's pace, and despite my pleas did not ask for other security staff to assist. Absolutely disgraceful.
