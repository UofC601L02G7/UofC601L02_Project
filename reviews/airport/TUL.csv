I’ve missed more connection flights then I can count because of this mess of an airport. If you can, try to fly or connect out of literally anywhere else.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-01-06,10,10,"""one of the easiest airports to navigate""",B Williams,"✅ Trip Verified | Tulsa International Airport is, in my opinion, one of the easiest airports to navigate. It's not super large and everyone is very friendly. We were able to ride a free shuttle to our car as it was about 10 degrees when we arrived. The man driving the shuttle was very nice and took us all the way to our car. It was very convenient and nice.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2017-03-09,8,10,"""a nice small to medium sized airport""",L Watson,"✅ Verified Review |  Tulsa is a nice small to medium sized airport. It now has free wifi available throughout the airport. Only 5 or so airlines fly out of the airport, and it seems quite a few flights have been cut the past 5 years or so. The lines for TSA are rarely bad anymore. I have been through security in less than 10 mins after arriving at airport. Obviously there are times when it is busier. New seats at gates have plug ins available, and this is a very nice touch.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-10-26,5,10,"""just got a nice revamp""",John Lamb,I fly American a lot. The A terminal just got a nice revamp but there is a revolving door to get out of the gate area. This is such a slow door that they have people there to let you around it about 1/2 the time. I have complained to the airport about it several times and received no reply. You would think that after spending so much money for a remodel they would fix the one big thing I hear a lot of frequent travelers complain about.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
