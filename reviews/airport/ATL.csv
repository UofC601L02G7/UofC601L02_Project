I was directed to the International terminal parking by one of the many rude employees there. In the end, I parked off site until my daughter arrived picking her up at exit S2.

At this point you think you are done and can head to your gate, but no. Now you have to wait in another long line to go through security again. This is after you have been on a long international flight. Like seriously, what could I have picked up from the jet bridge to standing in the customs line? You finally make it through security and then you have to catch the train to your terminal! I have never seen such foolishness! None of this makes sense at all!

But the staff trying to guide us from an international arrival through passport, control, and baggage retrieval and whatever else were some of the most rude people I’ve ever encountered. I was so upset that this was going to be some of the people on my flights first experience in the United States, and they’re being yelled at and laughed at. If you fly, you know that an unfamiliar airport can be confusing. People would ask questions. Sometimes two people would ask the same question. One person I gave my passport to just flick his wrist slightly and looked at me like this. Is your passport take it the security wanted to see inside my bag and set it aside. It sat completely unattended for 10 minutes. I didn’t want to say anything to anybody because by this point, my experience had been so lousy, I figured they would purposely extend it and I might miss my connection. Restaurants are overcrowded lines of 100 people long at a Wendy’s. Bathrooms you can’t navigate because they’re too tight and people are toting bags all over the place. Flights that get delayed are not uncommon, but they seem to be more than common at this airport. I will purposely pay extra to never have to fly through this airport again.

Like many large airports, it is very busy; unlike many other airports, though, the vast majority of staff have no interest in helping anyone. Parking is full - staff waves you away without any information about alternative lots. Baggage check lines are long, staff sits on their butts, occasionally helping a customer every 5 minutes or so. Security officers are so busy yelling instructions to everyone that they can't answer a question, then lose their marbles if you do something wrong (I took my laptop out of my case like the majority of other security lines; the women started screaming like I was a child). Most restaurants inside the airport have employees staring at their cell phones, and both the service time and food quality reflect this. The only positive I can write is that this airport does allow direct flights to many places. However, I have begun to look at other airports (e.g., Columbia, SC and Charlotte, NC) to use - the extra hour or two drive is worthwhile to avoid ATL.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2024-06-07,1,10,“the least convenient airport experience”,B Lewis,"✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta wants to be an international city but the international terminal at Heathrow provides the least convenient airport experience I have ever encountered. On arrival in Atlanta, if you want to take public transport — the MARTA subway train — you have to get a bus from the international terminal back to the domestic terminal where the train station is located. The busses run infrequently, are hard to identify, crowded, and are manned by surly drivers, They drive you around the whole large airport so it takes around 45 minutes. We’d already waited that long for a bus just to come AND spent an hour getting through a long passport control queue. Why London airports can have e-gates you breeze through in minutes and Atlanta cannot is beyond me. If you think you’ll avoid all this hassle by renting a car, think again as to access the rental car centre you have to take the same slow airport bus to domestic PLUS then a shuttle out to the rental hub. All of it adds up to it taking a very long time to just get away from the airport after an already long international flight. Signage after baggage pick-up is also very poor which makes me feel very sorry for non-English speakers or really anyone arriving in Atlanta for the first time.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We had enough of a layover where there should have been plenty of time to make it to where we needed to be, but there were only a few custom's officers working the arrival of an entire international flight. We asked for help from multiple employees so that we could make our connecting flight and were told that they could not help us. We were told that we would just have to miss our flight and reschedule it for the next day! This was extremely frustrating because we had recently had a similar experience in Amsterdam where the staff there had bent over backwards and had done everything in their power to help us make our flight.... so we knew that things could be done better. They have a system worked out to assist passengers with occurrences like these. Atlanta employees need to take a training class from the Amsterdam airport. I would have expected so much more from such a large airport (in the United States no less), for which I guess I just had higher expectations. We were able to make our connecting flight but only because we had to make a desperate run through an extremely large airport which left us feeling miserable, exhausted, and stressed.

There was a stray wheelchair so my wife pushed me. We kept on asking airport personnel for help and they kept on saying it is not my job. Some people offered to get someone, but that never panned out.

At one point, a TSA official asked to take our bags, which we accepted. However we thought they would stay with us but they disappeared. We finally found the wheelchair assistance people and they did get us assistance, but was irritated that we were upset. They told us that our bags would be at our final destination and to quit worrying. They eventually took us to our terminal, although the person whined about how far it was.

No one is there to supervise the bottleneck of abandoned wheelchairs as we wobble pass the checkpoint. Do not blame the attendants! Its not their fault! Its the fault of the upper managers because they are not doing a good job of managing! It's shameful!

2023-10-02,2,10,"""nightmare of traveling through ATL""",E Kerr,"✅ Trip Verified | 1. After completing terminal F, for international travel, many years ago. Most international flights still depart from the E and T gates. 2. While the number of gates at F are limited, there is not adequate accommodation made for arriving passengers. Instead, if arriving into an E gate and it may be on either end of the concourse, they must walk about two miles, with limited moving walkways to F gate international passport control. After all of the years that have past since completion of terminal F one would expect a solution by now. 3. Being assigned for international travel at the E gates also means you suffer the absolute chaos of dining in the central part of this concourse where, for example, there is only one coffee shop, for all of terminal E. 4. Upon exiting passport control that can be hit or miss as to ordered chaos or mayhem, one has to wait upon luggage where despite at least 6 carousels, only two may be in use, each covering several flights. This does not make any sense to me. 5. If you had done the right airport recommended parking for the international Park & Ride (the receipt says Park ATL), standby for more chaos as you exit the concourse. There are several park and ride signs on different pillars along the first pavement. However unmarked is a pillar with queuing column tape that is for white (seemingly) unmarked minibuses. These are the transport to the park and ride (that by the way should say Park ATL, same as the receipt that I paid against). 6. I can only guess that those who design, upgrade or manage ATL do not travel, themselves. International arriving passengers that arrive there are often tired, disorientated and brain fogged. Even those who have travelled through ATL extensively and live in GA, are not immune to the chaos. 7. I would not say the on site staff and ATL are rude, but they are certainly not too friendly. Returning to the US feels like the first day you report for duty in the military or I guess, arrival to start a prison sentence. This is not the America I want to project and I am sure you don't either. 8. Sadly, there is no excuse for the atrocious state of ATL and it seems that someone needs to find another career. I have little desire to fly in or out of ATL, and I do not like the airline connections from my nearest airport, here in North GA. So, if anyone from Delta is reading this, yes, it affects you too, because my wife and I will be thinking twice before we undertake the nightmare of traveling through ATL again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Surprisingly my departure from ATL was uneventful that day. I arrived back home on Sunday 8/13/203. The train to baggage claim went to T gate, so I had to get off and walk and go up an escalator that had only 2 up escalators. The elevators weren't working. We had to then snake around to the security door on the southside and go through a glass security door. The door kept getting stuck because there are hundreds or maybe even thousands of people going through this door. The door got stuck and instead of the airport employee holding the door open she is hollering and clapping her hands and snapping her fingers like she is talking dealing with a herd of cattle, or a bunch dogs. This process of the train being down and having to walk to baggage claim seems to be the normal and not the exception. The airport workers are rude and do not offer assistance at all. When you ask for help, they are rude. On another travel experience I was leaving for Houston early morning, I was at the airport by 4 am and instead of the security checkpoint being open on the North terminal, everyone had to go through the main security terminal, thousands of people at 4-5 am and their explanation was the North terminal does not open until  5: 45.

The workers at the vendors were okay but the TSA staff were horrible. The facilities are adequate at best. They do have some nice art but they placed it outside the secured area (i.e., if you visit it, you'll be forced to go back through the slow security lines and deal with the rude TSA agents). Plus, the art is in a very high-traffic area on the way to/from baggage claims so stopping to look at anything is going to put you in the way of people who are already unhappy because they're being subjected to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. If you're stuck there overnight as I was, good luck finding food. Most of the vendors close. I was able to get food at the Burger King away from the terminals. Did I get a tasty Whopper? Nope.

To its credit, the signage to access the terminals from the highways and to leave the airport were, in my opinion, ample. The majority of personnel we met in that airport, even security, were polite and professional - the only reason I'm not giving this airport a completely flunking score. That includes personnel for both Delta and Frontier Airlines. The tram connecting the terminals is clean and wonderfully efficient. Some of the Delta SkyMiles lounges are national-class, even world-class. That's where my compliments end. Now here's the bad stuff: The airport is predominantly dirty (not as dirty as Denver or Seattle, but still pretty bad). There are few places to grab a bite to eat or something to drink pre-security. The baggage and ticket counters are cramped and narrow, unbecoming of the world's busiest airport. Most departure gates are also cramped and narrow, with little seating, also unbecoming of the world's busiest airport. The security lines are astonishingly inefficient, even by US large airport standards; using CLEAR and Pre-Check in tandem should take five minutes, even on a busy holiday or weekend - not 25+ minutes like it did. If you don't have an expedited security clearance like CLEAR or Pre-Check and have to wait in the normal line, 90+ minutes to get through security on the busiest of days isn't unheard of. Again, to security's credit, the TSA officers I met were nice enough, but there clearly aren't enough TSA officers staffed at ATL. And, to the credit of the thousands and thousands of passengers being herded like cattle, people behaved relatively orderly and politely. But thousands and thousands of passengers hourly shouldn't be beholden to the whims of government incompetence - which, like I've said, is unbecoming of the world's busiest airport.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I had already been through 2 customs when I arrived at the one in Atlanta to board my final flight, I had with me a few purchases bought at the Duty free airport in Paris. I had a mid size bottle of liquor which the custom agent insisted had to be put in my suitcase and my suitcase checked since apparently the duty free had forgotten to wrap it in a special plastic wrapper. Even though I had a receipt form the Duty free and a gift bag, the agent in no way educated enough to comprehend the difference, sent me back to the delta counter to open my suitcase, pack the bottle and register the suitcase. Thankfully I was lucky enough to find a gentleman at the Delta check-in who assisted me and was very kind. Admittedly from a few comments heard, I was not the first victim of the lack of understanding by the customs agents. One might say they are applying the rules, however is it applying the rules or is it enforcing the little power they have to unnecessarily harass travelers -  it is my understanding that they are continually inept at their job and take extreme pleasure in adding unpleasant and totally unnecessary steps to an already tired passenger?

I flew in to Atlanta and had just a few issues with my arrival into this airport so I figured it wouldn’t be awful if I booked a flight for my father to fly out of there. I cannot begin to describe how awful the experience was for my dad and I. The TSA were completely and unnecessarily rude to my dad who is easily confused and older, acted as if he had COVID or was diseased. The TSA agent literally looked as if she was about to draw a weapon on my dad because he was six feet away from her? Additionally the representative at the Delta check-in desk who is posted there to help guests pre-check for their tickets was also so awfully rude. Asked again, another simple question and she acted as if we were burden to ask her anything instead of just letting her stand there and ruin her uneventful day. Normally at my hometown airport, they usually let my dad come into the terminal with me to say goodbye as any day I could get orders to deploy and won’t have a chance to say goodbye before I go. But at this airport, I felt as though they were snatching him away from me and I was afraid he wasn’t going to make his flight because it is an extremely large airport and he is older and just overwhelmed easily. Thankfully and barely, he made it to his gate. He then told me that he was just extremely disappointed because the associates at the counter by the terminal were rude over the intercom every time they used it and just rude to other guests that went up to the counter. It made him so uncomfortable with the entire experience that he never wants to fly out of the airport again and would love it if I never did either. It made him so upset that he ended up crying part of his flight home. He’s concerned that somethings going to happen to me on deployment and he would’ve never gotten to have said goodbye.

2021-07-26,4,10,"""This airport is badly designed""",S Wilson,"✅ Trip Verified | This is probably the worst airport I have been through. And I once worked at JFK with its many terminals. I had to transit through this airport from Costa Rica to catch a domestic flight to JFK NYC. There are no restrooms in the immediate area. The plane I came off had one aisle. And the flight attendants spent a good deal of time using the aisle to serve snacks. So it's not always convenient to use the restroom on the aircraft. Common sense you would think they would place restrooms near where the gate is where we got off the plane. Then it's not like you can just walk to the CBP area. We had to stand there for as much as 15 minutes and more at least twice before being allowed to proceed to the long line to present our passports. Walking from the gate to the CBP seems like 1/4 of a mile. There were hundreds of people on the line. There is a restroom in that area but with such a long line and a connecting flight less than two hours of my arrival I did not want to chance using it then getting on line. The saving grace was that the customs officer did not take long with my passport. He basically looked at my photo, asked me to remove my mask then asked me if I am who it says I am. Then I was on my way. It took over one hour to exit the CBP line. Someone took my luggage and put it on the belt to be sent to my JFK NYC flight. As soon as we walked out of that area we all had to go through security as if we had just walked off the street. I overheard one of the TSA agents telling someone that until you reach age 75 you have to remove your shoes. Well around where I live I see people who could barely get on the bus without the driver lowering the stairs. And many of these people are not even 50 years old. After going through security I checked the board but could not find my flight listed. I asked a lady at information desk. She told me I had to take the shuttle train on the right hand side one stop to area E. And go to E11. I went to E11. No such flight. I went to the Delta counter I saw when I came to area E. The lady told me I had to go to E 31 and the flight is about to leave so I had to hurry. I was the last person to get on the plane when I heard them say they were about to close the door. A gate agent came with me. She said there was no more room for my carry-on so I had to check it but not before I removed my laptop and camera which most likely would be stolen. My advice is avoid this airport if you're connecting from an international flight. Connecting domestic to international was not an issue when I was leaving. Unless you got four hours between international arrival and your departure connection don't risk it. And putting a restroom all the way in the customs area serves no purpose because most people need to use the restroom as soon as they exit the plane. This airport is badly designed. When I was leaving for Costa Rica I arrived after 8 am on a weekday morning and none of the restaurants were open. Not even a place to serve coffee.

Once we got there and run around through the whole terminal, asked several staff members, who had no idea where Swift Air was, we finally got to one of the TSA members who used his radio to find out that Swift is at the International terminal. After we spend $50 on the taxi for 20 min drive, since we were running out of time, we got back to where we started. We ran through the whole terminal and finally found Swift Air counters all the way in the back of the terminal with no signs in the whole airport to guide people where to go, except for the signs on top of the counter.

I had quite a bit of food still left on my plate since I got full very fast; but don’t like traveling with unnecessary baggage. When I went to throw away my plate, a man was changing out the trash bags. When I handed him my plate, he opened the lid and very rudely told me how wasteful I was and that I shouldn’t be throwing away fresh food. When I walked away, I could hear him talking about me to his coworker and he continued to shake his head at me. I was irritated because I purchased the food with my own money and I’m not obligated to defend the amount that I choose not to eat.

Even the TSA Pre line had about a half hour plus wait. The airport itself looks old although clean and seems to lack some of the new tech like charging stations for devices that you would expect to find in this day and age. I flew JetBlue out of JFK for this trip and what a difference between JetBlues own terminal 5 and this hole in the wall. If you can avoid passing through this airport I highly recommend it as many of the people don’t really seem to care about the travelers passing through and if you have a connecting flight that’s either at a distant gate or concourse you may miss your flight as they are so far away.

The airport personnel tried to help expedite the kiosks (which don't generally help because no one really gets what you're supposed to do - the cards were easier!) in our case these people were quite helpful, but you had to wait in line for every step. It took us a full 1hr 30 min. to get through that, many of us figuring we were never going to make our next flights. An airport employee did look up our gate for us. Of course it was at the literal other end of the terminal (from Term F to A).

The airport authority clearly has a strong distaste for ride share companies and is doing all they can to frustrate travelers from using them. After walking a mile from the gate to the ground transportation area, I had to ask 3 individuals how to get to the ride share area before I found the down escalator nestled among the baggage carousels that took me to the correct exit. Upon finding the exit, it was another mile walk outside in the Atlanta heat to the designated ride share pickup area. At that point, as the ride share app would not let me choose a location for pickup until I was there, I had to wait another 10 minutes for the Lyft driver to come from their designated wait area. The drivers for the ride shares are also confused about where to pull in to pick up passengers and there was often traffic bottlenecks as folks loaded up. There were also about 100 riders waiting in the pickup area and this was at 8.30pm on a Monday night. The ordeal added at least 30 minutes to my arrival time and left me hot and angry.

One thing that caused me some stress was the fact that I received different answers from different personnel. Every time I've passed through the US in the past, I've always had to clear immigration with my baggage (i.e. collect baggage from the carousel, clear immigration, then drop off baggage again). As my baggage wasn't on the carousel, I asked a few airport personnel, who were all polite and friendly enough, but they all told me different things. Some said always collect your baggage, some said it wasn't necessary because of my final destination, some said my luggage must have been lost, and some said to check at the gate when boarding (which would have been too late at that point). My layover was 2hrs 25mins. I only arrived at the departure gate around 20 mins before scheduled departure time, which was 40 mins after they started boarding.

The TSA staff can clearly see the huge line, but refuse to open up more checkpoints/belts. Worse, the airport monitors continue to project a delusion that the wait time at all the checkpoints is less than 15 mins. I'm baffled how they could lie outright like that. Another issue is the belts for carry on screening. They have a bin system, wherein you have to fill up several and push them on to the belt. Leads to all sorts of confusion, and I've timed it and know for a fact that it's slower than the simple ""push through"" at most major airports.

Flying from Cancun to Atlanta, for a connection to London Heathrow, we were told on check-in in Cancan and multiple times on the Aircraft and on arrival in Atlanta that regardless of our destination we would have to claim our luggage from the baggage carousel and re-check it for the connection flight. Our flight from Cancun arrived at 6.30pm, with our connection flight boarding at 7.35pm, so already tight on time. When we got through customs we were pointed by an airport employee to the carousel from which we could collect our luggage. Super. What followed was a twenty minute wait before the carousel even began to move, time was slowly ticking away. A further 10-15 minutes was spent watching most others from our flight collect their bags and move on, but ours were no where to be seen. With 10 minutes to go until boarding the connection flight was to begin, I informed a baggage handler who told us (Myself and my wife) and two other couples catching the same connection flight (who had also not got their bags) to head to the gate, board, and take it up with the airline on arrival in London and they would arrange to have the luggage shipped to us which we reluctantly agreed to do. We then stood in a queue for another 30 minutes to pass through security, a process which I do not understand the necessity for as for those on connection flights we were not leaving the airport. By this point our flight was now well into boarding. At various stages when moving through the queue, myself and some others in the same situation addressed their concerns with airport staff, looking for reassurances that the baggage had been automatically transferred. Put simply, no one had a clue. Cue running through the airport, catching the small train to different departure gates, and more running as our names were called over the Airport tannoy system. Finally we made it, to board an aircraft full of annoyed looking fellow passengers who had been sat on board for some time. What I want to know is, why were we told on multiple occasions (and I'm talking 10-15 times) that regardless of our destination we were to collect our luggage, when in fact the whole time the airport had transferred it automatically? If this was a late decision, why did someone not make the effort to tell us? Why did no one at the airport have the slightest idea? The process of filtering people through to their connections is flawed and over complicated.

I've always cleared immigration/customs elsewhere, so I cant comment on that experience. Somethings have improved, others have gotten worse and many remain just awful as ever. The airport food choices have improved and its become a little easier to eat something ""healthy"" other than prepackaged salads. There are ample charging stations and there is now free wifi, although it is time limited. Shopping is now more upscale which some may find a plus - basically, its the kind of place one finds in other airports like Brook Brothers. Seating in the Delta gates has been revised to provide more individual seating, but it makes gates more awkward and provides less seating, overall. Security lines seem worse - back to where they were 10 years ago. TSA Precheck is available but one needs to ask about it and even then it's poorly signed and requires multiple questions to fins (it's off to the side in the South Concourse). The concourses are long and have no motorized walkways. Those who can walk have to dodge the motorized carts for those who can't walk. Delta still has no idea how to board a plane - they have more agents at the gate but no sense of team work. The merger with Northwest resulted in flight attendants doing their jobs rather than hiding in the galleys, but there's been no similar transformation at the gate, esp. here. And CNN remains inescapable, loud and dumber than ever. ATL remains an annoying airport to traverse with weak customer service and has become only slightly better as a place to kill time during the inevitable delays.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'December 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2015-08-29,7,10,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,Z Levenson,"US airports are run very differently to airports in Europe. Arrived into the International Terminal on Virgin Atlantic and had to go through customs and security (again). Be  aware that when arriving in on an international flight you have to claim your luggage and then give it in at the transfer area. We then had to get on the train in order to get to the other terminals/concourses. We transferred to Concourse B. Our outbound transfer in Atlanta was only an hour and a half but on the way back it was 5 hours so there was more time to explore this immense airport. A big surprise to me is when you board an aircraft. Often in the US they oversell a flight therefore some people may not get onto their flight. Another surprise was that passengers exited the aircraft into the shopping areas in the concourses instead of exiting into an arrivals area! This may be because the majority of passengers in Atlanta only transfer through it due to the low cost domestic US flights. On the way back we went straight to the new international terminal. I was surprised that there were only a handful of shops in this huge, brand new, state of the art terminal. Instead we went to Concourse E. We were told this is where the best shopping was and it was. It was like an enormous shopping centre with shops in each direction. There is a lack of restaurants at the airport due to the amount of fast food stands. Boarding for the international flight back to London could have been a bit more organised however I was satisfied with the service. Staff were adequate. Overall I would travel through Atlanta again and recommend it to anyone who is looking to connect to flights across the US.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2015-07-06,1,10,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,Amanda Farrell,"This airport was very frustrating! It is, in no way, wheelchair or stroller friendly. I was traveling with my infant son and I had him in a stroller. I departed from Atlanta and then later arrived in Atlanta. When I was departing I noticed the gates are very crowded and tight and no matter where you try to park a stroller or wheelchair you are going to be blocking a walkway or other seats. Also the bathrooms are very tight and constricted. This became very difficult upon my arrival back to Atlanta when the bathroom was busy and crowded. There is no changing station. So you have to use a counter which is not safe for infants as there is no way to strap my child down. Also the handicapped stalls are barely big enough to fit my stroller let alone myself in there with it. The elevators are not clearly marked and I had to walk around in circles looking for them. Not to mention they are small and barely big enough for one person and a stroller/wheelchair. There was a line of about 5 wheelchairs and 5 families with stollers waiting to use the only 2 available elevators. They need to update their airport in order to accomedate their customers.

2015-06-22,8,10,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport customer review,Michael Davies,"Arrival at the International terminal at 8pm on the British Airways flight from London. As we previously had visited the USA, had a valid ESTA and a machine readable passport we were able to use the passport machines. Quite straightforward and my wife and I were able to get clearance in the same transaction. A little tricky getting our finger prints in the correct position on the scanner. The machines printed out a form which we handed to the immigration agent. A few brief questions and a passport stamp and we were through. This was much the quicker route than traditional queuing. Bags arrived promptly and 30 minutes after getting off the plane we were standing at the taxi rank. Some airport hotels don't send their shuttles to the international terminal so we took a taxi to the Hampton Inn College Park. About $15 and well worth it. The alternative would be to take a shuttle to the domestic terminal and then wait for a hotel shuttle. A most pleasant arrival, we were having our first beer in a restaurant 60 minutes after arrival. Departure - Dropped off our car at the central rental centre. A shuttle bus took us to the international terminal. The bus arrived after 5 minutes waiting - but it was small and some people were left behind. We arrived at the terminal 3 hours before our flight at about 7pm and no queues at the BA check in desk and security was very quick. Didn't do any shopping and went upstairs to the food court. I cant say I was impressed. An expensive restaurant and 4-5 fast food outlets. Similar to a shopping mall but twice the price. My recommendation is to eat before you get to the airport if you want a good meal at reasonable prices. Fortunately, we were able to use the Club lounge. Boarding a little bit chaotic as a full flight and a lot of carry on luggage, that the gate agents put many bags in the hold.
