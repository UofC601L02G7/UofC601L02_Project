2016-05-25,8,10,"""comfortable waiting area and restaurant""",Ian Phllips,Arrival is a bit strange taxi wise because if you are single they want to find more people. Thought I was going to have to wait. Departure - American Airlines should add another kiosk as the kiosk was very slow. No TSA pre-check but they will give you an expedite notice. I have 2 artificial legs so always a trial for me. However must point out the security was definitely above average. Comfortable waiting area and restaurant. I did not eat there. This is a walk on tarmac airport.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
