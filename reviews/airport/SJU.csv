For the WiFi they try to get you to fill out a full survey with contact information. Also to make everything somehow even worse there isn’t any sort of usable map available online, simply states “food” for restaurant locations.

I then asked her in Spanish and she got irritated and told me no I don’t think so. Once I got to the counter the guy that check my bag was extremely rude with an attitude.

When they do work the water tastes like it came from a sewer. Since you have to dump liquids at security your only choice is to buy bottles of water. Two 16 oz bottles of Dasani are $8.96. That is obscene. Decent airports have water available in drinking fountains and refill stations for free. In addition to the obscene cost it is an environmental issue. We carry refillable Yeti bottles but the water is unfit for consumption. This opinion about the water quality is from a 20 year infantry US Marine who has drunk some pretty disgusting water.

I will never in my life go back through Puerto Rico or visit Puerto Rico, its such a shame the security screeners told me to go away.

I talked to 5 different people that were working at the airport and not a single one of them could help me. The lady for lost luggage area was super rude to me and told me she could not look after any of my bags so I could go look for my boyfriend. Then I talked to a luggage guy and he literally ignored me. Then I even talked to an airport security and he could not help me either. I thought this was a tourist airport but not a single person could help me or understand me. No one would even let me use a phone they had. I think this is messed up on so many levels because I spent so much money to fly here and I got lost and not a single person could help me. Imagine a child getting lost and people just ignoring him or her because they speak english only and don’t understand them, leaving them to fend for themselves,It’s sad and a very scary thing, I am now afraid to go back to San Juan airport because of my experience and it needs to be heard and something needs to be done about it.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

There are no proper breakfast places to be had at Terminal B. There was this over priced coffee shop, with prepackaged pastries, and prices that would make Starbucks blush, a Margaritaville, great if you are an alcoholic and wanted early morning booze, and a Viena restaurant offering chicken wings, burgers, hot dogs and meat patties, seriously?Not a single item containing eggs on site, yet alone any proper breakfast foods. I am really shocked they did not even have a McDonalds, Burger King or Mesón, heck, any restaurant known to offer real breakfast foods, it's really very disappointing that an airport this size cannot even provide sufficient and proper restaurant options. Hoy por la mañana salí de la terminal B, no comí afuera del aeropuerto, ni antes del control de seguridad pensando que encontraría un lugar apropiado para desayunar. Pero ocurrió todo lo contrario, un local de café, con precios más caros que un Starbucks, un restaurant tipo bar, en serio! Y el Viena vendiendo comidas de almuerzo, cena a las 5:30 am, en serio? No podían poner un Mesón, o hasta un McDonalds o Buerguer King, al menos esos ofrecen desayunos como Dios manda, y algo común y normal en cualquier restaurante del tamaño del LMN por todo el mundo, da vergüenza ver empanadillas, alitas, hot dogs o dulces en vez de comida verdadera de desayuno.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'September 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2014-07-27,3,10,San Juan Airport customer review,G Arce,I arrived yesterday at SJU. The airport looked clean but it has changed a lot since my visit last year. A lot of the eateries were removed so choices are few and far between. The biggest change is moving the car rental companies to a parking lot across the street. There are no shuttles to take you where the car rentals are. If you have a lot of luggage you are going to have to hire a baggage handler to take your luggage where the car rental companies are at. Even if you don't have a lot or no luggage at all you have to walk a significant distance to reach the car rental companies. There a no pick ups for the disabled if you have to go there you'll have to do that on your own power. When asked about it to the car rental person she said that the Mexicans that operate the airport changed it. This arrangement surely violates ADA if someone wants to push with the Federal government I think they should.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2013-11-18,5,10,San Juan Airport customer review,S Koenig,An older largely uncrowded airport that seems to have the facilities you'd expect of a small-to-mid-size domestic airport. While arrival was easy departure was a bit of a pain for us due to the complete absence of baggage carts on the arrivals level either at the curb or inside. No skycaps except in the baggage claim area. And no apparent curbside check-in facility. This was a big factor since you have to first take your bags to a Department of Agriculture inspection area to be scanned then take them to your airline's check-in counter then take them to the x-ray security station. Line for TSA security was relatively short. Selection of eateries inside security was fine. Note to airport authorities: put some darn carts at the curb on the arrivals area! Getting exercise is fine but when it's hot departing from SJU can be a pain.,,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

We have been flying international for 20 years and never had the delays lines disorganization that we had to go thru in San Juan. First a line for the Custom Check then collect our baggage then another line for another custom check. Walk 10 minutes to the connecting terminal to stand in line to re-check our baggage personally with the ticket counter (even though it was originally tagged/checked all the way through to our final destination) then one more TSA check get rid of all liquids. OK fine now if you wanted a bottle of water to take with you there was not one place to purchase it just run to your gate to be informed that we were late and they were kind enough to hold the door for us.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
