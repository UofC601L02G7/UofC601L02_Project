2011-04-16,5,10,Oklahoma City Airport customer review,R Childen,Excellent modern airport that is 2/3 complete. There was a complete redesign and now it consists of 2 concourses (West and Central) with the East Concourse still to be built. The facility is modern and airy and nicely designed for post 911 with lots of shops and restaurants post security. Presecurity it is very tight particularly because people waiting for arriving passengers congregate at the two TSA checkpoints (see CHOKE points). For the passenger flying into or out of OKC is a breeze.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
