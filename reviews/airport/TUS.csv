2013-06-09,8,10,Tucson Airport customer review,Rich Rosenthal,Pleasant smaller airport. Parking is easy as is dealing with rental cars if necessary. I've used both Tucson and Phoenix Airports (Phoenix had a direct flight and was less expensive) for traveling between Boston and Tucson. From now on I'll be using Tucson Airport due to the ease of access and human scale.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-09-20,1,10,Tucson Airport customer review,E Slick,As I checked in my bag I was surprised that I had to use a kiosk to check in. With all the employees standing around it would have been more efficient if they could actually help me. I was told by an indifferent male employee that it cost $25.00 to check in a bag. I was unpleasantly surprised but paid the fee. At security I was again met with employees that had bad attitudes and shoved me along quickly.,,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-07-12,4,10,Tucson Airport customer review,M Keenan,My recent experience of flying through Tuscon reminded me that in the contemporary climate flying through smaller American airports is generally a lot more pleasant than mega-airports. A case in point was the security screening – I have some metal in my leg that occasionally triggers the metal detector and it happened while going through security at Tuscon. The TSA person that dealt with me went through the standard procedure for dealing with this sort of thing (this wasn’t the first time for me) but they also managed to be human about it in stark contrast to what I’ve encountered at some other airports where the TSA person I was dealing with might as well have been a robot. I would agree that the dining options at Tuscon aren’t the greatest but I was still able to get something satisfying to eat. We even had some entertainment courtesy of the Arizona Air National Guard (also at Tuscon airport) who were doing training flights in their F-16s and treated us to an impromptu airshow. There is much to be said for flying through smaller airports – In general the experience is faster and less stressful than their larger equivalents.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-03-17,3,10,Tucson Airport customer review,J Kenner,Tucson International is a run-of-the-mill small regional US airport. The architecture is bright and airy and the Southwestern art motif is a nice touch. The security screening process moves a lot faster and more efficiently than most other US airports but the dining options are limited to low quality unhealthy food. TUS would do well to add a large sit-down restaurant/bar between the terminals that serves decent healthy food.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
