2024-08-29,2,10,"""absolutely worst experience"" ",LeRoy McDonald,"✅ Trip Verified |   I had the absolutely worst experience at Logan airport today (8-28-2024) First, we were in the security line when the scanners broke down. So, we had to leave the line and get into another line. Fine, this happens, so we move to the back of a different line. Then as we finally got to the point when it was our turn. Then an airport person comes with a wheelchair person and goes before us, no problem. Now it's our turn again, but then another airport person comes with someone else, not handicapped and the two of them just rudely walk right in front of us. No explanation. No ""sorry or ""excuse us"", nothing. Of course, at this point I am now tired of trying to get through this line, so I had said ""Excuse me"". The airport person started flipping her airport badge at me saying she can do anything with this badge. She was scary, and I was really taken aback by her attack. Instead of saying ""Sorry I needed to get this lady through security"", she started yelling that she could call security or the police on me. I was looking to the person that was in the process of taking our ID and she did not understand what was happening either. We were just grateful that this rude, person was walking away now. I probably should have called security on her right away but didn't. This incident really bothered me the rest of the day and I really regret that I did not get her name. This incident happened around 12:30 PM on 8/28/24 in the security line",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

There was no info desk. A bunch of us were confused. I flagged down a worker and he said to take the elevator up. No one on the elevator knew the airport. In Athens, there was a huge info desk. I went to the Delta sky lounge, which was packed and dirty. And the food unappetizing. Mac n cheese, pressed meat. Why can European airports offer baguettes and great salads? And South Korea and Singapore have live music, beautiful seating areas and lovely lounges with showers.

There was a long line - when an employee came over and questioned all of us in line where we were going. She was one of the rudest airline employees I’ve ever encountered. She actually engaged in an argument with someone standing in line. When I told her the kiosks weren’t operating properly and that I’d never done a bag drop off and could she help me, she just walked away. I started asking her another question, and someone just interrupted her - and she attended to him! My granddaughter and I were in line for over an hour - yes, lots of people had issues and were at the counter for half an hour - but someone could have created a line with people who didn’t have any issues - just a simple need of a ticket and checking in a bag.

One of the women's toilets had eight stalls, FOUR of which were either unflushed or blocked up! I reported this to someone cleaning another toilet, who was totally uninterested in doing anything about the problem. Everything in the airport looked battered and worn, basically as if not upgraded for, well, a millennium. It was a dump--an unsanitary dump.

I haven't flown through Terminal A in years but it still remains a very modern airport terminal. It is spacious with plenty of seating and dining options especially at Gates A12-121. There is a rather long underground walkway from these gates to the main terminal A. The walkway is beneath the tarmac and runways. We dined at Legal Seafoods before departure to DFW. Excellent food. The terminal was very busy given the snowstorm and delayed flights. Bathrooms were okay but could have been cleaner. WiFi was very fast and easy to connect too.

2023-10-18,5,10,"""the most unpredictable airport""",G Zach,"Not Verified |  Born and raised in the Northshore of Massachusetts, Logan is the only choice I have really when flying anywhere; domestic or international. My last experience at Logan was when I was traveling to Indianapolis with my partner to visit with his family back in July (2023). I've had both sides of the coin in terms of experiences with Logan over the years; really good experiences here with nice staff, everything being clean and organized to awful experiences where staff are rude, the bathrooms are gross, seating areas are dirty, disorderly queues and more. Both times going there ranged from fair to poor; bathrooms need serious cleaning and the interior needs an update & it looks like some areas haven't been swept or vacuumed in ages. The gap between great experiences and worst experiences at Logan Airport is one of the worst I've ever dealt with in my life. I feel like I have been going to Logan at the best times and the worst times and it is the sharpest gap between good and bad that I've ever witnessed. The airport in Indianapolis on the other hand is way better; way cleaner, way more organized, way more selections to choose from, etc. Logan Airport itself is not a bad airport, but overall there is better airports out there. Logan is in need of improvement though I wouldn't recommend it because there is such a sharp gap between the good and bad here; you may get the really good or the extremely bad. Better options out there. Sadly this is my only choice to travel. But to others: beware. You never know what you will get. Logan is the most unpredictable airport you'll ever witness.

The Immigration and TSA lines were the worst. We in line for hours waiting. Someone had vomited 3 times in the line and no one cleaned it up…disgusting! Agents were not friendly and were so slow. Once we left that area to pick our bags for a transfer for our next flight, that’s when we really hit hell. Long, long, ridiculous walks, no directions, no signs, no staff to assist. Never did find anyone at the Delta bag drop so once we entered Terminal A, the place was empty and cold plus only a few seats and we were stuck overnight with our luggage. Where are passengers suppose to wait? Airport hotel was way overpriced so we were forced to sleep on cold, dirty floor with obnoxious music playing. We’ve never, ever been to such a terrible airport.

The female officer was yelling at me to keep it out and things I didn’t understand. I didn’t know what to do and what they wanted me to do. It is not right to expect that everyone in the world speaks und understands perfect and fluent English. Specifically at an airport you can’t expect that. The staff should be kind and understanding, But they were rude and insensitive. Speaking as fast as a high speed train and I didn’t understand. Worst experience at a airport ever.

The persons that took the luggage was slow and checked her phone instead of doing her job. Going from this terminal to terminal A was a very long and confusing walk. I think the airport can do a better job directing people. I think the airport should find a shorter way for people that transfer from different flights.

No one understood the process, and when I put my luggage on the roller, he yelled, ""everything goes in a white bin!"" People where coming in to the line from two directions.

Where Logan fails, however, is with rental cars. The cars are all in a common garage, and getting there for me was a 20 minute ordeal on a standing room only bus. The rental counters seem to always be poorly staffed, so you end up in a long line to get your keys. Also, when you're trying to leave the airport you'll most likely end up going through one of the tunnels, which have tolls that can only be paid electronically. I bring my own EZ-Pass, but if you can't or don't do that you'll be forced to pay the rental car company's outrageous prices for toll transponders, and the same coming back to the airport. Finally, while there is now a gas station near car rental return, it is 65 cents a gallon higher than other stations in the neighborhood.

The bendy bus (Blue Line) was crowded and it took so much time loading luggage on and off. We eventually got to the car rental facility and rented our car. Drove to Maine. Had a great time. THEN, we returned to Boston to drop off the car and catch a flight on Jet Blue. This time, the Blue Line going from car rental to airport was even more of a disaster. Overcrowded (some guy brought a bike on board and was blocking the luggage rack), no announcements - is this Terminal A? B? Oh, it's still B? No, its C! Where are we? When we finally got through that morass, we got into the JetBlue check in area. We tagged our own bags. Then, we proceeded to wait in a very long cue to just drop our bags off. The conveyor belt was not working. The was a Sunday morning in August when everyone and their brother is traveling.

Logan Airport seems at first sight to be well organized for this - staff to direct you, electronic devices meant to speed up certain procedures, etc. However, there was a bottleneck situation the other day because 3 flights arrived at more or less the same time, and so it took all of 2 hours from the time I left the aircraft to the time I left the airport. This in and of itself is unacceptable, especially considering that it was mid afternoon and only about half of the posts were open. But even worse was the fact that many of the people in line with me were getting very nervous because they were afraid they would miss their connecting flights. However, when they asked if they could go through first, they were told it wasn't possible because everything had to be done on first come first served basis. The argument was that people who did not have connecting flights would protest and would never be served because in the meantime other flights would arrive. Not true because by the time I got through there were very few people still waiting in line. I for one would gladly let someone who is in a rush for a good reason go before me and I'm certain any sensible person would do the same. Other airports have staff available for the very purpose of directing people who have little time to catch their connecting flights. Why not Logan? It's a question of courtesy and common sense.

Way-finding signage after baggage transfer non-existent. Inquiries to uniformed police resulted in more misinformation sending us to locked doors, stairs without elevators and eventually walking outside to walk to terminal. Terminal design is terrible (as others have commented); but the simplest aides to overcome (signage and staffing). Because we were forced to go outside, had to go through TSA screening again; TSA staff were clustered together talking about their off-times and how long their hours were; and the few working were surly and slow.

It was a clear plastic wallet containing money, which I did not want exposed to public glare. I then found four trays of my belongings piling up at the end of the runners tipping over, being pushed by the following trays, risking my laptop, kindle and phone being sent crashing to the floor. I had to grab them and was left with an empty tray to get rid of, with nowhere to put it, and no staff offering to help. My reaction was to throw it back onto the runners as I felt I had no other choice, and the staff thought I was throwing it at them. I admit my reaction was not the best one, but I felt pushed into a corner by the staff doing nothing to help me and being rather aggressive. When I asked where I could go to sort my things out the answer was ""I dunno, get outta here"". Unhelpful, rude. This contrasts markedly with the courtesy, helpfulness, and friendliness of everybody else we have met in Boston, including strangers.

At this point, I was confused whether everyone had to wait in the same line whether or not you had checked luggage, and I asked two airport workers and neither could answer my questions, which was very frustrating.

The Customs official was just completely unnecessarily harsh and I would have been very happy to hang up if he had asked, but as I said goodbye, he yelled at me a second time, simply stating, ""NOW!""

We arrived at the airport two hours prior for a domestic flight. To start with, we were placed in an insanely long line by a TSA agent. Ten minutes later, we were pulled out of that line by another TSA agent and told to go to the back of an even longer line. When we told the agent that another TSA agent had put us in this line, her response was a curt, ""I don't care."" It took us well over an hour to get through security, then there was another ridiculously long line as they were scanning/checking bags. They had two scanners that were malfunctioning, and a bunch of employees basically standing around doing nothing. With all the security hassles, we barely made our flight with only 3 minutes to spare. All this after we showed up 2 hours beforehand!

Thankfully the line was not long when I arrived and I purchased extra speed check in through my airline because the TSA folks who were checking the bags in the X-ray machine were slower than I have ever experienced at any airport. There were at least 8 other tsa workers who were not doing anything, and did not assist the sole woman checking the bags. This equated to a 45 minute wait to get through X-ray and obtain my bags. Completely unacceptable. I had to run to my flight to make it as they were announcing my name over the loud speaker. I am lucky my flight waited for me.

2016-11-20,8,10,"""never had a problem with sufficient airport seating""",Bill Tarkulich,"Logan has been my home airport since 1980. Pretty much used every terminal. The airport is in a constant metamorphosis. Slowly each terminal is being remodeled, and then again remodeled. It's constrained by limited real estate and traffic patterns much like Washington National. There is is no comparison to the bad old days of 1980 when it was essentially a regional airport. However long one must walk, it's nothing like Philadelphia. I agree that a post-security people-mover type of shuttle between terminals for connecting flights. Boston is not a hub airport. I wouldn't think of making a connecting flight out of Logan. It's only recently they've begun real bona-fide international flights to Europe. Every international flight I've ever taken has me switching in Newark/NY. Many of the comments I've read here are terminal-specific. Services are vastly different from one terminal to the next. Don't broadbrush the whole airport. I've seen TSA shut down their lines when demand is low, but then open right back up when it surges. Seen this at many airports. When it is open, it never, ever takes me more than 5 minutes to get through, worst-case. Restaurant quality and quantity is greatly improved. Cooked food after airport security? Yes, there is, again, depending on the specific terminal. Up until last year, you needed to pay for wireless. That's changed. The inconvenience of 45 minute disconnect is a small price to say. Even still, the Rochester, NY wireless service beats Logan any day. I've never had a problem with airport staff. Be friendly, you'll get it back. Be a jerk, you'll probably get it back. Never had a problem with sufficient airport seating. They are slow to install power connections in or near the seats. Lack of toilets?

There is no internal people mover between terminals so one either has to go back outside and take a shuttle bus to the next terminal or walk a very long corridor between terminals. Then one must get in a long line and go through security again with very curt, rude security workers. Also, Logan does not accept the Global entry card except on Delta, not even for national pre-TSA. The terminal was so overheated, especially after coming off an international flight and having to go without water until I got through 2 long security lines with a long passage in between. I have medical problems such as heart arrhythmias and carry a cane for lupus arthritis, so these issues could have caused a medical emergency.

2016-11-08,1,10,"""one of the worse places to be stuck on a long layover""",S Carliner,"An embarrassing gateway and one of the worst airports for a layover. 1) Gateway: As is always the case when someone arrives from outside North America to a US port of entry, we had to claim our baggage. And in every other airport in the world, we would re-check it immediately after customs. But not in Boston. There was no baggage re-check desk for the Star Alliance nor was anyone who worked there aware of one. I asked one of the people in the recheck area what to do. She snarked that we had to take our baggage to the check-in desk in Terminal B. To put this in perspective, the gateway for international passengers is in Terminal E. Boston has no shuttle train between terminals and its bus stop is quite a bit away from the terminal and goes off-site to the T station before returning to the airport, so we had to walk it three quarters of the way around the not-so-small airport to get between terminals. It’s not the most straight-forward of walks between terminals: it goes inside and outside, up elevators, across parking garages—you get the picture. When we arrived at Terminal B, the airline staff member said, “Oh, we do have a drop over there.” I said it wasn’t marked and no one there knew about it. He snarked, “Well that’s the airport.” 2) Layover: If you like cramped waiting areas with 1 recharging station serving passengers at three gates inside the secure area, or visiting Dunkin Donuts stands whose staff desert them but fail to leave any indication that the place is closed or lounges whose servers who keep saying the other server will help you, then this is the place to hang out. But for the rest of us, the cramped conditions, lousy selection, lousier service, and lack of any suitable place to wait makes Logan one of the worse places to be stuck on a long layover between flights. When the layover occurs following an international flight to world-class airports in Europe and Asia that were designed for comfort and efficiency between flights, the conditions at Logan look all the worse. 3) Overall: After experiencing some of the efficient, pleasant, spacious gateways in Amsterdam, Helsinki, Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Copenhagen in recent months, my trip to Logan made me feel like I had gone back in time from the 21st to the 20th century. As a former Boston resident, I expect to find history in Boston-just not at the airport.

However, I was a tad taken aback when I passed the security checks - which were very quick, I must say - as the terminal looked too utilitarian and did not really make anyone feel comfortable or welcome. I did like the many electricity sockets available and the rocking chairs by the windows. Also, the screens all over the airport only show the flight numbers, times, airlines and terminal and do not show if the flight is boarding, for example.

Reached the airport pretty late and the first impression I got is - this is a a really busy airport, if an intercontinental flight is held for 1/2 an hour awaiting a (vacant) gate allocation. Arrivals experience was somber - after you live in the UK where there is a lot of hype and over the counter talk of small things - the airport - right from the moment I got off the aircraft - to CBP (Customs and Border Protection aka ""immigration"") was a very utilitarian experience. Very clean, well lit and well directed. Staff are on hand all the time so if you are dazed and don't really know what the heavens is going on (typically at the end of long haul flights) - they will direct you with minimal fuss. Toilets are clean - America has again, this no-frills attitude - you want to use a toilet, you get an american toilet - simple. CBP staff - interacted with two - one a native Italian speaker about 52 who tried his humanly best to welcome and wake me up - but my apologies was tired. The other one was the lady who checked us off and stamped our passports - no silly questions. It is refreshing to see immigration control in America so different to the one in UK and India - not a hint of arrogance, questions asked - all that was said was ""Welcome to America"" - this is something I will remember for a long, long time. Departures: Very nice departures area - clean, well kept and no complaints - might be handy with heating started a bit higher please. Check in at the BA desk was a 5 minute affair - American staff have a smile and again are utilitarian unlike the English examples in the UK. Security is a big thing in America - you drink all the water if this exceeds 100 milliliters, get scanned - pat down - all with a smile. There is a fair amount of ""duty free"" shopping there - something well laid out too. Catering is not great - if you are hungry please eat first and then check in - food is expensive, staff are surly and bored and food quantities would not be enough for a baby.

I arrived without checked bags, so getting from the aircraft to the rental car shuttle took a little time. There is one bus route to the rental car center and the buses run frequently. As a member of the frequent rental program for the rental company I used I was able to walk to the left of the rental counter queues and go straight to the parking area. My name was on the board and I was driving out less than ten minutes after I got off the bus. Departure from Logan to head north on I-93 is trivial and well sign posted. If you don't mind the added cost of 'renting' a toll pass they really make things easy and I would recommend making sure you have one. Boston is reputed to have bad traffic but even on a holiday weekend I had no trouble following the exit through the tunnels and on to I93 north. Returning to the airport it is easy to find from I93 south. There is a gas station in the airport, but since I have GPS I use a cheaper gas station near the airport. Without the GPS I'd just use the in airport station. Drop-off is easy again, just follow the sign off the ramp for your rental company and then take the elevator to the 1st floor to get the shuttle back to the airport. I flew with Jet Blue so there were loads of self check-in booths and it only took a minute to print my boarding pass. I had paid for extra room which comes with a shorter security queue. Airside for Jet Blue is pretty crowded at busy times but they have free WiFi and there is power on every seat in the waiting area. There are enough bathrooms and they are clean and well maintained.

The signage to the lot was so confusing that instead I ended up in the central parking garage. Signage from the garage to the US Air arrivals area in the terminal was similarly unedifying; I had to ask an employee for directions. Same thing to navigate the return to the garage.
