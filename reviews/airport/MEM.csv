2024-05-15,1,10,"""TSA claimed they were not responsible""",Carlos Quandros,"Not Verified |   Yesterday, 5/14/24, we arrived at Memphis airport at 4:55am for 6:05 am flight to Philadelphia. Upon receiving our boarding passes at the kiosk, we noticed a long line of at least 500 passengers waiting to pass through security. The line seemed endless, and we later found out that the airport only had four security checkpoints for over 12 flights scheduled to depart between 6am and 7:30am. When we inquired about the delay, TSA claimed they were not responsible, despite the airline attendant mentioning that TSA's understaffing had been an ongoing issue for morning flights. Due to the long wait, we missed our flight by 11 minutes and were rebooked on a connecting flight to Philly via Charlotte. Shockingly, 70 other passengers (fact) also missed their flight to Charlotte from Memphis. My advice to others is to arrive at least 2 1/2 hours early for flights departing from Memphis. The understaffed TSA seemed indifferent to the chaos, and there were confrontations in the line. Many latecomers appeared distressed, and there was even a member of the Memphis SWAT team present to maintain order before passengers entered the security checkpoint. Good luck! Side note: Huge shout out to Rejoice, the Gate Attendant at American Airlines, for having the patience of a SAINT and getting us on the next connecting flight to Charlotte!",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2023-03-27,2,10,"""Somebody needs to fix this place""",D Wilson,✅ Trip Verified | Great MEM airport. This airplane has been here for hours. We’ve been loaded for 30 minutes. Waiting for fuel. Apparently they only have one damned small fuel truck. He fuels a commuter jet and has to go back to the farm before he can do a second one. Fantastic. Crew had to wait 3 hours last night for fuel. Somebody needs to fix this place. Nice terminal but management and operations suck at their jobs.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Being a solo traveler with hidden disabilities, I am very pleased with the staff who were able to assist me. They were helpful and kind.

2020-07-21,3,10,"""Appalling Covid prevention measures""",S Rankin,"✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling Covid prevention measures at the airport. Crowding at security with new rules about food, slowing the process because of confusion about what needs to be removed . No social distancing guidelines at gate and no mask enforcement. People sit wherever they like and pull masks down. I am truly shocked at how Memphis airport operates at the times when there is a mandatory mask mandate in place, and all good businesses work toward social distancing. Would not recommend flying out of Memphis any time soon.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2016-10-07,10,10,"""service has always been pleasant""",Parth Mishra,"Memphis is always the city I depart whenever my family decides to go on a trip. The service has always been pleasant along with the low-cost airlines it has been adding, though, after the KLM flight to Amsterdam ended along with Delta dehubbing, Memphis, MEM, has been on a downslope with direct flight routes and still is. MEM urgently needs a new international flight, although I think MEM could potentially surpass the Delta/KLM days by its amazing service. Keep it up MEM.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'March 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2016-08-13,6,10,"""staff friendly and efficient""",A Karlsson,"✅ Verified Review |  Departure from Memphis. The airport was ok. I regard it as the best airport I experienced during my trip - much better than Newark (EWR) and better than Chicago O'Hare (ORD). The stores and restaurants was plentiful, but the airport is quite small. The staff was friendly and efficient. It was also quite clean, much better than the other airports I passed through this trip in the USA. It was easy to navigate through too. Many small airports are better than their reputation.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-10-13,10,10,Memphis Airport customer review,Simon Albury,his airport offers easy entry and exit for domestic flights but lacks a Priority Plus lounge.

2013-09-30,8,10,Memphis Airport customer review,Nigel Stacey,Having travelled through Memphis I found this airport very easy to pass through unlike a lot of American airports I will be travelling through again next week and know that it should be quite easy not only to land but depart back to the UK.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-08-19,5,10,Memphis Airport customer review,S Jones,First the positives! The most welcoming TSA staff I have encountered in the US. We arrived in Memphis so can't comment on facilities but ground transportation was efficient and it was easy to find a taxi. The most annoying thing was having to be screened on entry. We had already been screened in Norwich and Amsterdam but to be screened on arrival is over the top. Some people in the queue missed connecting flights as a result of this extra screening. I appreciate that we have to go through the terminal but if an airport deals with international flights then they need to review this and ensure that those departing in Memphis can leave without going through the terminal.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 0, 'Airport Shopping': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-06-02,3,10,Memphis Airport customer review,E Mabley,Memphis an ex-Northwest Airlines hub still exists as a hub for Delta post-merger with Northwest. For how much longer I can't say as it's close enough to Delta's fortress Atlanta hub to overlap the geographic area. The airport terminal was built in the 1960s and still retains the dingy poorly lit and low-ceilinged design of that time. The terminal piers are compact enough so as not to require long walks between connecting gates. Cleanliness leaves a bit to be desired. Food and beverage services are basic for U.S. airports but Corky's BBQ (an outstanding local chain) has 2 locations and is delicious.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
