2020-11-10,1,10,"""officer patrolling drop off was incredibly rude""",Caitlin Trubey,Not Verified |  The officer patrolling drop off was incredibly rude. I had two large bags and an Infant. My mother carried my daughter in for me while I checked my bag. There was no line so this didn’t take long. The officer started screaming about the truck demanding to know who it belong to and he said it was black so it didn’t register because it’s a deep navy blue. I was being helped at the desk and I said I’m nearly done it will be two seconds and he demanded now. I requested to speak with a supervisor who told me we were both wrong. I will avoid using this airport at all costs moving forward. No one deserves to be treated like that. I didn’t even get an opportunity to give my mother a hug goodbye. He knows who he is.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-09-08,7,10,"""simple and easy to navigate""",R Maccuswell,"Corpus Christi is fine small airport. In remarkably good shape and well kept. Very simple and easy to navigate. TSA security was a breeze, no lines and all staff were actually very firendly. Not much offering pre-security but couple of shops and restaurants post security. Easy to get to just west of downtown.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-03-21,5,10,Corpus Christi Airport customer review,Simon Channon,It looks like a white elephant but what an elegant one! Corpus Christi appears to handle only connecting flights to Dallas and Houston (that's the international bit) with just three airlines operating there. It is light bright airy and wonderfully free of the normal hustle and bustle of a modern airport. Checking in took three minutes; passport control and security about the same - they have new full body scanner. Each airline has its own gate complete with airbridge to connect even to small planes.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
