On the return trip layover, I made the mistake of stopping by a Mexican restaurant. The menu was limited and food tasted like re-heated frozen food. The layout is poorly thought-out. The queues for the airlines spill out into the walkway. Anytime a flight is about to take off, you are unable to pass through the area. Worth avoiding if possible.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Extremely discourteous. There is no valid security reason to inconvenience someone this way when there is a garbage can right there. They order everyone through in a hurried rush but apparently don't care about increasing traffic and passenger delay by doing this.

",D Jackson,Not Verified |  The baggage service for incoming international flights is deplorable. I thought I would try Oakland instead of SFO because it seems like it would be more efficient since it’s 1/8 of the size of San Francisco’s airport. No wonder. I have been through immigration and I’m still waiting for my bag an hour later. How ridiculous.

After clearing immigration at 5:15 there were no bags. It as 6pm before we exited the airport - 1:45 after landing! Someone wasn't doing their job. That delay for bags, on top of lack of gate capacity, is unacceptable service. This isn't a one off. Other family members had a similar experience on June 26 for the same flight where they waited 15 minutes for a gate again and weren't allowed to deplane for another 15 minutes due to a backup in the immigration hall. Departing OAK June 8 was another exercise in lack of airport capacity. Check-in took an hour. The gate had people sat on the floor everywhere due to lack of space for the size of the aircraft. OAK isn't equipped to handle the number and size if international flights currently using the airport. There are similar reviews from a year ago. Clearly Oakland Airport management don't care about customer service.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2017-10-27,9,10,"""arrival was amazingly quick""",Simon Fowler,"✅ Verified Review | We arrived and departed on the BA flight from LGW. Arrival was amazingly quick. It took less than half an hour to deplane, go through passport control and collect bags. Being a Club World passenger undoubtedly helped but even so we were pretty impressed. There was almost no queue to go through security at the time of departure (lunchtime midweek), so the process was painless. Again we were lucky that it was so quiet. A new business lounge has just opened by Gate 8. It's rather small, but has good food choice. Getting to San Francisco is a cinch using the BART connector shuttle to Coliseum and thence onwards to downtown San Francisco. In fact the whole experience is much better than at SFO. And because of the competition between BA and Norwegian fares from the UK are very reasonable at present.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Today, however, they've changed their queuing and the wait times are 30 minutes plus despite only about 100 people in line. Miultiple agents checking IDS at A-List queue with no one in line.

We were asked to remain in the airplane for an additional 45 mins due after landing to the delays in immigration. When we were finally allowed to deplane we then had an additional hour wait in the queue at immigration. Immigration itself does not make sense, one waits in line to go through the process at the machine and then waits another hour to have an individual stamp the passport. There were 3 officers tending to US citizens and another 3 to tend to non US passports. They need to employ more immigration officials! Oakland is trying to become another hub for SF, but cannot seem to get it right. We landed at 4.15 and received baggage at 6.30!

Typically, there are 2-5 immigration officers trying to get through a dreamliner with 200+ passengers.

2016-01-22,7,10,"""food options are limited""",David Davenport,"Oakland Airport is as convenient to San Francisco as SFO, especially now that the BART connector is open. There are good public bus connections too. The consolidated car rental facility is out of the way, but it isn't as bad as the one at LAS. OAK is much smaller and faster to use than SFO, so it is my preferred airport in the Bay Area. T1 and T2 are connected behind security, and both terminals have a spacious seating layout and plenty of restrooms. Security screening speed is variable but faster than SFO. Food options are limited, so it may be necessary to walk form T1 to T2 or vice versa to find something appetizing. There are interesting exhibits to peruse if stuck waiting for a delayed flight.

2015-06-15,6,10,Oakland Airport customer review,Thomas J Brodehl,"My wife and I have traveled internationally twice a year for the last 25 years. Then there are all the side trips in USA. Oakland is close and convenient to fly in and out of. However, no airport on earth takes as long to get your checked luggage from the plane to the baggage carousels. It has been like this for decades. We always sit in the back of the plane, therefore always the last ones off. Stop in terminal for a restroom break, then head down to baggage claim. The plane has already been at the gate for 15 minutes. This is not the biggest airport. When you arrive at baggage claim, you have a choice of 3 baggage carousels (Terminal 2, Southwest). None of the three carousel signs have your flight number on it. You stand in the crowd of people all looking from carousel to carousel to see if your flight number has shown up yet. Some flights can be 1/2 hour before your baggage hits the carousel after your flight arrives. No wonder everyone is jamming oversized carry ons into the airplane luggage bins.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-08-15,7,10,Oakland Airport customer review,M Estrella,Overall a pleasant experience. Terminal 2 is for Southwest and Terminal 1 is everyone else. Lines are as expected. Concessions are typical airport fare. Duty free did not appear to be a bargain and I will be thrilled when the AirBART bus is replaced by a rail connection to the BART station.

2013-02-05,4,10,Oakland Airport customer review,J Wasem,Don't stay over night in Oakland! We found a comfortable place to stay on a 6 hour over-night layover then security cleared the entire terminal.

Poor customer service in my opinion.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-08-14,7,10,Oakland Airport customer review,S King,Although older and with a more limited selection of flights than nearby SFO it is a decent airport and fare (on Southwest) from Ontario to Oakland was far less than into SFO. We used it just for one arrival so did not use check-in facilities restaurants etc. It did take some time for baggage to arrive at the carousel but whether this is normal we don't know. Information on transportation into San Francisco was a bit confusing. Getting to BART requires first taking a shuttle bus for $3 (?) per person. We ended up finding a shuttle bus into SF for about $45 for two people.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 0, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-01-28,9,10,Oakland Airport customer review,T May,I use this airport whenever I can over SFO. It's far cleaner and I've never seen a disgusting restroom. It is small security is a breeze and even with fog flights seem to take off on time. The restaurants are decently placed though expensive. It isn't a remarkable airport by any means the facilities are lacklustre there aren't a lot of outlets and it is nearly impossible to fly anywhere without Southwest or JetBlue and getting there without a car is nightmare. However it gets the job done staff are generally nicer the two terminals are never seriously crowded and the signage is great. If only all airports could be like this.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-01-04,2,10,Oakland Airport customer review,D Sedrick,I arrived yesterday on a fairly short hop from DIA. The baggage claim is a joke. There was no information displayed anywhere as to which carousel our bags would be on - for an hour! There is a screen displaying arriving flights which ours was not on. The only DIA flights were much later arrivals than ours. Very odd. Not only that but when we spoke to someone to try to find out where our luggage would show up there was only a shrug and explanation that it was busy. By the time we started looking at tags our bags showed up under an electronic board that showed a flight from Phoenix! No info on our flight showed up at all.,,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-11-08,4,10,Oakland Airport customer review,Ron Kuhlmann,In the past few years it has gone from being a vibrant and growing place to being a Southwest plus a few other flights kind of place. I took one of the two UA flights remaining and T1 is simply empty most of the time. It remains convenient for those of us in the East Bay but offers little selection for those in legacy mileage programs at this point.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2010-10-06,2,10,Oakland Airport customer review,John Clift,Flew in and out over this week Southwest terminal area much better than other side. Rental cars all in one place miles away and reached by ancient clapped out buses. Bart connection is a regular service bus and takes for ever. Hotel courtesy phones cover hardly any airport hotels and tourist / visitor desk is next to useless. Not a passenger friendly airport unless your arriving or departing by car. Handy location for east bay but apart from that not much going for it. Shame really.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
