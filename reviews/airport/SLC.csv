As construction continues there are not enough conveyors or ways to shorten the distances. For example, to make a connecting flight on Delta to a smaller airport, they require passengers to walk through long and steeply ramped tunnels (like hamster habitrails) to span between the actual terminal and a bus stop system. Passengers must be transported to a shuttle and then let out onto the tarmac to walk up another ramp to the plane. None of these spaces are heated. People with disabilities have to find assistance, and if you can locate help, the situation is still very difficult to manage. I walked more than a mile to go from my arriving gate in the far end of Terminal A to reach the plane gated at B30. I'm a senior citizen, in very good shape, but not everyone my age can walk that far in a hurry to depart on another flight. I live in a small city 200 miles to the north and will seriously consider driving instead of taking the Habitrail route next trip. In the old days the concourse for connecting flights was E and I thought it was like a Pit of Despair as it was noisy, not nearly enough seating, and forced passengers to walk long distances. This new terminal is worse on so many levels...still not enough seating, noisy, longer distances in unheated spaces, and just because they can... Delta had us walk to the very end of the bus Habitrail, past many closer gates that were not being used.

However, the experience has been incredibly and unexpectedly bad! First of all, humbly, jugging by my experience, I find it hard to believe that whomever designed the new SLC has ever been in an airport before. SLC is unbelievably the worst airport I've ever experienced in my over 1.5 million miles flown! A 25 minute power walk between security and the gates, really? The tunnel between A and B gates is too narrow for the passenger volume and out of the 3 escalators, 2 are for arriving passengers and 1 is for departing passengers. Here is a tip: It should be the other way around, departing passengers are more likely to have time constraints (such as getting to their gate so they don't miss their flight) than arriving ones. Then coming back it took SLC 1h 9 minutes to deliver my bags beating Madrid's 35 minutes and Paris CDG's little over 30 minutes. There are no seats by the baggage claim area, so plan to be standing for an hour while the bags travel from the gate to the baggage claim. -Finding your way out of the airport is challenging, especially if you're being picked up by a friend or family. I would say that the overall airport signage is the opposite of intuitive (just like in most European airports), but that's a far lesser issue given the other problems. At baggage claim I spoke with the airline staff, they were very nice and apologetic, but clearly frustrated with the airport design and management. They told me it's been like this since they've opened the new SLC in late 2020. Not sure if the SLC leadership reads these reviews or if they're even capable of realizing that maybe it's time to resign? Honestly, I've been in very poor countries and they have far better designed and run airports, costing far less than the $4.1 billion.

What a complete waste of money it was to spend $4.1 Billion on making everything worse than the old airport. 1) Entrance is big and airy but pointlessly so - a lot of utterly wasted space with very poor signage leaving you wondering where you should go. 2) Seating stations with strange stepped horizontals which are I'm guessing are supposed to mimic rock formations but are very expensive safety risks for any children. It is only a matter of time before they get sued relating to a fall from one of those silly designs. 3) Terminal A layout - you enter at one end (rather than central) to new Terminal A. This means it is a very long walk down a bland design large corridor that goes on for seemingly miles - and that is just Terminal A. Bad luck if your gate is at the far end. 4) If you are in terminal B then even worse news - you have at least a ten to fifteen minute walk underground to get there. If you are elderly or unwell then tough luck as there is no transport system. To add insult to injury the tunnel you walk through is awful and smells stale. 5) Pick-up arrangements by private car more or less just copy the inadequate old airport model and are hopelessly inadequate.

Aside from perhaps the Berlin airport, this is the worst airport I can think of. For starters, the signage is a complete wreck. Departure gate info is so hard to see from the car rental return that I missed it not once, but twice, wandering around. Next, they have about 25 state-of-the-art check-in lines which are usually at half capacity or less. But the real kicker is that the TSA precheck line is at the very end of the line and is the old “push your bags along the steel table” throwback from 20 years ago. If that isn’t bad enough, they allow anyone (precheck or not) through this line. So the precheck line is always the longest, because there is only one, it isn’t automated, and you always have 5 people ahead of you stripping off all their clothes because they got in the wrong line and the airport is too cowardly to redirect them to one of the 12 open lanes they should be in! Complete lack of supervisory control. Then, when you get to the terminal, there is seriously almost no places to eat or shop. I don’t know how to explain it. All that space and it’s just so poorly managed. Also it’s sterile. No character (unless you want to count a few hastily drawn murals in the basement). Ok. So I haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Here we go. The walk to B gate is unbearable. 20-25 minutes and I am not joking. And most of it is in the basement. Not a pleasant walk. But then when you get to your terminal and it’s time to board, they literally ignore all priority seating benefits and let everyone rush the podium at the same time. Then they lead you down a very long ramp to the tarmac. Then you are headed into a little tin shed that is not even weatherized. If it rains you get wet. If it snows, there is snow everywhere. Then you have to board a bus (I’m not kidding) and wait there while they cram you in. Then you drive alongside the runway for quite a distance. A plane was taking off next to us and we were literally choking on Exhaust fumes. Then finally we get to our plane and basically free-for-all boarding.

Also pre-Covid, I did a lot of business travel, 200K a year, and actually tried to go through SLC if an east-west layover was required, because it was a much more pleasant experience than Denver or Dallas. SLC was a great midsize airport. What happened? I’m seriously gobsmacked how thoroughly botched this new one is. I mean it’s clean and looks nice, but it’s a functional disaster that must have been designed by a walking fetishist. I saw a different review comparing this airport to Incheon and Hong Kong, which makes me think they’ve never been to those airports, because both have trams that get you close to where you need to go, have centralized shopping, lounges and food options, and have shapes not inspired by a giant equals sign. It’s like the designers looked at Detroit and Atlanta, and said, “That, but without the trains!” My personal story, discovering that my favorite east-west hub had been brutalized, was a on this most recent connection, my first trip since Covid. The plane parked away from the terminals next to a ramp, where a bus would get us. Not ideal, but whatever, I have been to airports under construction and this happens. We deplaned, and got on the bus. On arrival to the terminal, things started to unravel. You arrive to a structure that looks like a shrine to the world’s longest ramps that's connected to the end of Terminal B.

I don’t know how this thing is legal for either fire or ADA, because getting a wheelchair up this thing would be brutal, and if there’s a fire, there’s no escape. When I finished my climb, I then did what I always do, find the lounge. I used up about 20 minutes of my 90 minute layover with the bus and ramp, but still thought I had time to grab some breakfast. This turned out to be about as naive as thinking you can win a land war in Asia. I was at one end of Terminal B, and my connection was on the other end of Terminal B. I figured the lounge would be central like they usually are. Really should have looked at a map. I saw signage, and began to walk, and walk. Got to the opening to the tunnel to Terminal A, the signage indicated the lounge was on the other side, and I figured it must be central in Terminal A near the tunnel, so still doable. Ten minutes and a broken conveyor later, I get to Terminal A, and start following signage. Walking and walking. At this point I’m angry and committed. Turns out the lounge is at the very end of Terminal A, making it effectively useless for 3/4 of connecting traffic. I arrived 25 minutes after finishing the ramp hike, and scanned in for essentially a water break before my return journey to the connection that I now knew was a mile away. I arrived to my connection sweating through my shirt and angry, with my phone congratulating me for power walking nearly three miles. I understand this airport is a work in progress, but anyone who thought opening the airport in this state is negligent. I don’t know how anyone with mobility issues or children could do it without severe distress. Considering the money involved, it’s borderline criminal.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

It's almost like they took everything good about the last airport (and there was a lot of good) and tried to do the opposite. Starting with something the old airport struggled with, pickup and drop-off. The old airport was almost always packed and difficult to deal with, so what was their solution? Make less space to pickup and drop-off...brilliant!! Off to a great start! Now let's take something the old airport did well and completely butcher it. You had very little distance to walk with the old airport because you had two terminals with separate security lines (three if you count the international terminal, it was a genius layout). This new airport has one security line and then once you're in the terminal, you start all the way at the end of a quarter mile (at least) corridor. Then if you want to get to the next terminal, you have to walk halfway down the first, then another 1/8th of a mile under the tarmac, then walk all the way down to wherever your gate is. I mean, it's laughable how poorly it is designed. Especially given that most people in Utah have a ton of kids. I only have two (very) young kids and it is a nightmare to get luggage and kids from the drop off area all the way to the gate.

This was the least friendly airport for its patrons that I have ever been in, and I have traveled a lot. I was excited to try out the new airport since I'd heard so many things about how streamlined and efficient it would be. That is absolutely not the case. When we first departed from the airport, I was very disappointed with how humongous it is, with no concessions for people to move through it easily (except a few slow moving walkways). It is so large it's difficult to get from one place to another, and it takes forever to get anywhere. It seems as if you're walking for miles before you get to your destination, and the signage is not clear, you're not sure where to go. It was a disappointing experience. However, our return experience was even worse! We are 65 and 70 years old. Although we're on the older side, we're in pretty good shape, having just returned from a dive trip. After traveling all day and being worn out from travel, we thought we were going to die of exhaustion before we got out of there. I'm sure we must have walked over two miles just to get out! I have a bad right hip which is usually manageable, but after walking and walking and walking, and walking some more, I thought I was going to die before I got out of there. There are no accommodations for those with health difficulties - how did they ever pass ADA regulations? I didn't see one vehicle that could move elderly or disabled people from one place to another. The design is horrendous - it is so spread out, it's definitely not conducive to anyone that has difficulties ambulating. There is no tram system, as is used in most other airports to move people from one section of the airport to another. Although there is a place for a future tram, it needs to be put in place immediately, not years down the road. And, the way it's laid out, I'm not sure it will decrease the walk time for the patrons. Who designed this thing, and did the city actually sign off on the design? Did they not care about whether it was doable for its patrons? Obviously, no one thought about those that cannot easily walk several miles. And, they have cast the parking shuttles into outer darkness, probably to benefit themselves and their own parking garage. After picking up baggage, you used to be able to walk out the door and pick up the parking shuttles. Now, after walking through the whole airport, you then have to walk another half mile to get to the outside rim of the parking lot to a small designated spot for the parking shuttles. It appears they're trying to drive them out of business and inconvenience their customers! It is really a travesty!

2021-04-12,3,10,"""how is this even legal""",Ian Christensen,"Not Verified |  In an age of project planning, focus groups, and ADA, how is this even legal. Appalling. When I got on the departing flight, a young guy said to the person sitting next to him, ""How many times do you think we've heard the word 'ridiculous' in the last 45 minutes?"" I like to walk, and I didn't have a bag, so my concerns are for those with heavy backpacks, small children, the aged, the unfit, and those on tight schedules. I pity anyone who has more than one of those factors. After a shocking experience departing the airport, I decided to start my pedometer on the airplane when arriving at gate B8, which is not the most distant gate. You could very easily add another .25 miles to the number I'm about to share if you had a B25 gate, or similar. I started my pedometer when I got off the plane to see how far it was to the long-term parking shuttles. It clocked in right at .75 miles. (So if you had a B25 gate, for example, it would be over a mile, I think.) A few other factors to into it to make it better and worse than it sounds. 1) I didn't use any of the moving walkways last night, one of which wasn't working, anyway (at a brand new airport - it had an out of order sign). I did that for two reasons: to measure and also because no one stays to the right on the walkways so you can pass, because they're all so tired of walking. That means that the moving walkways actually slow down the sense of progress you feel you're making on the sojourn. 2) On the escalators, no one walks them, either (for the same reason), so you just have to stand there. Standing actually tires me more, and it's a little frustrating if you're in a hurry. The escalators serve a necessary purpose, though - you probably wouldn't want to opt for the stairs (stair steps, by the way, would add to the length I tracked). You're going under the tarmac above you, and the escalators cover a pretty significant drop and climb. Again, the escalator (and moving sidewalk) could either give you a sense of rest or drive you crazy because they poke along and no one moves on them. If you're in a hurry, you're pretty stuck or you'll need to break a sweat and do the stairs twice (down and up on the other side). 3) There was not a long TSA line, but the wait was still lengthy. The tray system is now automated, but it doesn't speed things up. I think it slows it down. Back in the day, a human being could remove trays and take them back to the front, now they have to be left on the belt to be collected at the end, and the belt isn't very long and there's no place but at the belt to pull your stuff off (often to put it on again). The way they file the people through and screen the trays, the trays and people conning through aren't in the same order--not even close to it (which has always been the case to some degree, but it is way worse now). So TSA will either give you the impression of being able to take a breather or it will ultimately add to the length of your airport marathon. A few other random gripes are that even that strange, white fabric wave art installation (which didn't appear to be working) is an extension of the utter lack of practical planning this entire airport disaster represents. The airport is barely six months old, and it already looks dingy from airplane exhaust. Whoever thought that was a good idea? I remember the lack of cleanability was something observers talked about from day one. The added time makes driving to surrounding states seem better.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2021-04-01,7,10,"""SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles""",W James,"✅ Trip Verified | SLC is a sterling, world-class airport, with some wrinkles. To begin, I absolutely do not understand the onslaught of negative reviews for the newly-completed (and still under-construction) SLC redo. The only explanation I can think of is that those negative reviews are from people driving in from some place like Magna, West Valley, Brigham City, or Wendover who just don't like big cities and big changes. Let me start with the positives of the new SLC, and there are many: 1) TSA staff who are helpful, polite, and explanatory, who don't bark orders officiously, and who efficiently process passengers. The best TSA I've encountered in almost any airport in the USA, except possibly some small airports like Lexington. 2) Architecturally stunning, post-contemporary, and a generally relaxing, open-air design; the closest thing I've seen in the USA to a Seoul Incheon, Hong Kong, and Sydney's Kingsford Smith (though those airports are even more beautiful). 3) Countless art displays in the terminal, completed concourses, and the underground walkway connecting the concourses at present. 4) Dining and shopping options in the Delta concourse (A). 5) Ample displays and signage, from the time you leave I-80 or North Temple to the time you arrive at your gate. 6) Luggage carts prominently located at the entry to the terminal (although you have to pay for them, and I don't like that we have to do that at US airports in general when you don't always have to in other countries). 7) Accessibility by highway, TRAX light rail, or rideshare is a breeze. 8) It's close to downtown, and still a 45-minute drive from Park City, Antelope Island, etc. 9) The restrooms (men's anyway) have stalls which afford full privacy, common in western Europe and wealthier Asian countries but rare in the US. Now, there are some drawbacks that will need to be worked out: 1) There really needs to be significantly improved accessibility between the terminal, baggage claim and concourses, hopefully the new tunnel under construction will remedy that, but there is no excuse for this airport to not already have an active tram. However, despite the naysayers' reviews, it takes 15 minutes to walk across the airport, not 30 minutes. 2) The food and dining options in concourse B (Alaska, Frontier, Southwest, etc.) could stand to be more numerous. I'll also say that while Uinta Brewing is a great place for a locally-brewed beer, they could stand some competition, as the service frankly wasn't very attentive or friendly. 3) The Southwest personnel weren't very friendly, though at least they weren't rude or hostile like I've experienced from SWA at other airports. 4) If you want to rent a car from SLC, you'll be paying a ridiculous airport surcharge of some kind, I took an Uber to and from Millcreek to rent a car. Even considering the cost of Uber, I still saved $80-100 rather than renting at the airport. I noticed that the rental car facilities from Farmington all the way down to Sandy were almost entirely booked, but the airport still had rental cars available. This is an obvious problem. 5) The WiFI is terrible and needs to actually be accessible for passengers. So, wonderful job overall, SLC! In fact, I'm impressed. Just work out your wrinkles, always find ways to improve and execute plans of action, and you can complete with the very best in Europe and even some in east Asia!",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'March 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Those shuttles are no longer permitted to drop passengers off at the main doors. Instead they are dropped off downstairs, outside and made to trek completely through the car rental parking lots and up escalators to check in. Hotel shuttles are permitted to drop off at the main doors so why not off site shuttles?. Let's see - could it be that airport officials are trying to force passengers to pay their outrageous rates to park in their long term lots?

Unless you happen to be in terminal A in some of the first gates, get ready to walk and walk and walk. In the design they did not include enough escalators and so both arriving and departing you queue to get on the escalator. Also, if you are in terminal B, you need to traverse under the tarmac. This is an incredibly long walk for an airport of this size - they state 7 minutes. Also, they oriented the entry to the airport at the end of terminal A instead of the middle. So for 3/4ths of the gates, get ready to walk. Also, terminal B, there are few amenities vs terminal A. Finally, for baggage claim, you need to commit to walk to one side or the other to see the posted bag claims for your flight. They should have signage before you have to commit to one side or another, otherwise you have to back track. Just feels like they could have accomplished all this with half the footprint. With all of the airport experience around the works, it is impossible to believe this airport could have been this poorly designed.

There is barely enough room for the sideview mirrors to clear. Access to the ramps requires sharp almost impossible to make turns from the aisles. Even getting a ticket from the kiosk is challenging and the same is true for paying as one leaves. There is not enough room for two cars going opposite directions to pass in any of the aisles and backing out of a parking space without hitting the car parked opposite requires expertise in multi-point turning.

2021-03-16,1,10,"""avoid SLC international like the plague!""",C J Kotrodimos,"Not Verified |  I'm glad to see it's not only me who really, really dislikes the new SLC International Airport. I've used an off-site parking lot/shuttle for years. The shuttles used to be able to drop you off and pick you up in front of the terminal. Now, the parking shuttles cannot get any closer than the parking garage. I'm guessing this is so you'll use official airport parking the next time you travel. With all your luggage, you must now walk for about 5-minutes, through the parking garage and then take an escalator or elevator to the next level. You're protected from rain or snow, but not heat or freezing cold temperatures. If you're flying Delta, you get to check in on that level. But if you're on another airline, you must take yet another elevator or escalator up to the top floor. I had a 28-inch bag to check in and a 21-inch carry-on. The larger bag got caught on a step while ascending, tipped back, and pinned me on my back, as the escalator moved upward. I was barely able to stand up before reaching the end of the escalator. During my weeklong vacation, I felt like I had a broken rib from the fall and had so many bruises, I was embarrassed to wear shorts. After checking my bag on the top level, I had to go back down a level to get to my gate. The terminals are now shaped like a giant T, but with 2 top crosses. Again, if you're on Delta, not so bad. All Delta gates are in concourse A. But to get to a non-Delta gate, you must take a very long tunnel to get to concourse B. Both the A and B concourses are linear and very long. It takes over 20 minutes to get from security to the very end of the B concourse! Just like on the freeway, there are digital signs telling you how long it will take to get to your gate. Thanks a lot. If it's a 15-minute walk and you only have 5-minutes to catch your flight, you're out of luck! Even with the ""walking escalators"" it's an extremely long walk, especially wearing a mask. The airport says it's adding a second tunnel to shorten the walk, but the tunnels are not going to be far enough apart to make a difference! If they wanted two parallel and linear concourses, they should have had parking, entrances, and TSA checkpoints on each side. I understand that SLC is a Delta hub. But if you're on another airline, you feel like you're being punished for not paying twice as much for a Delta ticket! If you're changing planes in SLC, make sure you have a minimum of 90-minutes between connections. If you arrive at the northwest end of concourse B and your next flight is leaving from the southeast end of concourse A, make sure you have running shoes on! I design buildings for a living. Not airports, but large hospitals. I love change! Especially in architecture. This design is horrible! Not well thought out at all! At least in Atlanta, you have the ""plane train"" to get you to the other end of the airport. How did someone not see this as a problem? Lots of people in SLC have lots of kids. Have fun carrying your little ones when he or she gets too tired to walk. Sure, the new airport looks nice, but it's awful to use!

It's literally a mile of walking each way. Did the design get awarded to the lowest bidder?! Upon arrival and departure on my United flights, I/we had to walk over a mile to/from security to the gate, which only boarded you on to a ramp to get on a bus that took you to/from the plane a half mile away on the tarmac. If I was on the board of United, Southwest, American, etc. I would be up in arms about this lack of competent design flow for my paying customers. Calling it a work in progress is a cop out for a really poorly thought out concept. I've been flying in/out of SLC for 3 decades, and I am in awe that this was allowed to move forward like this. It's a significant step backward. The aesthetics of the main terminal are nice and interesting, but it's a small consolation for its poor layout. The murals on the south half of the underground walkway from concourse A to B are nice with the seasons of Utah being depicted, but the North half looks like it got awarded to a middle school in the district. Given all the revenue dumped into this project, I am left scratching my head that this concept moved through as many levels of review necessary for this type of new construction, and no one raised the very legitimate point of ease of use by their customers.

Allowing people both to stand and walk without hitting bags or feeling like you are pushed to the side. And seating, who cares about the wonderful silhouettes of the canyons, people need comfortable places to sit, especially when they need to rest after walking from one end of the terminal to the baggage claim. And for baggage claim, again, not enough signs to find the right baggage claim.

Customer experience was never a consideration. I had high hopes for the new modernized airport as I travel out of SLC several times a month. Let's start with parking. Economy lot is exactly the same except the busses are running slower. Parking garage is about the same but less convenient now. Skycap is missing. WiFi is still slow and terrible. The long walk to terminal B for absolutely no good reason at all. Prepare for a hike, bring running shoes, water etc. Just remember to enjoy the gigantic, over-sized ""artwork"" on the walls of the terminal. They cut budget for a tram but the costly sculptures remain. Enjoy! Entrance - worse, like everything else. Be prepared to visit all 3 floors just to catch a flight. You might arrive at street level, up to level 3 to check in then back down to level 2 for TSA and to the gates. Whoever designed the airport was definitely buddies with the escalator company. Complete with people dragging their bags and kids up and down escalators because the airport was not designed for customers. They severely overlooked the importance of the entrance and check-in process. TSA - Worse, slower. Newer does not mean faster when it comes to the TSA. New bins are terrible, slow and there's a good chance your bin comes out the other side without everything you put in it! Watching the TSA poke around the machine with their stick, trying to find lost items is kind of amusing when it's not my item. Food - Less choices. The same restaurants as before like Squatters but got rid of the cheap stuff and fast food. I enjoy the nicer restaurants but sometimes just need something quick and cheap. Not enough coffee shops, not enough anything. The new strip of designer stores are a fail, empty or nearly empty every time I've walked by. Trying to have a mini-mall instead of more food options serves nobody. Prices in the convenience stores have gone up considerably. The good, barely. Pickup area is bigger. Previously, the lanes were sandwiched between the terminal and parking garage and could never be expanded. Same design but starting out bigger and should be adequate for now. Sitting areas not near the gates are larger, more spaced out and have plenty of electrical outlets and charge ports.

It is a more aesthetically pleasing airport than its predecessor, but the outdated predecessor was 10 times more functional. Security screening should be on the same level as airline check in as that seems to be the worldwide norm. Instead, you check in then immediately have to ride an escalator or elevator to security screening area. Guess what, security screening is located right where all the arriving passengers have to claim their luggage! Brilliant. Speaking of claiming your luggage, there is one thing that was brought over from the predecessor, the infamous luggage destroyer carousels. It’s 2021 and there are much better designs than the drop and crash luggage destroyer. Look it up, Nashville, Fort Lauderdale, even JFK have no dump and destroy carousels. Oh and after you claim your bags, you have to cross the sky bridge and then ride and escalator or elevator to get to the street pick up. Here’s an idea, put baggage claim on ground level. Don’t worry, I haven’t forgotten about the insane length of time it takes to get to the B gates and how they couldn’t figure out how to line up the connector with the main entry corridor. Obviously this airport was designed by a person who had a vested interest in escalator, elevator and moving walkway sales and installation as I find it difficult to believe any reasonably intelligent person could not figure out some of these challenges before this design was approved. Here’s an idea, get input from the traveling public, you know the people who actually pay for and use the facility.

Our plane literally parked way out on the tarmac somewhere. We had to walk outside the plane down a ramp (in winter) to a shuttle bus. The bus drove us to B gates—which is nowhere near the baggage claim. 3/4 of a mile walk later around the entire airport I finally got to baggage claim. Got my bag and the signage that used to be so clear about where to get ground transportation didn’t exist anymore. I went out a door for shuttles, and had to ask a Trax bus driver where the Economy shuttle line was. She directed me to 6c which was further down. Who designs an airport like this? It’s a giant U, and no one thought “hey—how about a connecting tram between the gates? It’s insane. God forbid I had a connecting flight to make. Even so—it was practically an asthma attack just to get from the tarmac to my bag. And one of the walkways in the opposite directions wasn’t even working. I felt so bad for those people.

Had I known that I would be forced to walk for more than 45 minutes with a carry-on shoulder bag, I would have carried-on a roller bag. Next time, for sure. The signage was unclear: the moving walkways appeared to be going to A terminal and the baggage claim sign to the left suggested that one should walk on the left side where there were no moving walkways. When I figured out that I could go on a moving walkway, the last one ended and a left turn toward baggage claim presented a further long walk with no moving walkways. Also, the moving walkways were jammed: no social distancing and no airport attendants to make certain that would happen. The thoughts I wrestled with were that I am older but fortunately in good health. If I had not been and had a heart condition as do many of my age, I might have suffered a heart attack from the length of the walk and having to carry a bag. And I feared exposure to Covid on the jammed moving walkways and escalators. Thirdly, I wondered how far I would have had to walk in a short time, had I been making a connection. Finally, after retrieving my luggage, I stopped a bicycle-riding SLC policeman to ask how to go to passenger pick up and he looked at me with two large suitcases and brusquely said ""go up those stairs over there."" Right. I like to be supportive of police, but that was the unkindest cut of all. I would like to say that I would avoid SLC in the future, but I live in Jackson Hole and every trip I take must go through Salt Lake. In an era of technological advance and sophistication, what idiots designed the new airport?

I always look forward to experiencing a new airport or sizable expansion, such as SLC has recently undergone. Unfortunately, there are too many problems with the new facility to enumerate. The remote (as in feels like you are in the next county) nature of the B terminal is particularly troublesome. On arrival in terminal B, the single down escalator designed to give access to the pedestrian tunnel to terminal A was out of service. There was no ongoing effort to repair the equipment nor any effort made by airport personnel to advise travelers of the situation—just a huge “traffic jam” (btw, interesting social experiment—social distancing immediately collapsed, health is apparently less important than getting ahead). I agree wholeheartedly with those who wonder if those who designed and executed the expansion actually travel regularly. Travelers beware: If you have a right connection you are likely to miss it, particularly if it in involves a terminal transfer. There are certain airports I have avoided for years.

There are moving walkways - 4, to be exact - that are very, very far apart, and there is nowhere for a handicapped person to sit and rest between those walkways. Everything is very clean and sanitized - with nowhere to rest. There are no kiosks in the concourse with airport maps showing what stores are available within that long concourse, either, so if you're looking for something, you have to physically re-walk that long, long concourse. On one of those walkways, I spied a food place with a few blocked-off tables, but nothing like at PDX or SeaTac or O'Hare. There are very few places to eat, anyway - so maybe that is why they don't bother with kiosks. Once out of the concourse and past the security doors, there are multiple ""island"" features where one can sit and get a breath, which is a good thing, because it is another long, long walk to get to baggage claims - which is another long problem. There are two sets of carousels - one to the left of the security exit, and one to the right. Neither is clearly marked overhead, but one is for Delta, the other for all other carriers. The video screens to tell you where your luggage will be are both a long way from where you first see them - so you have to walk hundreds of feet - only to find out you should have gone the other way. Then, I had to pass four empty, unused carousels to get to my luggage. So then, I could finally leave the terminal and go out to my waiting daughter. Except: When you leave the terminal, you are in the area for shuttles. You walk to one of two crosswalks, and get to the area for Uber and Lyft vehicles. Then you find that there is a concrete wall between you and the place passenger cars can pick you up, so you get to go back across the shuttle area, back in the terminal, up to the second floor, across those lanes and back down to the ground to get out where you can be picked up. All in all, it was a miserable experience. I have been in hundreds of airports around the world. I have never had such a miserable experience.

From what I saw, there is only one checkpoint for the entire airport, which could cause long lines during the busy time. We were departing in the late evening, and the line seemed to be about 10-15 minutes long, while the TSA-Pre and priority lanes were completely empty. The security equipment was brand new, and the process went smoothly until I was selected for an additional security check due to my arm brace. The agent was quite rude and forcefully patted down the brace and caused pain after collecting three substance samples and two hand metal detector tests. Additionally, the same agent flipped everything out of one of our suitcases to confiscate a bottle of lotion that was 5 millilitres over the limit and has passed through multiple airports before. Past security, there were a few restaurants like Shake Shack and only one lounge, the Delta SkyClub. Most stores are still under construction. The A gates, which are used by Delta are located within a few minutes of walking distance. However, all other airlines depart from the B gates, which require all passengers to once again go one level lower and walk for quite a large amount of time. The B gates do have restaurants, however, the best options are closer to the entrance of the airport at the A gates. The wifi worked well and all seats were equipped with a power outlet.

After my recent experience at the ""new"" airport, I will be looking for a new western USA base. Simply put, I honestly cannot think of anything positive to say about this new airport. The new parking garage is a mess. The signage is quite poor. I wanted to park my rental car in the short term area as I have always done. But when I pulled up the ramp, there were two ways I could go: the left-hand ramp went up, so I took the right-hand entrance. The garage is very poorly designed. The entrances to the garage are VERY narrow, and you have to enter on a right-angle, which made things very tricky. Fortunately I had a very small car, but it was a tight squeeze even so. Once I got into Level Two, I saw a sign stating that overnight parking was not permitted. I drove around for a least 5 minutes, trying to find either someone to help me or the way up to Level Three. There WAS a booth that said ""Information"" but no one was around. So I drove around for another 5 minutes, trying to find the exit. There are signs pointing to ""exit"" but in fact many of them just lead right back into the same level! When I finally DID find the exit, it was unmarked, off to the side in an odd location, and not only did it require a 90-degree turn, but there was a long concrete barrier about six inches high alongside the exit. I couldn't pull into it, so I had to go all the way around and then swing wide. As it was, it was a VERY tight lane, as was the entrance to the down ramp. When I finally got to the exit, I asked the lady at the ticket booth where I could park overnight. She told me to go left, up to Level Three, and that she would immediately call her supervisor, who would meet me at the entrance, to help me. Needless to say, no one up there on Level 3 either. When I got down to the check-in area, it was absolute chaos. Long lines to get a baggage tag, even longer lines to drop the bag off: and the counters were fully staffed. The chaos was not the fault of the airline, but rather the poor airport design. Very poorly laid-out and definitely not customer friendly. I asked the lady at check-in how I was to get to my gate. She said, ""you're at B20"" and that's a bit of a walk: 1.2 miles, actually."" As it turned out it was even further than that! Another airport employee told me later that they were going to build an underground train to connect Terminals A and B, but had no idea if/when that would actually be completed. Several of the rolling walkways were also not functioning. I felt sorry for the older people that I saw that were clearly struggling with that hike. The signage throughout the airport is poor. For example, to get to Terminal B from Terminal A, you have to walk halfway down Terminal A, then take the stairs (or escalators, if they're working) down to the tunnel that leads to B. One would think that this would be frequently signposted but in fact it is not. I wandered around for quite a while before I stumbled upon it. Returning to SLC was more of the same. There are a few signs for ""Baggage Claim"" and then they suddenly disappear. Again, a fair bit of wandering and I finally found: right at the entrance to Terminal A! Not secure at all.

It is gorgeous to be sure. But you have to walk through the entire Delta concourse before taking a very long underground tunnel to the second concourse where every other airline is housed. That underground tunnel is 50% longer than the tunnel at O'Hare between the two United concourses. To get to a Southwest or United gate is a solid 20 minute walk (approx. 1 mile) both when you depart and when you arrive. The ""everybody but Delta"" concourse also has very little food. It is as if Delta decided to punish every traveler who was not flying Delta with an extra 20 minutes of walking time, both arriving and departing. The tunnel to the second concourse could easily have been placed at the front of the Delta concourse instead of the back. Forcing someone to walk the entire length of the Delta concourse before having to then walk the entire length of the second concourse is punitive - I can't think of another word for it. Shame on Delta. Shame on the SLC airport authority. It used to be a delight to fly in and out of the SLC airport.

The regional and state governments there seem to understand that that not only improves the quality of life for the residents, but it also provides a wonderful aspect for people who are tourists or doing business in the area. That said, here are the airport's strong suits: 1) Signage to wherever you need to go, whether in the terminal, at check-in, or driving into or away from the airport, is usually ample and straightforward. 2) The airport is generally clean, with the major exception of a few gates in an older terminal whose remodel still isn't yet complete (in that case, that particular area I saw was actually pretty dirty). 3) Renting a car, returning a rental car, or taking light rail from and to the airport are all pretty easy (at least Enterprise Rent-A-Car was easy). 4) I don't remember ever meeting even a grumpy or gruff person working at this airport, even TSA, in my experience, were all business with their security monitoring, but courteous and efficient. If you have TSA Pre-Check, that always helps. 5) The exterior of the new terminal under construction as part of the remodeling process conveys SLC's ambition to be an even more modern, more ambitious, and more traveler-friendly metropolis. 6) I still find it hilariously ironic that there are direct flights between SLC and Amsterdam, considering the stereotypes of those regions. Now, for a real con, the present construction work has resulted in some lane changes driving around the airport that require the driver to pay close attention, or else miss their exit or turn or just crash into some concrete barrier.

The company we reserved with had no cars available period and only vaguely suggested we might get one after several hours.

2011-04-27,4,10,Salt Lake City Airport customer review,M McManus,Arrived from Denver for a day trip to Salt Lake City. SLC airport is very small and obviously just a regional airport. Two best options for getting to downtown are a UTA bus for $2.50 or a free shuttle provided by the Mormon church. The Mormon shuttle will take anyone of any religion to downtown and collect them later in the day and take them back to the airport free of charge. The only catch is you have to do a tour of the Temple Square complex which takes about 40 minutes and involves being guided by two young female missionaries. This tour is excellent but will involve your own religious beliefs being inquired about which I didn't mind but others may want to consider this. Airport itself is only 15 minutes from downtown unlike in most cities where it is some distance away. Airport had good stores albeit rather small. TSA staff were genuinely charming and helpful. Quite long lines for Southwest airlines check in and you MUST have your confirmation number for your flight or you can't check in.

The airport has gotten more restaurants inside of security. Weather delays can be bad during or after a major storm but general not as bad as say Denver International. My only real complaint is that the airport is a major hub for Delta Air Lines not one of my favorites. Delta crams a lot of gates together and at times not enough seats for people waiting.

2009-08-03,3,10,Salt Lake City Airport customer review,Elmore Poulet,Despite often being painfully crowded SLC is moderately convenient for people making connections especially on Delta. Unlike that other major Rocky Mountain hub Denver SLC seems to have many fewer weather delays. About once an hour when all the flights are in the whole airport is slammed but in between it isn't too bad. Each gate's waiting area has only about thirty seats for flights taking hundreds of passengers so crowding is unavoidable. The concourse bathrooms are way too small with too few toilets and not enough room to maneuver roller bags in and out. On the other hand there are plenty of shops and amenities inside security. Concourse E where commuter flights arrive and depart is massively confusing with a long row of gates jammed together just across a walkway from where thousands of passengers try to figure out where they need to go. It's an amazingly bad layout. Delta's SLC Crown Room is showing its age with worn furniture and tattered carpet but the free drinks and complementary T-Mobile wifi are welcome. The Crown Room can also be very crowded at certain times. Outside security the ticket area is too small for the number of passengers and there are often long winding lines to check in. The line outside the Terminal Two security entrance often extends all the way across the bridge to the parking garage then doubles back all the way to the security gate. SLC hint: If the Terminal Two security line is too long try going through security at the adjacent International Terminal. It is often wide open though the last time I was at SLC that checkpoint was closed. I guess the powers-that-be want us to wait in a long line! Car rental is very convenient being in the parking garage just across the street from the terminals and downtown Salt Lake City is very close. Overall SLC is a decent airport without enough facilities for the number of passengers traveling through pretty much like most American airports.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
