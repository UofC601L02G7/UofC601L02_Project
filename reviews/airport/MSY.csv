2024-08-10,10,10,"""I am grateful for being helped""",D Justin,"Not Verified |  My experience with United Airlines at New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport was ramping up towards a masterclass of poor professional service and lack of customer empathy. When a delay came up for my initial flight, I spoke to a remote agent who ultimately said, ""tough luck"" and didn't provide any options. There was no empathy and no discussion of any options to make it home safely. You can imagine I was scared and anxious when my flight to return home was nowhere in sight. Luckily, at United's desk, the representative Anna, who also worked at United, was present. She is the epitome of the perfect professional. She used critical listening to understand my concern and problem-solved on the spot. She gave me an option to return home safely. This wasn't a testament to United training, because it seems like the rep prior routinely told me ""tough luck,"" but it showed how much of a true professional AND good person Anna is. I am grateful for being helped by Anna at New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport, who works at United Airlines. If any problem arises, and she is present, best believe she will give you the most ultimate and efficient service.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

I can confidently say that in terms of international airports this place is probably the worst. There is nothing whatsoever to recommend it. The location is bad. It's been under construction for more than a decade, resulting in the removal of the limited seating and amenities they formerly had in the outer areas where you wait and pick people up. Staff are uniformly rude, uninformed and/or just plain incompetent. It's badly organized and unattractive. There's very little to nothing in the way of assistance for things like ground transport, rental cars and the like. And they don't have that many flights.

But special disdain goes to the rental car location (30 minutes away!) and that the shuttles drop you off at baggage claim for departure. Then there is a long brisk walk and 2 escalators to get to check in where there is a line all the way to the door. We slipped outside and did curbside check in. (The only nice person in the airport was at the curbside check in for Southwest). TSA is very nasty here too, and not empathetic at all. There seems to be tons of wasted space and open areas and very little space that is actually useful. The MSY airport had been remodelled after Hurricane Katrina and it was quite nice back them. Why ruin it for this poorly thought out billion dollar fiasco? It has a very generic look. There is barely any seating except at the terminal. The restaurants and shops are like mall kiosks. For a brand new airport there are few modern conveniences. I feel huge sympathy for anyone elderly or with a disability, this airport is not for you!

This is not the first time NOLA TSA has made us feel this way but I can say with certainty it will be the last, we will never fly from this airport again. They were rude (as usual), cold, uncaring and borderline verbally abusive. You feel like you are in a foreign country with laws you may not understand that could cause you to be arrested. My daughter had fresh torn ligaments and had an orthopedic boot in place. She was barely able to walk on it but managed so we didn’t have the extra burden of crutches. When we approached the first TSA “Agent”, and I use that term loosely, he was so inhuman, unkind and snapped at me about where to place my phone to have my boarding pass scanned. The TSA agent repeating the same unclear instructions again does not explain to me how to do something. Then we had to prepare to be x-rayed, we placed our items in the bins (do that right or you will get yelled at- speaking from previous experience), my daughter was told to take off her shoe but she could leave the boot. She did as told. Entering x-ray, the other very young, poorly trained, rude TSA agent instructed her to remove the ortho boot. I explained she can not do that, she can not stand without the boot. She made her do it anyway, they sent it thought the conveyer x-ray. She stood there approx 3 min, alone, with no support (they would not allow me in to assist her and they would rather die than show some compassion and offer a chair or a helping hand) her right leg was trembling, her affected ankle was in pain from removing the orthopedic boot, I was left to feel helpless. Finally wen the boot scan was complete, I was able to assist with putting it back on. It was extremely painful. In my profession, we are required to go through sensitivity training to make sure our customers always feels safe and to understand how to treat people with respect and kindness. NOLA TSA needs sensitivity training and they to be held accountable for their terrible treatment to passengers! They act as though they are the highest authority in the land and they are untouchable. Totally ridiculous. We rarely travel and to have them start my vacation like that was just unnecessary.

We waited 1 hour and 20 mins in line just to get through airport security.

The worst part was we still had to place our items on the scanner and be scanned through as well. By the time we finished it was 12 mins before the plane was scheduled to leave (3 mins after boarding was over). We ran and made it at 5.50 am for our 6.00 am flight. The gate was closed. Although the plane was there they were not allowing anyone else to board the plane. We missed our flight. And could not get another flight for the rest of the day.

Absolutely a mess and people were so frustrated that no one could move that it became dangerous. The ticketing area was fine but the TSA set up was a giant fail as well. The agents could check people faster than the lines could clear through the scanners so the agents sat idle much of the time and the entire line just was in a dead lock. Once inside I noticed there were only a few restrooms (2 per terminal), all with very long lines (on a Tuesday mid-morning). Gate seating areas were ridiculously undersized for number of passengers on a plane. There was seating for about 50 with the gates directly next to us both filled with their own passengers so people just sat on the floor in the walkways. Not safe! If they intended for overflow to go into next gate they have to plan for that in staggering schedules. Overall I really don't understand why they built this. It is undersized for current needs with no room for growth in the industry. The trend is more people traveling and they seem to be expecting the opposite. Pretty much frustrated with poor scaling the entire morning. We are told to get there with much time to spare (by TSA) but there is no where to go. I will avoid this airport whenever possible.

Think Orlando, Chicago and Miami airport landscaping and signage - all beautifully designed and maintained- not New Orleans - no design talent anywhere outside of the terminal - a waste of a billion dollars! The biggest problem with this 10 week old terminal is that it is filthy - I have been through the airport 4 times since it opened in November and I can attest that the floors have not ben cleaned once since opening. The same stains and dirt piles are on the floors. They have been swept clean by the lazy airport staff, but never washed clean. What a shame after the efforts put into the design and great layout. Atlanta and Detroit airports are all run by similar politically connected vendors- but they are spotlessly clean and beautiful. The New Orleans folks just don’t care about being clean - what a shame.

Toilets were disgraceful, loose fixings, unpleasant smells, inadequate drying facilities. Food outlets were shameful, unreasonably expensive, restricted choices, staff had a totally 'couldn't care less' attitude.

Departure, waiting in line, is the usual waste of life. The thing that turns me sideways is the baggage handling on arrivals, it is almost as if they do it on purpose, seems the handlers get together and discuss just how they can annoy the passengers. I traveled with three other couples on a trip here and there. This trip back from the national parks in Utah was the worst yet when it came to getting our baggage. Walked off the plane at 9.52 pm and 48 minutes later the planes luggage started in on the wrong belt, it came in on a different one that was labeled for the flight. 48 minutes to get luggage from the plane to the belt. The flight took 160 minutes to move one thousand five hundred and ten miles, it took the baggage handlers 48 minutes to move luggage just hundreds of feet. I do not understand what can be the problem, other than incompetence and lack of concern by the airport/airlines. Oh! If you do not pay attention to what the bottom of you luggage looks like, I would recommend that you learn what it looks like from the bottom, because each and every time your luggage comes down the moving belt it will be upside down. Do you take time to consider how you pack your bag, you know, the stuff you don't mind getting mashed you put on the bottom, well your bag will travel upside down anyway so it doesn't matter how you pack it. The baggage handlers suck at what they do. I hold the airport and the airline responsible. Southwest needs to straighten up. In this review, I have given the individual review categories all one star, having to wait on your luggage for way to long of a period takes away from the experience as a whole.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The security areas are not large enough to process peak-time crowds leading to potentially lengthy waits.
