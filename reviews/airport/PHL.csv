The scanner was obviously malfunctioning. How do I know? Well, I was clean but it kept saying I wasn't.  Then, walking on the tarmac to the plane, a baggage handler insisted that I had to ""valet"" my carry-on bag. Once inside, seeing the mostly empty luggage bays, I complained to the flight attendant. She went and brought the bag to me with apologies Arrival was okay, but the I had to follow a ""bread crumb"" trail of corridor, stairs and turns -- all with inadequate signage. Eventually I arrived at two luggage bays and was (at first) relieved to see my flight posted as ""unloading."" But it turned out that we did not get our luggage in hand for 1hr 50mins. No information from the uncommunicative employee in the Baggage Office. She said they were trying to find the agent to ""see if he has any more bags."" (I'm being generous here).

I counted three desks open for hundreds of arriving passengers, it took around an hour to get to the front where I was greeted by a surly immigration officer. No smile, no ""hello"", just barking demands. Once I was through that I needed to change terminal to get my connection to Knoxville, which led to another problem, a distinct lack of signs. Eventually I found the shuttle bus and proceeded to security where a female employee was screaming, actually screaming at passengers. I overheard another employee ask her to dial it down but she ignored him and continued the screaming. Brilliant. Eventually made it to my gate only to find there was a distinct lack of seating, with people standing here there and everywhere. On my return trip I was heading to LHR on an AA 787, and was shocked at how few seats there were at the gate.

They have passengers running from one belt to another, like musical belts early in the morning or late in the evening, often losing passengers baggage because of connecting flights with the very lethargic excuse, well its not here. As someone who has never had missing baggage prior to my experience in Philadelphia, I was disappointed. There are one or two young members who were exceptional in the baggage area, one young man and a young lady working for Air Lingus, really adept at their work inspite of their young age.

It is such a filthy and in some cases unhygienic (bathrooms at baggage claim) experience. It’s embarrassing to know international travelers arrive and this is the first impression they will have. Only to then have their experience topped by airline, TSA, airport staff who scream at passengers while relaying messages. American Airlines desk agents really are something else in Philly. If you’ve never been aggressively screamed at, at 6am for no reason other than to inform you of bag check procedure while waiting in line, come to PHL. The family in front of me asked if this was a normal occurrence. Another passenger assure them it was indeed. The contrast to European or South American airports is jarring. I fly for work once a week and still am in constant disbelief of how little management seems to care about any of it. Employees unwilling to answer question while taking breaks lounging all over the terminal, on their phones blaring TikToks, trash strewn in random corners, displaced people often with mental health challenges living out of baggage claim (often times yelling at arriving passages as I experienced last night). I could go on. Lower every expectation to zero and you will still be disappointed by your experience at PHL.

Having just returned from travel in the UK with great airport experiences I was embarrassed by nearly every aspect of this facility and the staff. It was shocking. Upon arrival we were yelled at and glared at and mistreated by agents and staff. The airport was absolutely filthy and in disrepair. The bathroom in the international arrivals area reeked and had a thick ring of grime around the entire perimeter and on every surface. There was no toilet roll in two of the stalls and a large puddle of urine on the floor of another. The faucets were broken, soap dispensers empty, and bins overflowing. It was disgusting. There were few people willing or able to answer questions or give directions but plenty of employees standing around chatting. The TSA agents were horrible beyond belief. As I was repacking my things following the scans, one agent took my laptop computer. I said where’s my laptop and he said he thought I’d left it and had given it to an officer. I asked where and he pointed in a general direction and walked away. When I inquired with someone else, he snickered and took it back to a different line than the one I’d gone through and rescanned it so I was stuck behind a large group of other people picking up their things. He thought this was hilarious as did the rest of the crew. Meanwhile, my duty free purchases were routed down yet another line for a deeper check. When I found where my bag was, I watched as the employee pulled everything out of it, wiped it with a test strip, and then handed the strip to someone else to scan. Finally, without saying anything to me, the employee shoved my purchases in my general direction and just walked away, leaving all of my things just strewn about the table. It was absolutely chaotic and haphazard. Someone asked if there might be hidden cameras around because we would clearly, obviously be told that this was a joke and we were being set up for a comedy show. I wish! There were three people who were lovely. A security officer in arrivals, the person who took my bag for the next leg of my trip, and the American Airlines gate attendant for my connecting flight.

It’s unacceptable that the toilets are falling apart, that there’s trash everywhere - inside and out of the airport - and it smells like urine”. As of September 20th the area near the C parking elevator still smells like urine. I guess these reviews are not read or believed. The rugs in baggage claim and leading up to the gates are dirty and smell. The parking garage elevators are filthy and always have trash in them. The bathrooms are filthy. The bathroom floors are disgusting. Pushing around dirty water with a mop does not clean the floor. The parking booths are always broken. Parking is way over priced. For many travelers to Philadelphia, the airport is their first impression. A disgrace. How can O’Hare and smaller airports do it so well?

2023-09-13,1,10,"""it is so confusing""",Jim Martin,"✅ Trip Verified |  You should offer a workshop for first time flyers at international airport because it is so confusing. For example, when approaching the airport, I had to circle around 3 times until I was able to find the correct exit or lane for parking my car for a long term stay. There was an airport worker man standing at the entrance area and he offered little assistance to me as I was struggling to understand what to do. I asked him a few times what I needed to do and he said, ""push the red button"" but had zero people skills and made me feel unwelcome. I then tried to figure out the elevator, which didn't seem to be working. I then had to carry all my luggage down 4 flights of stairs. I was flying American Airlines, so my goal was to find the security check in to have all my stuff checked out. I somehow ended up in the wrong area. The airport man behind the counter mumbled something to me about where to go but I honestly had no idea what to do with his directions. I ended up in the baggage claim area for arriving flights, instead of where I needed to be. At this point, I was getting stressed and feeling stupid. I went back to the same airport man and asked him again to direct me. He mumbled the same directions to me and I was off again not knowing where to go or which automatic staircase to go up or go down. I then asked someone, another flyer where I could go for American Airlines departing flights for a check in process. Finally, I felt like I was in the right area. And then the lady airport worker then tells me that I have to go up the staircase to another area for security checking of my bags. I took a break from my confusion and just stood by a table. I felt like I was being treated like a beef cow in line to be slaughtered. It was as of all the airport workers could care less about the travelers and they were all just cattle flowing through the hallways. It was a horrible feeling. And to improve the navigation of passengers, I think Philadelphia International Airport should offer an online video for people who will fly for the first time out of their airport. It would help all of us navigate it better.

To add to this, rude bar staff at Chilies and Pete’s in C gate terminal that would kicked my party from their seating after having purchased food from the restaurant, but not their section of the restaurant, and then again to a man next to us.

There were people sleeping in the hallways on the long and confusing walk, with confusing signage, from the parking area. Staff are friendly for the most part.

I can't say Philadelphia airport is the worst airport I've ever been to as it's clean, has a lot of places to get food and shop, there are a few places to charge your phone, and most of the staff I have encountered are friendly. My only problems with this airport are that flights never depart on time because boarding almost always starts when the flight was supposed to originally take off, it's impossible to get a wifi connection and some of the staff can be quite careless. I was recently in a position where I had a connecting flight and was put on standby and left to sit around the gate even after the plane had taken off just to be informed I would not be put on the flight, and if I managed to get on the next one I would be stranded in Arizona overnight for possibly 3 whole days. I had only ever agreed to originally being on standby as the person who booked my ticket had assured me I'd be on the plane, so I can understand what the other reviewers are talking about when they comment on confusion among staff. I had to talk to 3 people before having to cancel my flight and pay for a new ticket, but the situation left me stuck in Philadelphia, as I had come from New Jersey. I wish Philadelphia airport had more options when it comes to getting from there to Jersey and vice versa as Philadelphia airport is the only airport near Jersey besides New York (Atlantic City doesn't count).

After another 30+ minute wait, which ended with someone taking our customs slip and nothing else, we advanced to security where we had to witness the same ridiculous line rearranging, with equally frustrating results. Another 30+ minute wait and we were pretty strung out. Fast-forward to our boarding process, where the gate agent forced me to check my bag in spite of the fact that it fit the guidelines perfectly. There was seemingly no logical reasoning behind why she chose my bag, which had glass in it. After boarding our flight, I had the pleasure of watching the gentlemen loading our bags toss mine onto the conveyor belt. If I wanted the glass tossed, I'd have checked it in the first place.

We were too early to do the bag drop and had to wait in an uncomfortable hall with limited seating and no facilities until the check in opened. No staff were there to help us find the concession in the arrival hall as I have experienced in other airports and any staff we asked were very unhelpful. Furthermore, there was not even signage for restrooms or elevators, which surely should be standard in any public building. The travel conditions were such that it was advisable to arrive in good time, but the airport made no provision to make this wait comfortable. Also, the departure boards only listed US and Canadian flights, so it was impossible to find out anything about the status of the flight until the check in opened. Again, this is the first time I have ever been at an airport where information was not provided about all of its departures. Once we passed through security, the overall standard was much hire, but first impressions are difficult to forget, especially whe experienced for a number of hours.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-01-03,10,10,"""has shown vast improvement""",Marianne Bonner,"Philadelphia International is an airport which has shown vast improvement over the past several years. Terminals are clean and bright. It's layout has become much more user friendly and both the quality and number of amenities offered has been greatly enhanced. Public transportation (SEPTA's Airport Line of its regional rail system) provides quick and easy access to Center City Philadelphia and Amtrak. It is also located near I-95, I-76 and 474 (the Blue Route). For international travel, customs is a breeze. My biggest complaint is with the airline industry which charges hundreds of dollars more for the convenience of flying out of Philadelphia. They are practically forcing leisure travelers on a budget to hike north to Newark and JFK. Given that those airports are in no danger of going out of business, I fail to understand why Philadelphia travelers are treated so shabbily.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

Clark,"If you are returning to the U.S. on an International flight that requires you to get your connecting flight home through Philadelphia, make sure you have about a 3 hour layover. Airport is a nightmare! I have flown internationally several times and have never experienced upon re-entering the U.S, an airport that is as ill equipped in handling this process. From beginning to end, it took 2.5 hours. You are required to be processed through multiple stages where you stand in one horrific line after another. The airport staff you encounter through the entire process are completely apathetic about their jobs and move at a snails pace. Luckily my flight was delayed but even then I barely made it. I literally had to run full speed through the airport to catch my connecting flight and the plane door closed right behind me. Avoid this airport if at all possible when needing to connect from an International flight - it is a nightmare.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

For years, literally, years, they have been working on that terminal, seemingly without end. It is finally done and it is a Universe away from where they started. It is bright and sunny, ample seating and electrical outlets and has lots of food options at the new Food Court. Gone is the "" Prison Riot just ended"" look that plagued the place for years and made me cry every time I had to connect through PHL. There is still construction ongoing and you have to slough a mile to get your luggage, all the while dodging sketchy men approaching you to see if you want a taxi. They are older men in suits, clearly not licensed Taxi company employees. The Airport Authority need to keep these shady characters out of the baggage claim/ground transport.

2015-08-11,1,10,Philadelphia Airport customer review,Ben Kelly,"I'm a frequent traveller and I know that things happen, but never before have I had to go through so much to simply catch a connecting flight. Dozens and dozens of passengers ended up missing their connections. My luggage was just tossed off the carousel and left on the floor out in the open. Luggage that I had to go find after spending 2 hours waiting to declare any goods. Afterwards checking in with my airline and having my flight rescheduled, I checked my baggage and then waited in another line for 40 minutes. This line was to screen all carry on luggage and passengers again. Also, everybody's drinks (that came off the U.S. Airways flight) had to be discarded. My sealed duty free bag was cut open, the seal on the package inside opened, and the sealed bottle was removed then swabbed. Again, this was to be a quick layover before catching my connecting flight. Another highlight was the airport employee yelling to the other airport employee in the middle of the souvenir shop about bad she had to go to the bathroom. Classy. I'd recommend that this airport be avoided whenever possible.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

From unusual pattern holding efforts while arriving for a connection, extraordinary taxi and delay efforts, delays in opening the cabin door to a need to travel half way to New York through the concourse and a bus trip to find my gate. To top it off, a 30 minute delay on the runway waiting to take off due to heavy volume. Thank goodness the weather was good. All through the concourse I could see monitors with pretty people promoting the airport with claims of greatness. Now, if they could only translate their self promotion into actionable change then the experience would improve.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-08-01,1,10,Philadelphia Airport customer review,Joe Bledsoe,"We arrived at Philadelphia Airport from Paris, France. As we approached customs, there was one person yelling for Americans to line up on the left and non Americans on the right. No signs were posted. It then took us almost two hours to stand in long lines to reach three different stages for re-entry into the U.S. After being in line for 45 minutes, we showed our passports to a machine that printed out our pictures and answers to the ""declarations"" form we had completed with paper/pen on our flight. Then we had to show our passports and declarations form to a live person after lining up for another 20-30 minutes. We were then released to the baggage area and then had to stand in another 10-15 minute line to show our form again before getting out to the street or other terminals. The airport was understaffed and the staff were uniformly rude or simply disinterested. As we tried to make our connecting flight to Dayton, OH, we were directed to get the shuttle bus to terminal F. The staff member pointed us down the hallway. We soon discovered he had pointed the wrong way and we had to return and go another direction to get to the street. At terminal F, the TSA folks who checked our liquids and carry ons, etc. could not have been ruder or more indifferent. Fortunately our connecting flight was 45 minutes late. We stood in lines for about 2 hrs, 15 minutes to reenter the US and make a connecting flight.

We arrived from St. Petersburg, Russia via Paris. The Moscow and St. Petersburg airports and Customs processes were understandable and efficient, though we don't understand Russian. Paris was also easy. Then we arrive back to the USA and Philadelphia Airport, where despite being literate in English, we can't figure out what to do and the personnel seem more interested in barking at us than helping. The long snaking queues of people being treated like cattle in depressing. I couldn't understand why we had redundant security checks, and talked to the TSA fellow. He said he'd been trying to get it changed for 12 years, and that Philly is the only airport where when you arrive in the international terminal, it is then treated as if you have left the airport and re-entered when you go to the domestic terminal, so they need to repeat the security process. Our bags got lost and it took over two hours  for security and Customs. Disgusting women's rest rooms with long lines.
