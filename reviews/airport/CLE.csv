2024-07-21,5,10,"""TSA rude, obnoxious, and, slow",A Wil,"Not Verified |  | I fly a decent amount for work so I have gone to the TSA in a lot of airports in the USA yet, somehow Cleveland TSA seems to go out of their way to be rude, obnoxious, and, slow. This last time they confused a portable monitor for a tablet and got annoyed at me for their ignorance, and said I had four laptops. I had just one laptop for work and a small tablet. I have been the TSA at BNA, ATL, GSP, ORD, SFO, ONT, MKE, and Monteray (MEX) with the same gear this year without a problem. Yet Cleveland TSA has got to be obnoxious about it. The Airline ground staff at Cleveland has always been amazing, especially with Delta, and United, friendly helpful, and present, in my opinion, they make up for a lot of the facility's shortcomings.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2024-03-04,1,10,"""problem is poor staffing and planning""",Barry DiJulius,"Not Verified |  Flew back in December from Hopkins and spent 90 minutes in line for security. Today, 3/3/24, I checked my bags and saw that the line for security was the entire length of the airport! While we were waiting in line, we were offered “CLEAR” for a faster way through security. We never would have made our 10:50am flight, despite arriving at 8am. So, we spent the large sum of money on “CLEAR” to ensure our vacation was not ruined. The people in security used the excuse that traffic was high for spring break. I didn’t see any groups of young people that looked like they were going to a beach. Spring break is still a week or two away! The problem is poor staffing and planning. I use to fly twice a week through Hopkins for 12 years and never experienced the ridiculousness that I experienced in December and again today. This is the age of “It is no one’s fault and no one takes ownership.” Remember when Cleveland was the best location in the nation?

Every time I go through security at Cleveland is unnecessary slow and some issue with TSA. They are the rudest agents that look for problems and overreact to everything. I fly LAX and ATL frequently with no issues ever. This trip out of Cleveland they wanted to do a full pat down because a coin sized yellow dot came up in my jeans pocket area when I went through the x-ray machine. I asked to check my pockets and go back through and they refused, used intimidation tactics of getting in my face to make me submit to a pat down. I refused and was kicked out. Checked my pocket and a penny had snuck up in crease. You would think professional TSA agents would be able to recognize a coin when they see it and not subject a traveler to be felt up. Other airports wouldn’t have done that. They also wouldn’t allow me to touch my cleared luggage or purse until I submitted to pat down.

I would much prefer to use Canton/Akron but end up using CLE when the deal is just too good to pass up. I flew out this past Saturday and watched a bunch of employees walk around with little idea of how to get a crowd through security while employing some type of social distancing. One woman walked around simply shouting ""6 feet"" and an employee standing in the CLEAR aisle actually argued with a customer about why CLE just wasn't prepared for the crowd that morning. I do not pay for pre-check, but the gentleman in front of me did, and he was irate that there wasn't even a pre-flight aisle open and he was stuck in the same inefficient line with the rest of us.

In order to get to ticketing or from baggage carousels, you have to go down one escalator, with your bags in tow, then drag them to the next escalator to go up.

He looked around the the scanner and underneath it as well, and told us we would have to get new boarding passes printed at out departure gate.

2014-06-20,3,10,Cleveland Airport customer review,M Dubuc,The security checkpoint setup in the main terminal is terrible. Congested too few lanes waits that require you to stand on steps. I flew through CLE two years ago and I thought then I hit the occasional bad day. Flew through yesterday was worse though not really that busy. What was really disappointing is that nothing has been done in two years to improve the situation. It's way past the time knowing these security stations are going to be a permanent requirement so Airport mgt needs to step up and get some over due renovations done. In addition the restrooms in concourse A are undersized narrow halls to get into then way too small with too few facilities. The rest rooms and security the Airport can do something about. The last comment has to do with the location of the car rental facility. Common sense would have had the facility as close to the airport as possible for customer convenience along the main road but no site selection put the at the end of a dead end street the bus passing empty acreage which would have been much more convenient.,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
