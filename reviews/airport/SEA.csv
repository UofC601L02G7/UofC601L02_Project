2024-09-19,1,10,"""What a disappointment""",T Garrison,"Not Verified |  First time at this airport. What a disappointment after such a great cruise vacation. Long line backed into traffic just to get to departure gates. When we tried to check our bags at the kiosk, it wouldn't work so, we waited in line 15 minutes to get assistance only to be told that Seattle doesn't allow bags to be checked more than 4 hrs before flight. What the heck!! So now we're stuck standing with 4 pcs of luggage because AA pushed our flight back by 2 hrs. No place to sit! The 3 or 4 small eateries were quickly taken up with people dragging lg suitcases who refused to give up their seat once they finished eating. The area near luggage check quickly got overcrowded with people pulling many large suitcases. To have this ""4-hr"" policy & no general seating (handicap only), makes no sense. Once we finally checked the bags & went to TSA, another nightmare. An hour + at least in line. One of the employees directing people said the reason for the madness was 2 cruise ships just disembarked with 10,000 ppl. Miami doesn't have an issue. Workers are rude & not enough body scanners. I and my carry-on went through the metal detector only to be told that because my knees set it off, I should now go to the line 4 lanes over with a full body scanner. Crazy!! Put scanners at all the TSA lanes! Once we got to our gate (escalator was broken), it was dirty, torn seats and smelled. Only 1 working bathroom in that concourse & it was nasty with no soap in any of the dispensers (women's). The air at the terminal was stagnant & warm. Due to the construction, I don't think there was any ventilation. The icing on the cake is when I overheard an annoyed pilot speaking with a flight attendant saying how much he hates flying into this airport.

(After spending about 20 minutes trying to even find where to go). There was no signage and the path to get there is a construction zone right now; we had to weave around various obstacles. We got on the 4th shuttle after about 30 minutes of waiting. Then we had to wait 45 min in line to actually get the car that I had already paid for and had already pre-checked in for (well that’s Budget’s fault, not SeaTac’s). Between these issues and taxiing on the runway, I didn’t leave the airport until 3 hours after touching down. I also had a bad experience last year when flying out of SeaTac, I almost missed my flight despite arriving 90 minutes early because of their “spot saver” program. People are allowed to just cut in line for the security check.

The ""train"" system is a farce. Takes so long to get between terminals. I suppose if you use the airport a lot you ""know"" the in's and out's of how it operates. If you are a first timer I am afraid it is an airport to lay down and avoid if you can. Took us 1.5 hours from time we arrived at the airport to get to the gate in the ""S"" terminal. TSA was slow, transiting inside the airport was slow. Then we missed the flight by 2 mins. That's another issue with Frontier! If you do have to use this airport I suggest you add at least 1.5 hours to what you normally expect at other airports. When we arrived it was no better. Took so long to get from the arrival gate to the off airport rental car location. The place is a mess and who ever designed it needs a head read. It's just nasty. Seems whoever owns this place is more focused on building a sprawling ediface than serving the people that use it. So sad in a first world country to have to endure a place like this.

Airport under construction so had to disembark to a shuttle, that broke down, then to a tram just to get to the terminal. For some needing a wheelchair, good luck; uncomfortable metal carts where the porters drop you off and left you there with no way to get around afterwards (bathroom, food, water) it took agents 30 to 45 minutes to get a wheelchair for assistance.

On my departure I arrived two hours before a domestic flight and missed my flight. The TSA lines were absolutely awful. There is no direction, no way to find the end of the incredibly long lines. You can pay for special lines (Clear and Pre-check) which seem to be better staffed but who knows if that would have helped. I was booked on a later flight so I stored my bags, very hard to find, another long line. The air-train into Seattle was great! Only $3 and easy to navigate. Once back for my later flight I had to wait forever to retrieve my bags and go back through security. It took almost an hour with a spot saver at a time the airport was not crowded. The closest bathrooms were closed, no bottle filler close by, just not a good experience at all. My plane was then delayed over an hour waiting for flight crew while we sat on the tarmac.

2024-06-12,1,10,“customer satisfaction was not a priority”,J.S Haytread,"Not Verified | I recently had the misfortune of passing through Sea/Tac Airport, and I must say, it was an experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. From the moment I stepped foot inside, I was greeted with an atmosphere of disdain and hostility that permeated every corner of the terminal. The staff, if you can even call them that, were the epitome of rudeness. It was as if they had undergone special training in how to make passengers feel unwelcome and inconvenienced. Any attempt at seeking assistance was met with eye rolls, sighs of exasperation, and curt, dismissive responses. It's as if they viewed travelers not as valued customers, but as nuisances disrupting their day. The lack of basic courtesy was astonishing. It's one thing to encounter a grumpy employee here or there, but it seemed like a pervasive culture of indifference had infected the entire workforce. It was abundantly clear that customer satisfaction was not a priority for them. To add insult to injury, the facilities were woefully inadequate. Long queues snaked through the terminal, with no discernible logic or organization. Overall, my experience at Sea/Tac Airport left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. It's a shame that such a crucial hub for travel can be so poorly managed and staffed by individuals who seem to take pleasure in making passengers' lives miserable. I would advise anyone considering flying through this airport to think twice and explore alternative options if possible.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2024-05-30,3,10,"""escorted me back to Agricultural Products""",Jane Lotz-Drlik,"Not Verified |   ""Welcome to the United States."" (Message to international visitors and returning residents at Seattle/Tacoma International Airport). A connecting flight in Amsterdam with a 90-minute window turned into a sprint for the gate after a backlog at Passport Control. The employees there worked hard to continue monitoring the flight departures of those waiting. The backlog was, apparently due to current U.S. mandates about rechecking all passports at certain airports, including Schiphol/Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Perhaps some European airports are more experienced in handling security and passport control. They were, after all, screening passengers more closely for nearly a half-century before American airports did more than x-ray bags and ask international passengers to declare duty items purchased overseas. We Americans did not appear very popular in the overseas airport on that day. A kind Croatian friend gave me fruit for the journey. She has never had means to travel or the luxury of wasting food, so can't comprehend the immediate confiscation of food products upon arrival in U.S. She also speaks better English than the male Passport Control official at Window 13, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, whose questions consisted of the following: (missing verbs are his, not my transcribing) ""Why you in Amsterdam? Why you in Vienna? Why you bring fruit?"" I had to repeat myself twice and raise my voice several volumes for his comprehension. He then had me escorted to the empty Agricultural Products area, where the two personnel at X-ray aisle 15 threw the produce away. When I asked if I could eat my two apples and a tangerine in their view, one said: ""This isn't a dining area."" The other said that fruits and vegetables couldn't enter the country. ""Regulations"". I believe she meant unpackaged. And, of course, they were already IN the country. And, of course, the regulations quoted state that these foods must be declared. No displayed regulation states that they must be confiscated without chance of consumption, thereby raising the chances of unpackaged food going unreported and actually moving through the country. When I retrieved some of my belongings, I told the personnel that I would know how to handle any produce in future. Both told me that my ""threat was recorded on security cameras."" Note: I had forgotten to remove the paring knife provided by my Croatian hostess, which was in my carry-on bag. It traveled through all security without incident, including the rechecks in Seattle/Tacoma International Airport. I still have it. My duty-free bag didn't exit with my other luggage. I went back for it. Two security guards' escorted me back to Agricultural Products, one checking the bag (which had already been through Passport Control with the aforementioned official at Window 13), checking receipts, asking to verify the credit card used for purchase, then escorting me out. Apparently security doubles for Agricultural Produce employees? Security guards now assume the duties of Customs officials? No one else seems to be carrying them out. What is that costing the U.S. in Customs duties? Everyone was busy with a tangerine and two apples and a duty-free bag. I sincerely thank all of the flight and gate personnel at Seattle/Tacoma International. The less said about certain Ag Produce and Passport Control personnel, the better.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

These lies could not be believed by even the one saying them. There is no effort to improve conditions. Driving through arrivals/departures there is no order or enforcement and it is like the wild Wild West.

It isn’t. Ask anyone who has ever traveled through any other airport. Hire an outside leadership group to identify the problems, or anyone who works and lives outside of the Portland/Seattle area, get rid of the people who won’t change, and then start to get to normal.

2024-01-26,1,10,“avoid it like the plague” ,Ocha Onazi,"Not Verified | Such a dreadful experience. Long story short: DO NOT TRANSIT THROUGH THIS AIRPORT. Want details? Read on: I often travel in Africa, Europe and the USA, and I have transited through the USA- been through Denver, through JFK, through San Francisco, even Washington DC. In my 7 years of travelling across the US, never in my life have I ever faced an airport with such stupid processes, such laziness, such disorganization in my life! I booked a premium Virgin Atlantic flight to San Jose which had me transiting for the first time through Seattle. Layover time: 70 minutes on the ticket. At Heathrow, the check-in desk informed me I would need to pick up my bags then drop them off again. I thought nothing of it, thinking it would be a transit as usual. Now Virgin Atlantic even landed 25 minutes earlier, giving me 95 minutes to transit. Who created the baggage claim before passport control system? That team or person must be inhumane or just plain dumb. What happens to people who have connecting flights? It makes no sense. Took me 20 minutes to get to and claim my baggage (excellent job on Virgin Atlantic and the ground crew!) another 40 minutes through passport control, and 60 minutes through TSA. They had just one lane for hundreds of people transiting. Then after about 20 minutes someone with an iota of common sense opened another lane. Then the TSA agent opened my sealed Duty Free bag of champagne to test it, saying it flagged up on the system. After testing the glass bottle she then offered I check it in or abandon it because it could not go with me. I told her my flight left 5 minutes ago - she then had a physical malfunction. You could see it in her face. She did not know what to say. Then she had to pat me down, running through their bloody speech as you do. I was clear & vocal about my thoughts, my irritations, and my impressions of Seattle airport to any staff within earshot. That TSA agent was a robot. On the one side I felt for her, on the other I decided to put myself first too. Other passengers near me and even a couple of her colleagues were sympathetic and wondered why it needed checking when it was sealed. I should have gotten her name, but I was in a rush to get the next flight. I was not about to be stuck in this city for another moment more than necessary. My bag left with Virgin Atlantic. I missed my flight by 15 minutes. Got booked for the next flight which would have me landing in San Jose 90 minutes later than planned, and in economy. So now I have to call Virgin Atlantic for a refund of some sort and see if I can get my bottle of champagne refunded too. Now, my mind was rapidly sensitised to the mediocrity around me in that airport. When I got the boarding pass for the next flight, the agent told me to head to the gate. Finding the gate was a maze of a walk and a transit train too. When I got to the gate- I noticed the boarding pass did not have a seat number. Yeah, I had to think fast and speak to the air hostess at the counter; they had to reprint a new boarding pass! The agent did not even tell me about this. Jeez- the staff are so laid back it’s borderline unprofessional and quite frankly incompetent and inconsiderate at the barest minimum. In conclusion, if you must go through Seattle, have a layover of 4 hours at least- otherwise avoid it like the plague. This experience has left a bitter taste in my mouth.

There was no help for anyone trying to make a connecting flight- I would never recommend that you book a connecting flight within 4 hours of arriving, and would suggest leaving it until the following day to be on the safe side. And you would have thought that at Christmas where there is a known spike in the number of people travelling that there would be more booths manned by Immigration Officials- but no that was not the case. And to have to listen to the never-ending message over the tannoy welcoming us to Seattle, was like adding insult to injury. I flew with Icelandair which I would thoroughly recommend, but for the future I’ll be flying Aer Lingus as I can pre-clear in Dublin, as I simply will not put myself through that endurance test again.

What an absolute joke! Security line looked like a stirred up mess, but the board did say 35 mins to go through, so we didn’t really panic at that time. After trailing up, then down, then up and down, then across the bottom of a long rectangle, we thought, one more up and we’ll be at the security desk, were we heck as like - we had another three up and down and then a half line up again (the half because of a big pillar - which explained why the original up and down lines then crossed over the bottom). By this time we were around 30 minutes off our flight and we still had to go through the security checks and scanner (downright bloody lie that the board was still saying 35 mins to security - nearer 3 hours). Staff were not helpful at all except every now and then they’d barge someone to the front of the queue - for no apparent reason, either they had clearance of some sort and should have been in a different queue or their face fitted ! but it was so infuriating to watch. Any mention of missing flights due to the queues was met with selective deafness or a shrug of the shoulders. When we finally got through the scanning I asked a member of staff where our gate was and he flew his hands in the air and said “follow the signs”. Now being very close to close of boarding, even knowing which direction to look would have been helpful. Turns out following the directions was not the quickest way - there was a tram downstairs which would have saved us quite a hike. Never seen so many people running for gates in my life - obviously in the same boat as us. Our family, who live in LA, had TSA clearance and got through in about 10 minutes - I’m sure you can imagine the text messages passing between us. When we fly through Edinburgh/ London/ Manchester etc I see a pretty decent distribution of staff welcoming visitors worldwide as well as nationals with all people treated with respect. Seattle airport seemed to have an emphasis on nationals or TSA approved and very few staff attending to the general boarding line. (Most of the security screens were closed) We made our flight with minutes to spare, no time to pick up some water or a bite to eat on the plane. There were empty seats on out flight which our family found rather odd as the flight was full with a list of stand by passengers - guess those poor guys were still in the magic roundabout they call a security line - which is definitely a roundabout but there no magic in it.

It took us about an hour, and that isn't the most unreasonable amount of time, but there were some really glaringly bad aspects to the design of the place and some of their protocols that will steer me away from every flying through SeaTac again. I will say the luggage retrieval/customs/passport control/baggage redrop section was fast and efficient.  From getting off the plane and to pick up your luggage, the walk is hard to measure. I know that walked 1500 steps, about 1/4 - 1/3 mile (guesstimating based on my known ~2200 steps/mile) and it's difficult to measure the distance on a map, but it was a solid 3/4 of a mile by the time we got through the whole maze to the main terminal. There were no moving sidewalks at all, and the escalator to the top of the bridge (which allows passage of airplanes) was long and slow, as was the one on the other side. I walked down the steps and beat my husband to the bottom. After baggage/passport/customs, if you have a transfer or connecting flight, you have to get TSA'd again, full security screening, even though we hadn't even entered the main terminal yet... we were still effectively behind security. Additionally, the line was long and they only had 1 screening lane open, but did eventually open 2. This fancy new facility is not disability friendly, I'm lucky that I can walk the distances required. It just has a feel of being sparkly and over-engineered.

The end of the line went back to the stairs where you enter the area and then weaved around the different baggage claim/luggage pickup spots. Very confusing and unorganized. The only way you knew where the end of the line was there was a guy with a sign saying END OF THE LINE. Some really rude employees. I asked about passengers with short connections and was told ""We don't do short connections"" It took us 45-1 hr. just to get thru the first winding rope area to finally get to go get in line at the customs/immigration. Then off in a mad rush to get to our gate. First have to go thru security again, another 30 minutes in line. At this point we got to meet the rudest airport security person ever.

Now, the airport received a light dusting of snow that closed it down numerous times over the Christmas holidays. Canceled flights, delays compounding an already busy system, stranded passengers were the norm and it affected flights from all across the nation. But Seatac has it's cute little food delivery robots getting in passengers ways. How much did that total waste cost? Maybe if that money had been spent on a few more pieces of snow removal equipment the airport could have remained functioning. While it is not often that Seattle gets snow, it does happen regularly, even with global warming. Who ever is in charge of the airport is a total buffoon and incompetent and must be a pay back room appointee.

The passengers indeed can actually seem rather hostile, perhaps because they're crammed like sardines in an old, outdated, small, dingy, filthy airport that always seems to be under construction without any tangible progress in modernization. There is no logical connectivity between the terminals, whether you're relying on signage or the inter-terminal tram. I mean, isn't the purpose of a tram to logically piece the airport together? The floors don't look like they've been cleaned since 1987. The restrooms, unkempt sometimes. Delays in arriving to, and departing from, the gate are common, because this airport has had a dramatic spike in flights without any accompanying increase in people-handling and gate capacities. If you have to visit the Pacific Northwest, fly into Portland, OR or Bellingham, WA in the US, or Victoria, BC or Vancouver, BC in Canada (though Canadian immigration and customs aren't exactly any more pleasant than their American counterparts).",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'January 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

If you are not a US citizen, do not, I repeat, do not make a transit at this airport, you will not make it in time. Of the 6 times, I've arrived here internationally, it took an average of 1.5 hours just to clear the immigration checkpoint each time, with a maximum of 3 hours from personal experience. After clearing customs, all other airports that I've been to have your checked luggage up and out on the carousel in 20 minutes max. Here, it's at least an hour's wait so it doesn't even matter if you've cleared the immigration checkpoint quickly. Finally when you exit to ground transport, do not use the bag conveyor belt to deliver your luggage separately before taking the transit train to Seattle exit and ground transportation else you'll have to wait another 10 minutes for your bags to arrive by the conveyor belt after you've arrived by the transit train. This airport is not just understaffed, it suffers from very visible underemployment and operation inefficiencies. For example, the airport management has in their infinite wisdom decided to station not one but two workers at each luggage carousel to arrange bags neatly on the carousel as they arrive by the conveyor belt so that they don't tip over. This task is absolutely pointless - I've still seen bags tip over and being rearranged by other passengers standing beside it. So now you have two persons being paid to just stand by the carousel chit-chatting and occasionally moving a bag or two when they could be doing something more useful like delivering the bags quickly. All in all, too much waiting and a poor experience every single time. Is it too much to ask for an airport to do its job quickly so I don't have to stand for another 3 hours after a 12-hour transpacific flight?

You wait in very long lines with very poor line management, changing the configuration willy nilly at will and people in the back of the line might be first ones through kind of deal. Then because their long lines are so terrible with poor customer service and direction usually your bags are out on baggage claim. Used to have to wait for that for hours but they've fixed that problem by delaying you elsewhere. Then our bag is lost and nobody knows where it is or really helps in any way. There is no convenient counter to offer assistance. Every person working there is like a free agent, not connected to the larger web. Then you wait in another line to get through baggage and when you voluntarily have one item checked out by animal control they rudely handle your stuff.  Then when you finally find someone at a baggage counter and say 'hello' they don't bother looking up from their phone to say hi back and then are just so not helpful that you decide to run screaming out of this whole place and try your luck on the phone later because humans are incompetent.

I am going to complain about an unsafe practice that is directly caused by airport management. The use of buses to take passengers to their planes is something I have seen before and understand. However, filling the buses with passengers like sardines with carry on luggage is a recipe for disaster. I complained to the workers and they kept pushing people in. As I expected, the bus had to come to a hard stop (normally I would not have considered the stop as bad), and everyone wound up bumping into each other and tripping over luggage. No one was hurt but this is an accident waiting to happen. They had four buses queued up and it was unnecessary to unsafely pack this many people just because they think this is a subway car or a street bus. I choose to be on those and subject myself to that when necessary but not at an airport with carry on luggage. The other disappointing feature of the airport is its dinginess. The outside areas where you wait are poorly maintained with debris all over along with dirty walls and sidewalks. Not what I have come to expect from a US airport.

I headed for Passport Control and was told to stop and wait in a corridor to the Passport area. I waited and waited for 90 minutes along with several other people , most of whom complained to the staff on duty after an hour. Announcements came over the intercomms that the passport control area was very full and they were trying their best to clear the backlog. The area where we were queueing was a corridor less than four metres wide , with at least 50 to sixty other people off the same flight. This area was very hot and became unsafe, so much so that we were offered free water whilst we waited. Several other planes arrived and putting it bluntly we were discriminated against. Although we had the necessary ESTA documentation to enter the States we along with many other passengers had to endure watching passengers rush right past us and enter the passport area to be processed whilst we had to wait in line. Many of those waiting missed onward flights thanks to this policy. After 90 minutes (roughly) we were allowed into the processing area. 30 plus finger printing machines were there for us to use. So after a nine hour flight and ninety minutes waiting in a very hot area we were given the task of taking our own finger prints . Now I understand English perfectly and read the instructions perfectly, but would the machine take my prints ? ….NO. I then checked the screen below where my fingers had been, the finger plate was dirty , greasy and covered in what I assumed was sweat. I pointed this out to an attendant. There were just two helpers at the time trying to control this area and barking at the passengers. Two helpers for 30 dirty fingerprinting plates and people from all over the world not understanding the instructions walking around puzzled, bewildered and disenchanted . So wondering what germs or micro biological virus I would pick up from this experience I transferred to a different machine. Eventually I obtained a piece of paper with a large “X” across it. I had failed my first test to get into the USA, now I was being barked at again and being ordered to another queue about two and half hours after my landing in the United States. After three hours I was given the all clear by a United States Customs Officer in a little booth, with his own finger printing machine that eventually, (although just as unclean as the previous one) agreed to read my finger tips ! This was a very bad experience. Despite many complaints by my fellow passengers, many of whom were fellow Brits, we all felt we were discriminated against. The young customs officer who eventually allowed us in to the United States stated “We are getting new machinery soon”. This experience which I can prove beyond doubt will mean I will never travel through Seattle again.

The N and S terminal seating is dirty and broken, with hair, crumbs, and other grime lodged between the seats. Built-in power outlets in the N terminal seating do not work (the seating is Alaska Airlines branded, which reflects poorly on an otherwise decent airline). Some of the S terminal seating is not properly balanced or secured, which creates an awkward see-saw effect when another passenger sits down. Many of the airport's vintage Simplex clocks (obviously from the 1970s) are broken, which is unacceptable for any transportation facility. The process of using a train to access the satellite terminals from the main terminal and luggage claim is time consuming, arcane, poorly explained, and functionally obsolete. Elevators in the main terminal are slow (the cheaper hydraulic type) and difficult to find. In the domestic baggage claim, passengers are accosted by off-duty Port employees who sit behind a table eating fast-food and talking loudly amongst themselves (something so bizarre and inappropriate, I thought I was hallucinating).

2017-02-14,1,10,"""has outgrown itself""",R Matthews,"✅ Verified Review | SeaTac is an embarrassment to Seattle with a monopoly. Even with PreCheck security is slow and often horribly slow for those without PreCheck. TSA sets up the security areas in very confusing and inefficient ways. Their priority seems to be how to squeeze in the longest possible lines of people rather than moving people through efficiently. SeaTac has outgrown itself. The region really needs another airport. There are often delays for take off. If you're lucky you back away from the gate on time but then either just sit somewhere on the tarmac or crawl along in a long line of planes breathing jet fumes. I've also landed many times and then had to sit waiting for a free gate. If you take anything but the light rail you're often stuck in horrible traffic congestion just getting to the airport. And it doesn't matter if you take the bus, use off-site parking, take Uber, a cab, etc. Everyone is stuck in the same mess. Around holiday peak travel times it can take 30+ minutes to travel the last mile or less to the airport. If you take the light rail to avoid the horrific traffic congestion, it's a very long, often cold or hot and sweaty walk. Most of the walk is outdoors which in a city with Seattle's weather makes no sense. And, regardless, it's a really long walk you have to account for when deciding when to arrive (or for those who can't walk long distances). During busy times the passenger arrival and drop-off areas are an absolute mess. People are parked 2 or 3 lanes deep with the cars on the inside trapped with no way out. It's likely partly so bad because the cell phone lot is often full as well. SeaTac simply doesn't have enough land to support the volume. I avoid flying with checked luggage as it's often a 30 to 45 minute wait for your bag. Sometimes it's been an hour. You ask at the baggage desk what's going on and they always say something like ""we had a shift change"" or they make some other excuse. Sometimes perhaps a third of the bags will hit the carousel then nothing for the next 15 minutes with everyone standing around complaining. You would think in a tech-heavy city like Seattle, SeaTac would offer great free WiFi right? Wrong. It's cumbersome to get access as the system first tries to sell you access. And once you do jump through all the hoops to get free access it's only good for 30 minutes and often horribly slow. There are also areas with no WiFi coverage. It's embarrassing for a tech city. SeaTac brags their shopping offers the same prices you would pay anywhere else, but that's because most of the food and shopping options are not available anywhere but in airports. So a small bottle of water is still $2.75. Prices are often not posted for beverages at restaurants or some of the shops/stands. That pint of local beer? $9.00 when it would be $5.00 or less elsewhere. The international arrivals and customs is horrible with long lines, no windows, etc. There's trash on the floor, the tables in the food court are usually gross, the restrooms have wet floors you don't want to set your bags on, and if you look along the walls and in the nooks and crannies there looks to be a months-old buildup of dirt.

My annual travel is in excess of 100K so I am well versed in airport logistics, however, Seattle airport ranks as one of the worst in the country in my opinion. Security personnel are not only inefficient and understaffed but also rude and inconsiderate. The security lines are inexcusably long resulting in frustrated passengers and missed flights despite being at the airport in ample time. Those who travel frequently are aware of the perils of last minute gate changes and as such, check the monitors frequently. However, when the port of Seattle cannot even update airport monitors to reflect the correct gate, it can make the most seasoned travelers enraged. The carpets look like they are rarely vacuumed, much less spot cleaned and many of the electrical outlets for powering devices do not even work. My advice: chose another airport if you can. Seattle should be able to do better than this.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The TSA at Seatac is by far the worst. It is worse than going through customs at Newark. They are slow and rude and not helpful. I arrived for an 11.05 flight at 9.50, thinking without checking a bag and checking in online that would be suffient. It was not. I missed my flight by 2 mins. It took me 55 mins to get through security and that included me cutting in line. The agents provided no assistance. They made me ask each person ahead of me permission to cut (everyone said of course and I could sense their disdain for the agents rudness). I've been in much longer lines that have moved twice as fast. Give yourself 2 hrs at this airport, even without checked bags. Also, the TSA pre line was very crowded and slow as well. Side note: the rental car facility bus system is nice and new and clean but not more efficient than what it was before. Expect long lines for the bus. Taking a cab to the facility is cheap and is probably faster.

There were no reader boards to advise us on where we needed to go to catch our connecting flight (1 hour 55 minutes after landing from ANC). There were no personnel to ask, so we got on the train to the main terminal, hoping to find out where we soon needed to be. At the main terminal, the reader board showed no gate for our connecting flight. After asking several personnel for help, we were directed to the Alaska ticketing area, which was packed, there was no way we would make it to a customer service rep and to whatever gate we needed to be in time. Additionally, we had to leave the secure area to get there. A very kind Alaska agent at a closed station logged back on and directed us to where we needed to be. Back through security, which was a ridiculously long wait, reminded me of Disneyland. We barely made it to the gate and on the plane.

(A Southwest employee said they reason they were so busy was because Sunday was a busy day for international travel). No express lines for those of us who already had our boarding passes and just needed to check our bags. The check-in equipment would not even scan our boarding pass. Once we finished checking in our bags, then came the TSA security lines. No one in line could believe how they had us snaked around the terminal.

2014-07-20,7,10,Seattle Airport customer review,S Koenig,It may reduce congestion but I still don't like the fact that shuttle buses and taxis leave you out in the parking structure across from the terminals and you must go up one floor by elevator then cross a skybridge then descend again. Easy enough if you are without luggage or have just hand luggage but if you are using a cart ($5 of course) it can take a while. Other than that the airport will large is relatively easy to navigate and clean. In most cases it's as quick to walk as to take the airport trains unless you're going to Terminal S (satellite terminal) used by some but not all Delta flights. Decent array of eateries in the airport. To get to the consolidated rental car terminal you must take a shuttle bus (definitely too far to walk).

Also if you are an aviation buff like me the airport is great for spotting both once you are past security and out of the airport.

2013-11-27,8,10,Seattle Airport customer review,Robin Adams,Although the Seatac has a somewhat dated layout with two different trains needed to reach the N and S satellite terminals it is an relatively efficient and professionally run facility compared to most other US airports. For 20 years I was based in PHL and flew 8-12 times a year. For the last 15 years I have been based in SEA. The experience is like night and day. Fundamentally 80-85% of SEA flights run on time while the PHL figure is routinely around 70% and sometimes less. The fundamental requirement of an airport is to have the capacity to land and park arriving flights in a timely manner and similarly dispatch departing flights. There is plenty of data available to determine whether they are doing this and it should be given a heavy weight in any benchmarking/ranking system. There is a good choice of food in a clean and airy central food court with large picture windows and high ceilings. One of my favorites is Vino Volo where it is possible to taste a flight of wines accompanied by light snacks - and they will pack up gift packages for you to take on the plane. Very civilized. Two obvious weaknesses exist and they reflect poor planning. One is the location of the light rail station which is way too far from the terminal. The other is the location of the new car rental terminal which should have been connected to the light rail but has to be reached by a separate bus system. However this lack of co-ordination between different transit agencies is a chronic problem in Washington state.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-11-18,7,10,Seattle Airport customer review,S Koenig,In general a modern clean comfortable airport. My biggest complaint is the fact that to get from the baggage claim area to the courtesy buses for hotels etc. (except for the shuttle bus to the consolidated rental car facility) or from the courtesy buses to the check-in area you have to go up an elevator or escalators cross a sky bridge then descend another elevator. The shuttles stop on the third level of the parking structure. No big deal unless you have lots of bags. If you're departing and are staying at an airport hotel you can ask the hotel to call the Port Authority for permission to drop you off at the curb at the arrivals level (note: permission must be asked maybe half an hour in advance and the permission applies only to those on the request so if others are on the bus they first go to the regular drop-off area and then the bus circles again to drop you off). The area for the courtesy buses is for a variety of such shuttles: those for both parking lots (public and commercial) and hotels. While there are signs showing where each type of bus stops (in 2-3 locations) they tend to group together (with those for commercial parking lots seemingly especially numerous) and you have to be alert and while standing on the curb may have to flag down the shuttle you want especially if it's for a hotel.

Lots of people around and your baggage which could be stolen if not careful. A long walk to the Sound transit is terrible way of an airport to give efficient service furthermore right through a parking garage. Now imagine if you do this at night. Scary.

The check-in desks are spread out and it takes 5 minutes to walk from one end to the other from there the security screening areas are on the opposite side again. Lucky there is a train that shuttles you to the satellite terminals I was expecting to walk. The terminals themselves should be updated in the age of technology SeaTac should update their outlets. Given that only 30% work and the ones that do are located in the most awkward positions. In addition the light rail train is located on the opposite side of the parking garage and does not accept credit cards making you walk all the way back into the middle of the terminal to find an ATM.

This meant I used the airport about 6 times in a week using different terminals so feel well placed to rate it. Immigration lines on arrival were pretty long and immigration officials were characteristically prickly. Airport transfer to downtown via shuttle buses was cheap ($12.50 one way) and efficient. Wi-fi in the airport is completely free and a good connection. Tram connects all the terminals and airport is well sign posted. Trams connecting terminals leave every two minutes and often have announcements in mutiple languages. Restaurants and gift shops either side of security with excellent choice and high quality offered. The only let down is the S terminal.

Well there was a virtually continuous stream of such passengers so many of them got though in only seconds or minutes while us steerage passengers waited an hour to get to the same point. When I finally passed this bottleneck during my long walk to the gate I saw that there were many other much smaller security checkpoints with no lines further on down the hallway that I could have used instead.

The proximity of the light rail station allowing quick and inexpensive access to downtown Seattle is a definite plus (it is located at the far end of the northern parking garage - best to ask for directions). Getting to the airport terminal to check-in can be confusing. Hotel and other courtesy vans let out passengers not next to the terminal but across the access road next to the parking garage. I saw no crosswalks across that road. To get to the main terminal you need to get to one of the elevators in the parking garages to take you to a skywalk (bridge) over the access road to the terminal then find a second elevator to go up to the departures level. We almost rented one of the baggage carts in the parking garage but were glad we used a skycap due to the confusing route to our check-in counter. There seemed to be a dearth of rest rooms in the check-in areas. As noted a bit of a walk to the security line (with special entrance for First Class passengers) then down 2 (more?) escalators to get to the train to the ""S"" terminal for our flight.

2010-05-28,4,10,Seattle Airport customer review,P Cadelina,They have been remodeling this airport for the past 20 years but some things have not changed. The ticket counter check in is old style and cramps the terminal area if heavy flights are queuing. Alaska is the only airline there that I know of with kiosk check in. Security is bad TSA staff is rude compared to other airports. Security area is cramped and not efficient. Long walks to the gate areas except for Alaska who is the main tenant here. There are two satellite terminals connected by an underground tram. International runs out of the south satellite. After customs you have to put your bags on the conveyer then go to baggage claim in the main terminal to reclaim them. Parking is a mess. Rental cars are currently in the parking garage but plans are to move them away which will mean shuttles to and from. Food services are the only bright spot here.

2010-03-07,4,10,Seattle Airport customer review,S McMillan,I’ve been traveling to Seattle quite often. The best thing about the Seattle airport is the fact that they have a Link light rail station connected via walk-way to the airport. For $2.50 I can get from the airport to less than a block away from my corporate office. And for an additional $6.90 I can ride the ferry over to Bainbridge to meet up with my parents. (The ferry is free heading back into Seattle.) I generally fly Virgin America which seems to be assigned gates in Siberia. Rumor has it there are more dining choices at the food court which is good since pick’ins are pretty slim down by the low number gates. There is a Starbucks adjacent to the concourse so at least you can get something there while you are waiting on your flight. The airport itself seems to be clean and well maintained.

2010-01-31,3,10,Seattle Airport customer review,Lijing Han,"Connecting flights coming from overseas? Seattle airport is set up to receive only one type of connecting flight the kind where the airport of origin can tag your bags through to the final destination. However when coming from some developing countries where your final destination (in the US) cannot be on your international itinerary the airports will not tag your bags through to the final destination. As a result when exiting customs in Seattle and given the choice of leaving security or going the route of ""connecting flights"" one should choose to leave security and collect their bags at the baggage claim of their international airlines then recheck in with their domestic airline. If your domestic flight is not on the same itinerary as your international flight (eg. you booked it online but your international flight was bought overseas) then the connecting flight sky hops have no idea where to send your bag (it's not on the tag). The main reason for this is that they ""assume"" your bags are checked through to your final destination. They fail to ask this important question and do not realize that every customer does not have the background to distinguish that there are multiple kinds of ""connecting flights."" However if they do not ask you the airline and CITY where you want your bag to go it will be lost in the airport. The airport is not small and you will be walking back and forth between the international baggage claim and your domestic airlines trying to figure out where the bags went. This is a common problem at this airport as reported to me by the lost baggage clerk in San Diego. He said that military coming from Narita through Seattle have this issue all the time. If the Sky Hop does not ask you where you want your bag to go make sure you tell him. If he says ""we'll take care of everything"" make sure that you discuss the destination as part of the ""everything."" Most likely he will tell you to take your bag off of the conveyer belt that is headed to another airline and put it on the belt that will take it to the international baggage claim. (In Seattle after going through customs the passenger takes a tram to the other terminals but the bags go on special conveyer belts either to the next airplane or to the baggage claim). Please be careful. If you are not you may have a very difficult time finding your bag or anyone who knows where your bag went.",,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-11-20,4,10,Seattle Airport customer review,K Hulick,Seatac is one of the best laid-out US. airports. The main terminal is open and easy to navigate. There is food service on both sides of security. All security lanes go to the same gate areas so you can easily just walk to the shortest station not necessarily the one right by your airline. There are maybe 5 or 6 security stations - quick and efficient (or as efficient as the TSA can be). Parking is challenging with spaces full even on low-traffic days. But the ease of airport navigation makes up for the parking problems.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-10-18,3,10,Seattle Airport customer review,Glenn Dy,SeaTac airport didn't seem to have changed for the better from my very first visit in 2003. It's dark the baggage claim areas confusing ground staff impersonal and cold like the airport's impression itself. I could comment though that after claiming one's baggage the curbside pick-up is very convenient as one does not have to travel a long distance tugging one's luggage to the escalator then onto the parking area. Yes SeaTac's image of personal items being lost seems prevailing till now. I arrived in Guangzhou from Seattle via Incheon where I requested that my baggage be claimed in its final destination which is Guangzhou. When I claimed by luggage in Guangzhou I found out that the locks on one of my two luggages had disappeared and now I have to conduct an inventory of what I had packed inside to confirm if my stuff had been nicked. SeaTac's management should certainly look seriously on this issue as it will definitely be a negative factor in it's image of a city that is really a lovely one with friendly people and green surroundings. The airport just does not do justice to what the city has to offer.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-08-02,2,10,Seattle Airport customer review,Elmore Poulet,SeaTac is big and confusing with a large main terminal and remote satellite terminals out on the tarmac that can only be reached using underground trams. It is very easy for the uninitiated to get lost and it can easily take an extra fifteen minutes once inside security to get to a gate. The parking garage and rental car area are close by and convenient but the outlying parking areas are far away and it is sometimes hard to figure out where to catch the shuttle buses. Ticket lines are not usually too bad but as mentioned elsewhere in this blog the security lines are often very long and waits of forty-five minutes or an hour are not uncommon even at this late date when other airports have figured out how to manage their security lines. Arrive at least two hours early at SeaTac! Also mentioned elsewhere the TSA personnel at SeaTac are right up there with the most surly and rude anywhere definitely on the same level as those at EWR and PHL and that's saying a lot! On the other hand sometimes the lines are really short and if you have extra time to kill the food court with forty foot high windows overlooking the apron activity is a nice place to have lunch. The big wooden rocking chairs are nice! The Alaska Airlines Board Room located just inside security is friendly but can be crowded. One very serious note; SeaTac is very well known for an internal theft problem with items disappearing from checked bags. When you travel through SeaTac you just have to expect to lose things to people that work there. It's a sad commentary on the state of travel today that this problem can't be stopped.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-07-19,1,10,Seattle Airport customer review,L Hunter,"Firstly as an international visitor I tried to find a Sea-Tac employee OR an information desk - someone who could tell me what the correct process was in terms of locating my baggage and clearing it through customs before finding the gate to my connecting flight. No information desk to be found and no obvious employee to approach with my questions. No signage that would indicate my flight arrival number and corresponding luggage carousel no signage that indicated how/where I could find the Terminal for my connecting flight (finally stumbled on an escalator that took me down one level and discovered that there is a small subway/monorail to transport passengers to other Terminals within the airport). I did approach two airline employees to see if they could assist me with my confusion; but alas - they seemed almost as equally confused and were definitely ""cranky"". Finally made it all the way to the Terminal for my connecting flight and thought I would kill some time by checking out their complimentary wireless internet connection. Tried to connect several times and was unsuccessful. Boarding time finally arrived and I had my boarding pass and picture ID checked by the agent at my Gate and was cleared to take the ramp and board my plane. Trouble was - the ramp had no less than 4 doors/exits leading off of it - each one leading to a different plane to board. There was mass confusion with passengers going off in all directions and get this - only two destination signs for four flights and neither of these signs (Edmonton and Santa Rosa) matched my destination (Vancouver). There were three of us who ended up on the wrong plane initially and had to exit the plane back-track the ramp and find an airline attendant who could motion us towards the correct plane! Seems as there is a long history of passengers complaining about the lack of signage.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-05-17,5,10,Seattle Airport customer review,Mike Rosenzweig,Lots to do prior to your flight - great food court and shops and food prices are not rip offs. International arrivals are pleasant too - fast immigration and customs personnel. Only downside is after customs you have to drop you luggage off again so that it goes to the main terminal while you take the tram to the main terminal. This is bad because when you get to the main terminal you have to pay to use luggage carts. Overall Seattle is a great airport!,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-03-26,5,10,Seattle Airport customer review,John Wagner,I just returned to the States from SE Asia this past week and went through Immigration & Customs in Seattle for the first time. What a pleasant and speedy experience (when compared to San Francisco or New York). The agents actually smiled! I had a fairly tight connection to Portland but Seattle is so efficient I made the flight easily and I even had to go through a complete check-in and security scan since I was on multiple tickets. The only thing I have to complain about at Seattle is Anthony's Seafood Restaurant - overpriced and of mediocre quality! I will transit Seattle Seatac on my next foreign trip for sure - what a pleasure.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-01-06,5,10,Seattle Airport customer review,B Reger,I change planes in Seattle several times a year. Great food court. Terminal announcements are non-existant but the electronic boards are kept reasonably up to date. Worst connection is Satellite N to the main Alaska terminal. If it is a tight connection you need to hustle. International arrivals are not too bad. Much more pleasant than New York Chicago or SFO. You can clear Canadian customs before boarding your flight to Canada. Little congestion. Generally friendly people. Not perfect but better than many.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-11-07,1,10,Seattle Airport customer review,Sarah Bush,Seatac has a terrible international arrival terminal. We arrived from Paris on our Air France flight. The customs lines were fairly long and it took a while to get our luggage. No real explanation just hundreds of Americans Europeans and other nationalities in the luggage area. The only non-english announcement I heard was in German. After having spent two weeks in Eurpoe we were very spoiled that many Europeans spoke a little english. We missed 2 flights because airport employees were telling us and many others we could go out and come back in when they had no business giving half correct instructions.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-10-06,3,10,Seattle Airport customer review,I Krisnanto,First time arriving on an international flight at SEA I found the process quite efficient and nice compared to other major US airports. The immigration line was short and fast and the luggage came out quite quickly. The only issue was that we had to clear customs at the satellite terminal and then re-deposited our luggage to be picked up again at the main terminal. Departing was also a straightforward process though the check in and security lines were significantly longer. But it seemed that the airport staff was ready for it and the lines moved swiftly.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-07-28,3,10,Seattle Airport customer review,Paul Browne,Admittedly this is the first time that I have transited Seatac but I found the process very onerous. Arriving on a Lufthansa flight from Europe and connecting with an AC flight to Vancouver - a process that took 3 hours! Immigration Control was slow and as Canadian citizens we were not advised that we could use the Areas 5 and 6 reserved for US citizens until we were well into the lineup. Once dealt with by a very pleasant officer we had to go thru TSA inspection which took a while by more pleasant officers (did u know that there were regulation sized plastic bags for your liquids??? I sure didn't!) and then had to take 3 count 'em three trains to get to the North Satellite where our Jazz aircraft departed from! And we only made it because of a helpful United Airlines employee - certainly not because of any useful signage! We probably wouldn't choose to travel via SEA again if we could help it it was far too stressful.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
