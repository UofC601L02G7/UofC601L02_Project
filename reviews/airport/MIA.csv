When we moved over to the next line because the one we were in directed us to, the other rep yelled at us and said she had customers waiting before us. Are we not also her customers that were waiting? She then glared at us and was whispering to another rep about us. Condescending and rude to travelers. They were laughing at people trying to get through, including airline crew and airport staff for being frustrated. This causes anger and frustration and a poor overall mood for passengers when good and positive attitudes would support happy and positive travelers and less issues on airplanes. Embarrassed for this country with international travelers when other countries are kind and calm to travelers because they know it is important for commerce, mental health, and relations with other people.

Also I had to pick up my luggage and drop it for the connection flight something I never had to do with any other airline. We traveled with American Airlines (not recommended) after getting through all of this we had to walk miles again to get to our gate which was at the very end of the hallway only to let us know that we had lost our flight and there was nothing to do other than placing us at a standby list and hope for the best only because it wasn’t the airline fault. According to the American airlines agent this had to do with the controllers and the air traffic so they wouldn’t offer us a hotel room or food just because this was the airport fault. We ended up spending a whole night there where we couldn’t even get a bag of chips because they got rid of vending machines so they have no food options passed 11 pm.

It's more akin to a leap backwards into an era where charm and functionality are myths, and cramped, outdated spaces are the harsh reality.  The staff ability to maintain an aura of indifference in the face of any question or plea for help is truly commendable. It's as if they've taken the concept of 'the cold shoulder' and elevated it to an art form. Navigating the airport is akin to participating in an escape room you never signed up for. The layout is so cramped and convoluted. It’s clear the design was inspired by a labyrinth, with a dash of ""let's see how many people we can confuse before noon."" Calling it 'old and dated' is a kindness. It's as if the airport is stuck in a bygone era, stubbornly refusing to join us in the 21st century. The charm of yesteryear has certainly overstayed its welcome here. But the pièce de résistance has to be the TSA security clearance - a spectacle so inefficient and embarrassing, it deserves its own reality TV show. The TSA staff, not wanting to be outdone by their airport colleagues, take rudeness to new heights, skirting the line of abusiveness with a finesse that would make a drill sergeant blush. It's a process so fraught with frustration, you'd think it was designed as a test of human endurance. In an era where digital connectivity is akin to oxygen, MIA somehow manages to turn free WiFi into a luxury item. Thanks to the generosity of American Express, passengers can access the internet, provided they have the patience to sit through ads. It's a charming reminder of the dial-up era, a nostalgic throwback that no one asked for. The concept of passenger experience seems to be an alien one at MIA. From the lack of food outlets to the scarcity of lounges, it's as if they're pioneering a new minimalist approach to airport amenities - less is more, and in the case of MIA, much less. In conclusion, if you're seeking an airport experience that combines the charm of a Soviet-era bus station with the efficiency of a sloth, look no further than Miami International Airport. It's an adventure you won't forget, no matter how hard you try. I wholeheartedly advise anyone to avoid this horrible, dingy, old, awful airport at all costs.

After a bit of confusion and me having done most of the regular line, eventually someone came and handed us the orange cards and we went into a separate queue. The short connection queue was still quite long, so I requested one of the staff if he could organise it prioritising those with flights leaving earliest, like my own. I was understandably quite nervous about missing my flight, as I was travelling with my mother, a senior with a disability. The gentleman said he couldn’t do anything and that I had to wait, I insisted that the system was making little sense but was in no way disrespectful.

Restrooms not serviced - no paper towels or air dryers. Transportation services not available - the train was not operable; the golf carts were sitting unused with no driver. This was in Terminal D which is almost a mile long. When we arrived on an international flight we had an extremely long walk to customs and there were no chairs in which to rest.  There were unreasonably long distances to walk to immigration and customs - sometimes the signs sent domestic and international passengers in different directions, only for them to join again.

Wheelchairs and transport buses running where people walk! Gate signs don't make sense. I had to ask people where to find everything. Loud speaker sometimes can't be heard, sometimes loud. Terrible!! Where is our tax payer money going. It's certainly not going to this place. Governor DeSantis needs to overhaul the management.

My flight from Dallas Love Field arrived in the G Concourse which reminds me of the old New York LaGuardia terminal. Low ceilings, narrow walkways, dirty, dark, interior. I made my way to ground transportation which was a nightmare. The signage is confusing and with the proliferation of ride share apps like Uber, Lyft, etc., one would think there would be ample signage. The entire ground transportation area is confusing, with inadequate signage. Then, there are the airport staff. I had trouble getting a Lyft, and decided to take a cab. The cab driver told me that since I was going to Hilton Airport Blue Lagoon, I had to take a “blue” taxi. I asked an airport ground transportation worker for directions and he pointed and said, “at the end.” I never found the blue taxi and finally ended up waiting for my hotel’s courtesy van for another 30 minutes.  Upon arrival back to the airport for my departing flight, the same chaos ensued. I arrived at the airport at 8:00 a.m. for my 11:55 a.m. flight back to Dallas. Since I had time to spare, I went to the Star Alliance Lounge between H and J. Security checkpoint was horrible. Crowded, confusing, and I was in the line for the TSA Pre-Check which they were merging with the CLEAR and general security screening. Employees are brash, if not just downright rude. The walkway between H and J was much nicer; except for the restrooms. Wow - I think they imported these from old gas stations. Dark, dirty, in disrepair. I finally made my way to the Star Alliance Lounge. The entrance to the elevator from the concourse level is two double doors that made me think I was going into the back kitchen of an old diner. Followed, by a dirty elevator with taped signage directing me to the lounge. The walk from the elevator to the lounge entrance made me think I was in the wrong place, but I kept walking and eventually found it.

Now I flew American Airlines, which actually never took my bag off the flight so my bags ended up being sent to Vegas. I know that the problem is more with American Airlines and not the airport, but when trying to get help on where to go and who to talk to I was met with great resistance. No one wanted to help and after spending over four hours trying to find where my bag was I eventually left and gave up. The workers in the airport were incompetent. I never once raised my voice or had an angry attitude towards a worker, because I know that it’s not their fault that my bags were lost. However, I waited in baggage claim line for 45min waiting to get an answer on where my bag was. When I got to the front, the associate refused to scan my baggage slip and told me to go look in a pile of bags I already looked through. After telling the associate I had already gone through all the bags with other associates she just waived her hand at me to leave. The airport layout is horrendous and it feels like a run down mall instead of an airport. Everything is dirty and the seat availability is absolutely slim. There is very little seating for people who have to wait for flights. Even on a day with little to no delays you find yourself either shoulder to shoulder with someone or sitting on the floor. On my departure trip back to the airport I arrived, come to find out instead of holding my bag they lost for me to recheck, they sent it on a flight back to Dallas after we had already discussed over the phone I would pick it up myself in Miami. I got to the airport at approximately 8:30am and my flight didn’t board until 3:00pm. Since I was coming from a cruise I didn’t have much option but to wait in the airport. Since I entered the terminal there was a loud alarm that stated “may we have your attention”, “the current alarm in being investigated by the fire department, please standby for more instructions.” This alarm continued to go off every minute even after I got on my flight to leave. I understand the safety of having alarms, but it sounded like it had been going off for days. Seating was again slim and the restrooms were absolutely disastrous. Overall, if you plan on spending anytime at all at an airport make sure it is not in Miami. For an international airport I am shocked at how horrendous the experience is.

Initial customs was not bad but then everyone was screened again! Usually they spot check but today, there was one PO’d girl checking passports and only one screening lane open. A guy was walking back and forth saying to put tablets and computers separate and shoes and belts off. The crowd was getting impatient when some young group cut the line. A supervisor was called out and they were sent back after some yelling and shouting. Finally another lane opened right as we were up front. Then as we were taking shoes and belts off the agent said “why are you pulling your computers out?” I had the regrettable audacity to inform him the the other agent was shouting those instructions to the crowd. That annoyed him so we stuffed the laptop and tablet back into their case and moved on to baggage claim and re-check.so why don’t they screen all bags again if all people are being scanned again after being in a contained environment?

We travel internationally a couple of times a year and have never had to go back through screening after clearing customs and immigration. Maybe rules have changed, but the TSA was overwhelmed. It was kind of sad actually. Dozens and dozens of passengers from any airline coming through on 2/20 in the evening, missed their connections due to poorly trained and poorly supervised personnel.

Once in the gate area, there is almost no where to charge electronic devices in the gate areas besides one desk with two electrical outlets. The American Airlines customer service was terrible and had multiple gate changes. The gates in this airport can also be extremely far apart and one gate change took almost 15 minutes to walk to without an easier and accessible way to speed this up such as a walking escalator. I ordered food at Wendy’s thinking this would be the quickest possible food and gave up waiting for my food after I had been waiting for 30 minutes.

We were shouted into a queue to take our photo and fingerprints on a machine and then shouted at again to get into yet another queue with hundreds of people waiting to see a Customs Officer. We were told to present a copy of the photo we already had taken at the machine. He did exactly the same thing as we had already done and took yet another photo but, this time taking fingerprints of both hands. What an absolute joke this airport is. The rudeness of one of the officials astounded us. He must have been an ex serviceman or police officer in a former life. He was aggressive and treated everybody as if they were 10 years old.

But guess what, even though one hallway was clearly marked with a D (and an arrow) it had a barrier across the entrance and a big floor sign: No Admittance. So back we went to the main corridor, where we saw directional arrows for Gates D-E etc, so down that corridor we race, looking for an American Rebooking desk. None in sight, anywhere, despite this being a major American hub. Stopped at one gate that was staffed and asked where the rebooking desk was, and was told it was something like D-37 or D-3, and then the agent volunteered that one might be a little closer, so off in that direction we ran. When we finally got there, we were told that the doors had already been closed (never mind that it would have been about a 15 minute walk to get there anyway). So we resigned ourselves to an interminable wait down near D-1, where a bottled beer was ""only"" $10.50, not counting tax and a ""suggested tip of $1.50."" When it finally was near time for the departure for the later flight, suddenly there was a flurry of activity at the adjacent gates, when apparently four American flights were to depart within 15 minutes of one another from gates D-1 to D-5. And since there seemed to be only one PA, the assembled passengers became understandably restless when the gate attendant announced ""we are now boarding Groups 1 and 2"" without bothering to state the destination or flight number. Confusing? You bet. Especially when said announcement was drowned out by another PA telling ""passenger XXX, please report to the gate."" Final boarding began when five wheelchairs were rolled to the plane, followed very quickly by anyone who simply showed his/her boarding pass and walked aboard.

The plane was delayed 15 minutes on the tarmac and then 10 more at the gate when no agent was available to operate the entryway. Then, there was an interminable walk through unmarked hallways to an interminable immigration line. There, after being herded to the automated kiosks, I was herded to wait over 40 minutes for an agent who was gleefully asking smug questions of every U.S. citizens in line, spending an average of 5 minutes with each person. Other lines moved more quickly at this point, so this is clearly a particular agent’s power trip. At this point, when I tried to find where to re-check my luggage, an agent rudely asked me for when my connnection was. This was the first time I was asked about my connection time, notwithstanding the “short layover” stickers that had been plastered all over my suitcase. At this point, the rude American Airlines employee told me to go to a different line from the one which I was standing, with now explanation. I assumed, incorrectly, that this was an expedited line, since I still had around 40 minutes to catch my flight. It was not. The door that the rude agent sent me through took me outside of security to the airline agents for rebooking. I learned from another agent that I had been sent there because other agents decided that the remaining 40 minutes was not sufficient for me to make my connection. And, throughout the process, the half-dozen or so staff members that I had the misfortune of interacting with were extraordinarily rude and impassive to the fact that they were part of an inefficient and abusive machine that was making thousands of passengers miserable.

We waited in customs for another hour - at this point our plane had already started boarding for Richmond. After making it through the customs checks, there were 6 other customs officers sitting around talking and laughing (twiddling their thumbs) Maybe they could have helped open up more lanes in customs? No - poor management. To add on top of all of this, the one line was full of Miami residents that did not need to make a connecting flight. Maybe they could have opened up a different line for solely connecting flights? No - poor management. After customs we then had to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and recheck our luggage!

2019-02-15,1,10,"""worst airport in the modern world""",John Hallam,"✅ Trip Verified | The worst airport I’ve ever had to navigate. We had a 3 hours layover where we were coming in from London. 1. Air traffic control had us circle for 20 minutes. Ok, that happens. 2. Once we landed we were stuck on the tarmac for 40 minutes due to another plane not having docked correctly? and lack of communication regarding which gates the preceding planes were to be at. This doesn’t really happen much, so it was frustrating. 3. We had to go through two different rounds of security screening before having to pick up our checked bags. At the first one, even though we’re had the mobile passport completed, there was no line for mobile passport and with 6 kiosks only 2 were open; one exclusively for crew and global entry with the other for everyone else. 4. We had to then collect our luggage, which took another 30 minutes, to be randomly selected to have them rummage through our things. 5. Once they unfolded everything and left it a mess we were dismissed and sent towards the exit. We then had to recheck our bags at the airline desk which was on a different level and a long way away. Luckily, an airline staff member allowed us to skip the line and simply drop the bags. This was the one person who was helpful; airline staff. 6. Next we had to go through airport security again, however, this time it was the same security you go through if you were just arriving to the airport. Keep in mind we had just gotten off of an airplane here at the airport. Once in the line we got to hurry up and wait while 6 TSA employees condescendingly yelled at everyone. Nothing helpful from them, just threats to slow the line if their power-trip-orders weren’t obeyed. If someone failed to zip up their backpack before sending it through the scanner, instead of asking them to zip it, the person was chastised in front of the crowd. 7. The line of travelers constantly growing while the Walmart approach (having many registers with only one open) was adopted by the TSA staff. One screening conveyor belt was in use while 3 others were closed. With the exception of the lady who was running the conveyor belt, who would not make eye contact with anyone even when asked why my sealed clear bag from the duty free store back in a London was set aside. Nope, my duty free items needed to be taken out and run through another scanner. 8. What was the rest of the TSA staff doing? Literally walking around in circles not know who was supposed to do what. I heard “hey, who is on this one?” And “I though so and so was supposed to be here still” along with other statements that really reassured me our safety was the priority and was being handled by professionals. 9. We were reassured that once through this last “security” check that the gate was literally just up another escalator. Nope. Next we had to jump on yet another shuttle. 10. What’s the best part of this whole experience. The arrival gate (e24) was in the same terminal as the departure gate (e31). All of that fuss was to go through customs. In short, this is the worst airport in the modern world to deal with and I will gladly pay more to fly through another airport in the future so that I can avoid this from happening again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'February 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

When you stand in a queue for an hour and 15 minutes with no access to a toilet and nowhere to sit it leaves a bad taste. I have to remind myself as meander like I’m in a queue at Disney that we are meant to be in the most advanced 1st world country on earth. I mean the citizens of this country landed men on the moon 50 years ago and sent satellites to the furthest edges of our solar system yet they can’t efficiently push people through airport arrivals. So after an hour and 15 minutes in a queue we were put into an area of robotic machines by semi robotic staff. One must put the four fingers of one hand on a glass plate on the machine, feed their passport into a slot and look at a light for the machine to take your photograph as if you are facing prison. The machine then spits out a paper ticket with your photo and passport details. In our case although the ticket told us to proceed out one of the semi robotic staff put us to another darn queue. This one took another 45 minutes and when we got to the counter we got to do it all over again. That’s to say, fingerprinted, photographed and passport examined. So what moron thinks it’s a good idea to push hundreds of people to machines only to then put them to human beings to do the exact same thing all over again? Insane duplication and a complete waste of time. I think the Germans call this verschlimmbesserung. So two hours with no access to water, toilet or a seat and to make matters much much worse was that whenever airline crew arrived they got preference over us to go through immigration with no consideration for the fact we’d been standing for hours. When I arrived at the airport I had a lot of sympathy for the folks working here because with the 21st century reincarnation of PT Barnum in the White House they weren’t getting paid but by the time I was standing an hour I felt I wouldn’t pay them either.

We arrived at the airport about 9.30 am and our flight was not until 2.00 pm so we had 4.5 hours to spend at the airport and we were not impressed with the experience. Upon getting off the transfer bus, we were directed to an outdoor counter to check our bags. This counter had minimal protection from the weather and we would have been quite uncomfortable if it had been raining or if we had been there mid-day in the hot sun. As others have mentioned, the cost of simple drink and snack options is extremely expensive. Several outlets did not even post prices but just a menu with a list of options. We settled on a coke, coffee and sandwich from the Starbucks outlet situated near gate D32. This location was convenient, well staffed and very clean.

However, the chaos began as soon as we arrived at the Miami airport. My ticket was pre-check as we thought all four would be since they were all booked under my name as the lead person. We were instructed to go to the two different check-points. After being turned around twice, I informed the young lady that we had gone through this twice. If we had to come back, a manager is going to have to get involved. She instructed us to go back to checkpoint three because” the staff member there was new and didn’t know what she was telling us.” We went back, and sure enough, the staff member began to tell us to separate again. I told her what the previous employer had said to us, she pulled up our ticket on her phone and told us to go ahead.

We finally arrived at our gate for departure. As we sat there trying to listen for the changes of gates. The intercom system is not the best; one could barely hear the changes. We saw so many travelers missing their flight and upset, as they should have been. The announcement should have been clear, and anyone on that flight name should have been called before that plane departed. I felt bad for those that were unable to hear the message in the mist of all the chaos. I’m sure that with all the upgrades in technology the intercom system can be much better, employee interaction should be superior.

Our flight was delayed by 5 hours because the captain was unable to arrive at the Miami airport due to the weather in Tampa, which is completely reasonable. However, the situation could've been handled much better. The people that worked outside the gate were unhelpful. They pretty much expected everyone to have smart phones and therefore were negligent in giving us, customers, regular updates as to when our flight will arrive. They only updated people who stood waiting in line for 15 minutes, instead of just efficiently announcing it to the general public, not that their updates were helpful to the individuals that stood in line because they kept pushing it to every hour, so it was very hard for customers to plan accordingly. By giving us an incorrect ETA, we were not able to decide whether to rebook to another flight or not. If we had known that the flight was going to be delayed for 5 hours, we would've gotten on a different flight. But the people at the gate kept ensuring us that it would only be an hour delayed, and then another hour if we asked again and again. This misinformation is unacceptable.

As always the staff shout at you like they are herding cattle. Departures: Check-in is simple and well signposted, queues are short as there are a lot of desks. Security takes a while, the priority line is not much shorter than the main lines. As with most Americans the staff are very rude and unpleasant. One of them pointed at me and shouted ""shoes"" whilst another shook his head and announced to the waiting line ""we shouldn't have to tell y'all the obvious"".

Once through security I can't say the airport was dirty but the amenities were very limited as was the seating. Once home I also noticed that the TSA cut the security belt around my suitcase open with bolt cutters, even when it had a TSA lock.

I also put a special cloth sleeve around my suitcase to protect it from wear and scratches which I didn't even bother putting back on. When waiting, there is free WiFi but only for 45 minutes.

Really, don’t American citizens deserve an easier entry into their own country? After waiting patiently in line for 3/4 hr, got to a passport machine where my passport was read and got a receipt with an X on it, I guess they could not believe I had nothing to declare, hence I was placed into another line where a real agent would re review my entry. Waited another 15 minutes and while waiting I noticed that most agent run kiosks were assigned to X passengers. Well if this the case, why bother with the machines, they cost money and they are useless. Finally, the agent called me and he seemed very nice, talkative and accomodating. He was sure to ask me if I had anything to declare which I responded: ‘maybe a cold’. Overall uneventful but why the bureacracy, can we not do better?

While waithing at the Business line for the security check at least three wide-body aircraft crews (= min 75 to 80 crew) were bypassed and led thru the business checks (on most other airports I have seen dedicated crew security lanes). When it was finally my turn I was redirected to the economy lane and had to wait again. At the x-ray machine there were no bins and when I dared to point this out to the TSA staffI was rebuked with “didn't you hear me!? I already called this out twice! bins are on their way”. The entire process took over 45 minutes. After the security check, the food court service staff was pleasant but the janitors and cleaning crew were very unattentive with litter piling up on many tables. Once they did come around they cleared tables even while patrons were still eating their food. Tables were not wiped and felt very sticky obviously not having been cleaned for some time.

But all things considered the airport is better than it used to be. Tip: If you don't have access to a lounge or have a few hours to kill there is an open air cafe/bar on the top floor of the Hotel that we used to go to.

I travel worldwide and it was one of the worst airports I have seen. Flew Iberia out of the E wing. Once you go past security there is very little in the way of food options or shops. It consisted of Pizza Hut, a small beer place, and two freestanding snack stands. That was it. When I got out to the actual gate, there was nothing. There were a few ""stores"" but they weren't open and I don't know if they are even functional. It was for a 5.30pm flight which ended up being delayed. There were bathrooms, and seating, but nothing else. Everything was closed up. There were 4 different gates where I was. There was a business class lounge not too far for Iberia business passengers, or American Airlines. At this area they did have a duty free shop which was small. The waiting area was fairly clean and the seats were comfortable enough. You have 30 minutes of free wifi after that you have to pay for it. I was early for my flight so the line to go through security and waiting to check in were not long. I had to take a short train to get out to the gates. This airport is serious need of an overhaul.

Last time we did this was in 2006 and it wasn't a great experience with a lot of building work, long immigration queues, offsite car hire, etc. So I was extremely apprehensive. What a difference 10 years makes. We were off of the plane and into a very small queue for the automated machines (not sure what they are called) but there was at least 20 of them so the queue moved quickly, five minutes at most. Once that was done (another five minutes) we were directed to the manual booths because our daughter had just changed her passport. There was no queue whatsoever. Another five minutes of her having her fingerprints done and photo taken and we were off to baggage collection where we waited for 30 minutes for our bags to arrive. A ten minute walk to the train / shuttle which takes you to the car hire / transportation hub where again there were very short lines. I think two people were in front of us. My guess is we were off the plane, through immigration and in the parking garage in just over an hour tops. Amazing. Having read about Orlando I have to say that I think I'd prefer to do this again and then spend four hours driving up than be stuck for hours at MCO being shouted at.

The immigration process is laughable, poor signage, really unhelpful staff, automated ESTA machines, queues upon queues. We were queueing for around 3 hours (and was informed this was a quiet period) just to get a customs and immigration officer who could have hardly cared less. Not one question,  just more photos. All this time your baggage has been unloaded from the conveyor belt and left lying around 'unattended' which surely goes against the regular tannoys you hear at every airport but obviously not applicable to Miami. After that came the trek for the car rental. Don't be fooled by the $5 dollar baggage cart as that will only get you a short bit of the way before you're obliged to ditch it and then haul all your belongings the rest of the way to the rental terminal which is conviently located as far away as humanly possible without leaving the airport zip code. Again met by people who obviously don't wish to be there. 2 weeks later and departure was no better. The only saving grace was car rental returns was quick and painless but again hauling your luggage back through to departures where you're again met with partially automated check in, queues and unhelpful staff.

First, flying AA/Iberia the bags had an ""ITI orange tag"" and so they were transferred from the AA flight to Iberia flight. As said on the Miami airport website this is depending on airlines and destinations, but it's not true that you have always to pick up your bags during a transit. Secondly, in the period between 7.30pm/8pm few flights were landing from ""non US airports"", so we arrived at APC kiosks with many of them free, so in 10 minutes we were queuing to have the stamp from the officer. Then, it starts the usual ""not so good"" part because: Signs are not ok when you leave immigration, because in reality following signs you would probably come to leave the airport since there are arrows for connecting flights moving you outside the terminal when in reality you have to follow the AA connecting flights indications (despite our flight was Iberia for the next leg). Metal detectors/body scanner for the connecting flights are few so you need at least to add 20/30 minutes in your calculation (and again the airport was quite empty at that time). So, in general our experience has been positive overall, because 45 minutes from leaving a first flight to the departure gates again seems a very good ""score"", in general however I also understand the other reviews because during busy times/hours especially the connecting part/metal detectors seems not adequate to manage thousands of people.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Then we proceeded to another endless line to another group of kiosks for customs that were for re entry. There were no instructions just lines, no assistance at the kiosks as well. It was a free for all. After we got our picture taken by the machine, we then waited in line to get into another line to wait to go through customs with a live person. After he went through our kiosk sheets and declaration we went through some doors and had to retrieve our luggage. I have never had to do this before and found it ridiculous. The baggage area was all spread out, there were no clear indicators of what flights they came from and many luggage were taken off the belt and scattered in clusters. It took a while to even find my bag which had my lost and found tag missing. Once we found our bags in the mess they call baggage claim, we stood in another enormous line to go through another live person. By then I had less than an hour left until my connecting flight took off. We finally got through and the person who told us how easy it would be was lying. No one was at the end to take our bags and direct us to the next flight. I was separated from my sister and put in a rescheduled flights line. A person who worked there saw me asked where I was going and took me out of line. I was shoved out of the customs/international area to the front of the airport with my bags. A person out there checked in my bag for me and told me to run with less than 30 min before my flight took off. I was told to run to go through screening again. Then had to cut in line because my flight was to depart in less than 15 min. Once I went through, my departing gate was at the other end of the building. No one was willing to give me a ride on the carts when I asked either. So my pregnant self, had to run/walk to the other end. I was out of breath and stressed when I arrived at my gate.

Then we stood in an even longer line to actually go through immigration stations with live attendants that seemed to look and function exactly like every immigration station I've ever gone through in the US. I saw absolutely no benefit to the APC function. To make it even worse - there were 2 stations for the 75 percent of incoming passengers who were US citizens. However if you were a foreign national or had got an X on your receipt from the wonderful machines, there were over a dozen stations for you and you were probably sipping a mojito in your hotel while the US citizens were still waiting in line. 1 hour 40 minutes from landing to exiting customs. In the past year I've been in 30 countries and 70+ airports including Beijing, Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi, Delhi and Miami was the worst for immigration.

2015-08-20,1,10,Miami Airport customer review,Jane Bennett,"The most awful airport I have been to. It took 3.5 hours to clear immigration. People were queuing everywhere, no help from any staff, passengers shouting, swearing due to the lack of assistance and organisation by airport officials. We were treated like animals. It would not have been so bad if we had been given any information by immigration officials but we had nothing, nobody could tell us anything. All staff were just standing still being rude to anyone who dare asked a question. Children crying, some sleeping on the floor, disgraceful. When we finally cleared immigration we had to queue around the baggage hall for a further 30 mins to clear customs. Never visiting Miami airport again.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2015-08-14,1,10,Miami Airport customer review,Diana Pincott,"This is the worst airport I've experienced as a business traveller. Avoid it at all costs. Unclear signage for ESTA waiver program, coupled with inaccurate advice by officials on where to queue should you arrive with an ESTA. Immigration queue was endless, sped up slightly when I left the visitor queue, went to the automated machines for a receipt and joined a shorter queue. Immigration took two hours and I was only transiting. Signage for transit passengers after customs was unclear. Officials present were uninterested in dealing with passengers enquiry and provided curt answers in the most grumpy way. The queues at the TSA security check were also long, with an official standing at the entrance to the queue proclaiming to passengers that any duty free alcohol purchase should be in sealed bags. It was like a pantomime. I had a three-hour layover and just about made it to the D gates on the sky train for my connecting flight to Central America. On my return trip on a Sunday afternoon, the immigration queue was shorter since I went straight to the automated machines for a receipt. The TSA security check area was even more chaotic, this time with the addition of body scanning and body search. Officials seemed more interested in talking to each other rather than doing their job. The airport management need to rethink the signage and the queue management system and consider some customer service training for their staff.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Even a small storm is enough to grind the airport to a completely halt as was the case with us. Staff were completely disorganised and didn't have a clue, they often gave us conflicting advice. Queues going into the horizon, we ended up queuing for 9 hours and sleeping on the airport floor.

2015-08-10,1,10,Miami Airport customer review,Rob Knauer ,"Bording in Belize wasn't bad, but due to poor weather we were diverted to a non-customs airport (Ft. Myers, FL) instead of Miami to refuel and sit on the ground for 2 hours with no water or restrooms, then cleared for Miami where we got in 2.5 hours late, missed our connecting American Airlines flight. We sought out all the RedJack Customer Service agents there, but every last one of them was either overwhelmed or rude, speaking very poor English and several times directed not just us, but all of the 20 or so people in our group to wrong parts of the airport so that the airline could accommodate us - which they did not. Most of us in our group (us included) decided to forgo our flight from Miami to Orlando, and rent a rental car and drive the five hour drive to OIA instead. Will never fly through Miami again. This was the 5th time we have flown via Miami International Airport, and every time we have been delayed, inconvienced, or dealt with poorly by employees at this location.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2015-08-06,2,10,Miami Airport customer review,D Bonnet,"The queue at customs and immigration are ridiculous, customs officers are all unnecessarily rude to passengers, speaking Spanish only. There's very little signage and no international transit line, so even though we didn't need to collect our bags, it took close to 3hrs to clear customs and we missed our flight despite the 2hr layover. Then had to queue 3 more hours to the AA ticketing desk as another 500 people apparently had missed their connection too. We left at 2am after a 5 hr 30 min ordeal as AA reps were still helping the remaining passengers. Speaking to the staff around the terminal, that's a frequent occurrence at weekends. Airline staff were very helpful but we've never seen such attitude and shambolic process from the US Customs.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Transit', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-08-05,1,10,Miami Airport customer review,E Pritchard,"Going through customs was a nightmare, while there were several extra machines that could've been opened that officers were too busy taking photos or talking. I watched and overheard another customer finally flag down an officer, concerned they were going to miss their next flight putting them off schedule for the flight following, to which the officer rudely told the customer they would just have to be patient and that the airport was doing all they could to expedite the process. Getting luggage when going through customs is a nightmare and I now chose to only bring a carry on, no matter how much it weighs. I travel with an ESA to which an officer pushed aside with her foot and who's leash I was forced to remove by another officer before going through metal detector meaning I had to go through the metal detector, grab my bag and belongings from the conveyor belt while bent over holding my ESA's harness. Once out of customs I checked the boards to confirm the gate on my boarding pass was still correct, to which the boards confirmed it was. Not having a lot of extra time after my customs experience, I headed straight to the gate and sat to wait. However, as the time grew closer to boarding I noticed there were not a lot of passengers even though the board above the counter said my flight. When I asked at the counter I was informed that the gate had been changed and they hadn't gotten around to changing it, and that I should've been better prepared and downloaded the airport app since the boards couldn't be trusted. After receiving a lecture from the desk clerk he then gave me directions to the gate and told me he would call ahead to tell them I was coming as fast as possible. Following his directions, I discovered he had sent me to the wrong terminal, so I then reboard the tram and raced to the gate at which there was no one managing the counter and I watched my plane's doors close and take off 5 minuets early. Since this was the last flight to my final location I had to spend the night in Miami and was rebooked on the earliest flight out the next morning. When I arrived at the airport the next morning around 5 am, 2.5 hours before my flight, I found 1 security line open with people backed up to the doors that lead to the outside. Once I finally got to the front of the line I had a security officer refuse to allow my ESA to pass until I fully removed his harness, make him sit and wait while I passed through the metal detector. Once finally through they changed my gate twice, neither of which were on the boards.

Whilst gathered in concourse F there was a chaotic element to food service and rudeness too. Not a great start for our first visit to this airport. It got worse. The ladies' restroom in this concourse was in a deplorable state, dirty and used paper hand towels strewn on the floor, an abandoned cleaner's cart, no paper roll in the individual cubicles leading to disgust and abandonment from many ladies. What a way to showcase your airport Miami. I did a twitter note about this and received a reply that the situation would be dealt with. Hopefully subsequent passengers benefitted but there seemed to be no management presence or care on the floor and that is a shameful state of affairs. I would not visit this airport again by choice and would choose to travel to another airport to avoid it.

2015-08-02,2,10,Miami Airport customer review,Gilbert Schwartz,"I arrived at MIA North Terminal on AA39 on August 1 2015 at approximately 9.00 pm. The people mover car used for transiting from the plane to the customs area had no functioning air conditioning. None of the escalators down to the customs arena were functioning. Although I participate in the “Global Entry” program, the receipt was marked “X” which required me to stand in line for an officer’s review. The agent on duty left his post to explain to others in line what would be permitted and not permitted through this entry point. This caused further unnecessary delay. There was clearly poor judgment in allocation of customs personnel duties. There was an inordinately long wait for my luggage to arrive at the carrousel. After retrieving my luggage there was an extremely long line filing through the maze to arrive at the exit. I presented my “X” entry pass and passport, I found the officer to be rude in his tone and very unwelcoming. Overall, this experience at MIA was extremely unpleasant.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

There was not enough time in between the flights given the uneccesarily long and multistage process that they put you for combined with how far away the airport is. We had a 2 hour layover and we almost did not make thw flight. We had to run to make final boarding call! 2 hrs should be enough. If it isn't change it!

Going through customs, my boyfriend and I asked an employee about the permanent resident line, she simply yelled at us to stay in line. Another employee proceeded to tell me there were two lines, and to ""move it"" and then tells me I cut the line. Yelling at me in Spanish, to get off and the line. Now, I understood a little cause I speak Portuguese, but I'm not fluent in Spanish. I kept asking her to tell me what was wrong, and she proceeded to yell at me in Spanish. The people around us were confused,and kept telling her that we were on line. She let us stay, but before I went through customs she looked at my boarding pass, and told me again in Spanish that I cut the line.  There's no need for that kind of attitude and to make a scene.

2015-07-17,1,10,Miami Airport customer review,C M Lilley,"Never again. After a delayed American Airways flight we were concerned that our planned 6.5 hour transit time had reduced to 3 hours. The queues through passport control were very long, our baggage took an age to appear, baggage trolley cost an outrageous $5, then there was the astonishingly long line to get through customs control. Whenever we asked if, as transit passengers, we really needed to go through this channel we were shouted at to ""Get in Line"". Finding our way to the check in for our onward flight was confusing and extremely frustrating. Eventually, a very kindly security guard recognised our distress and directed us to our destination. By this time we were worried that we would miss our flight as we had passed the ""gate closed"" deadline. Thankfully we made it, just. As a couple well over 70, one of us having an obvious medical problem (broken shoulder) we would never transit Miami again.
