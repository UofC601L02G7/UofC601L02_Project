2023-10-06,1,10,"""has quite a problem with luggage cart rental""",Katherine Peck,"✅ Trip Verified | I am disappointed to say that I think Hobby, perhaps the whole Houston Airport system, has quite a problem with luggage cart rental. I was traveling on Monday 10/02/2023 evening with my daughter and grandson, from Denver to Houston. While on vacation my daughter injured herself and was wheelchair bound. When we arrived at Houston Hobby baggage claim where I needed to rent a cart to retrieve luggage and get her to the handicapped pick-up place while getting my 4 year old grandson to move along with us easily. I swiped my credit card and was unable to get the cart loose so I swiped again and got the cart. and was charged twice. I am now trying to get a refund on the second $7.00 charge and am unable to get through on the e-mail address they provide. Then I tried making a complaint. As I did so I marked complaint on the format they provided to contact them. It kept deleting my phone number so their system would not accept the complaint. I decided to check compliment where it promptly took my request for a refund. What has happened to the Houston Airport system? It should not be difficult to contact the right person for a mistake.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2023-08-14,3,10,"""favorite places to eat are no longer here""",D Harper,"✅ Trip Verified |  Travel to West Texas from South Texas to visit grandkids 2-3+ times a year. Seems like I always have 2-3 + hours to wait either way I am going. So, I am always looking for a relaxing place to sit. I have noticed on this trip that some of my favorite places to eat are no longer here. What a pity. The sit down food available at the present time is extremely poor, over priced & there is always a wait to be seated even seating for one. If you choose the fast food options, there are long lines & then no place to sit to eat. Why must the city of Houston rip travelers off by charging outrageous prices for food that is barely a step above fast food. Also, more of variety of food offered would be nice.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

Not to thrilled with the airlines, you're pretty much stuck with Southwest. Was looking forward to eating at Pappasitos but guess the city kicked them out. And the day of my departure most of the restaurants were closed. Not fun because I arrived 3 hours early. Even though I can expense my dinner I decided to just wait till I get to my destination. I'll fly into Houston twice more in the next two months and will continue to use IAH as there are many more options.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2019-10-12,5,10,"""does have some of the worst signage I've ever seen""",W James,"✅ Trip Verified | The airport is clean, nicely compact and easy to navigate, once on the property. It has clearly been renovated in the relatively recent past, and that is seen in how spacious the security area now is, and how modern the architecture now is. Check-in was quite easy and hassle-free. Security is quite time-consuming, tedious trudge if you don't have TSA Pre-Check, but if you do have Pre-Check, you're pretty much golden! There are several pretty nice stores and restaurants post-security, nothing fancy, nothing even particularly Texan, but satisfactory. However, I can't bring myself to particularly like this airport. Unless the much nastier-in-almost-every-way Bush airport across town, which has friendly personnel, the people that work at Hobby seem to have taken on a mission to be snarky and ""power-trippy"" toward passengers. From shuttle bus drivers to ticketing agents, from TSA personnel to store clerks, and from restaurant employees to gate agents, hardly anybody at Hobby seems to appreciate the fact that they actually work at a fairly beautiful, modern airport. If Bush employees can have a positive attitude, so, too, should Hobby employees, but maybe that's asking for too much! Furthermore, this airport does have some of the worst signage I've ever seen, at least approaching the airport and within the terminal pre-security; the quality of the signage is great, but the directions can be confusing. Also, the economy parking lot fills up easily and often, forcing unfortunate drivers to park in the parking garage adjacent to the terminal, which costs something like $24 USD daily. All in all, this airport has a lot of the aesthetic measures on point, but the management there seem to fail to remember that airports always serve as introductions to cities and regions. Are snarky and ""power-trippy"" personnel who they really want to represent Houston and Texas? I really want to like this airport, but I just can't! What a shame.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-11-15,3,10,"""security line always confusing""",R Robins,"Not Verified | The security check line is always confusing, you will be taken through a weird zigzag line, then end up in one line. Then an angry employee will yell at everyone “there are two lines”! So people move over, other customers get upset because there was no indication that there are two lines and they get cut in front of. Then, once you are in line to get searched, the employees yell something sarcastic or mean about changing lines, “don’t look at me funny, I only work here.” Then you will end up changing lines again for the actual security check. All the while, the employees treat you with anger, like it’s the customers fault that it is so unorganized. If the lines were more odvious, like all of the other airports in the US, the customers and employees would be much happier.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-10-31,9,10,"""everything was very smooth""",Anurag Dave,"Flew into Houston Hobby from Las Vegas, and then flew out from Hobby to San Diego. My experience at Houston Hobby was flawless. Be it baggage claim, check-in, or security screening, everything was very smooth. I didn't get a chance to try the restaurants, shopping, or wifi at this airport since my departing flight was very early morning, and I just wanted to nap in the boarding area. I would recommend this airport to anyone flying into the Houston area.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2013-08-18,6,10,Houston Hobby Airport customer review,M Estrella,If you come in late at night be aware that services are non-existent. Lucked out on rental car facility being open. During the day it's not bad. Only one TSA line and that looked like it had the potential for being long so arrived extra early for return flight and went through in less than five minutes. Easy to navigate and thanks to Southwest plenty of places to charge electronics. Concessions as expected. Bush Intercontinental should be this good.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-12-03,5,10,Houston Hobby Airport customer review,Steven Dratler,Houston-San Diego on Southwest terminal cramped at the check in desk then in the security area it is very open and there is plenty of shops and space but once you get into the concourse it is cramped again. Find a place to eat before security because after security there are very few places. The concourse is very small with few shops the seats very limited. Mostly a Southwest airport very little other choices. Overall a generic secondary airport with mainly Southwest as the only option.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-11-21,8,10,Houston Hobby Airport customer review,S Ratliff,Very easy airport to get out of and into. I normally fly into IAH but this time it was cheaper to get into Hobby. In reference to an International Terminal coming in yes it will happen here in the near future as the City has approved it to be built within the next two years. Pretty easy check in procedures and staff is real friendly and nice.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2009-09-20,4,10,Houston Hobby Airport customer review,S Koenig,"Houston's smaller in-town airport. Much closer to downtown than is the larger Houston Bush International (IAH) so you can save a lot on taxi or shuttle fare by arriving here. We arrived about 9 p.m. and the airport looked pretty much shut-down for the evening but facilities looked clean. Long wait for our bags. If you take a taxi you need to know to exit the terminal and make your way across a couple of small roads to the ""island"" where the taxis wait. If in doubt ask before you walk too far. We had to depart from IAH since it was an international flight but if I could choose I'd always use Hobby.",,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
