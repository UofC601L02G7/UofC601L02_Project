2022-06-30,6,10,"""airport feels slightly dated""",John Walker,"✅ Trip Verified | Portland's airport feels slightly dated, not run down by any means, but still pleasant and functional enough. A lot of construction taking place at this time in the check-in area, I guess in an effort to modernize the airport and expand passenger capacity. The terminals themselves, again, are a little dated, but still nice enough and functional. TSA Pre-Check operates smoothly here, even where there are a lot of Pre-Checkers in line. Personnel, whether they're working at check-in, for TSA, in a restaurant, or at the boarding gate, are usually super bubbly, but still professional, helpful and polite. PDX is neither stellar nor bad, it's above-average but with a lot of potential.

2020-02-19,2,10,"""should really get their act together""",D King,"Not Verified |  I used to think the PDX was an ok airport, and after tonight’s security fiasco, I am changing my tune. 10 people got through the security line in 30 mins. She said my neck pillow, which had grains in it, could be explosive. She swabbed it on the outside then took out the sealed insert and swabbed the inner layer. And said “people try and take explosives, it could be explosive” my response was. “It's a neck pillow” if those weren’t allowed to take on flights, then put a sign up! The arrogance of the TSA staff is ridiculous. 30 minutes to let through 10 people! The two families with small children in front of me are not security risks. They’re now super stressed out single moms! Because you took apart all of their children’s things and made them wait in a line for no reason. It felt just like they were being mean and literally searching through every persons bags. It was the worst security experience ever, and I’ve flown through JFK and it’s not like the other TSA agents were doing anything, at least 10 of them they were just standing around talking about their weekend. Flying can already be stressful, there’s no need for the drama over neck pillows. It was ridiculous. Portland International Airport should really get their act together and maybe use some more common sense in the hiring of their TSA agents.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

I have a steel hip and this has caused numerous delays in other airports but either they know me by now or they have their collective ish together.

Airport traffic was light with several empty spaces for cars to pull up to the curb. I had been there no more than 2-3 minutes when a military-looking airport security guard suddenly started pounding on my passenger window. ""Get out of here!"" I rolled down the window to tell him I had waited for notice my passenger was available and he leaned all the way into my car and shouted, ""If it was alright for you to be here, would I be talking to you?"" I pulled my head back so fast I smacked the driver's door. He was completely out of control and shouting as if a major emergency were happening. I sincerely thought he was going to hit me or continue striking my car. I saw my daughter out of the corner of my eye and was immediately afraid for her safety. I pulled away as fast as I could so he wouldn't realize she was connected to me. I'm 62 and a small woman. Portland International Airport doesn't deserve all the high ratings. This isn't the first time I've had their airport personnel act like they enjoy menacing people.

There are about 15 machines to verify your password and to answer customs questions which worked great, but then you get in a very slow moving queue with 2 customs officers to ask the same questions you just answered. Do the math 15 machines then down to two agents guess what happened ... we all got through the machines quickly just to get stuck in a slow moving line for the worthless additional step. Then you grab you luggage and yet another agent only one this time checks your customers and passport again.

Staff kept screaming something at me, I had no idea what, but I knew what was expected so ignored him and was just waiting my turn to go through the screener; he actually grabbed me by the shoulder and pulled me back! I am nearly 70 years old, female, I jerked away and he pulled me back and screamed at me to empty my pockets! I do not have things in my pockets, good grief.  Got to my boarding area, Southwest C12, and sat down to read and wait ... looked down and the metal bar between the seats was covered with filth. It was so thick you could run your fingers through it. So disgusting, I got up and looked for a clean seat, and they were all filthy, so I just got some exercise and walked for two hours.

",Susan Hill,Not Verified |  40 minutes to get through security. 25 in line and then the worst was the arrogant attitude of all TSA when my bag was pulled to be checked - it sat there for 5 minutes. 4 workers stood right there within 3 feet of it talking to each other. After 5 minutes another woman walked nearby and I went to her and said my bag has been there 5 minutes - she had an arrogant attitude as well and said with an annoyed tone - someone will get to it. I waited another 3 minutes - 2 of the 4 talking walked the other direction and 2 still talked a minute or more - I tried to get their attention but was ignored. I saw another man standing around and told him my bag had been there almost 10 minutes - same attitude - “someone will get to it”. With an attitude a minute later a still waiting - I saw a woman who I complained to and she said same thing with an attitude. Meanwhile a TSA man had gone to the next row over and started checking 2 or 3 bags that had come out way after mine - mine was only bag for a full five minutes at least. It took 15 minutes. Rude people that don't care and think they are god because they have so much power over your life and you can’t do anything about it.

At the D/E security check, my husband and I were told that our TSA passes on our phones 'could have been photo-shopped' so we'd need to proceed through security as usual - unpacking liquids, toiletries, digital devices, removing our shoes and jackets. This was super unusual and uncalled for. What is the point of paying for the additional service and being frequent travelers if there is no recognition of our ability to comply?

Yes he said hell because it surprised him and he is 22. Then the guy got all upset because he said hell and told me he cursed at him when he didn't. The guy wasn't even wearing a uniform or a badge! He was completely rude to me when I asked why he had to shove his stuff down! Even the people around us where talking about how rude he was to my son so I know it wasn't just us.

We got past the licence check and this little guy was yelling at people to ""Pick a line or I will pick one for you!!"" Everyone was moving fine there was an older lady who was a little slow because of her age and she looked so upset by what he said. Why do they feel they need to be so rude?!

I cannot find a better airport than Portland in terms of access, TSA service, parking, car rental, and restaurants. It is small enough to have that hometown feeling unlike LAX or SFO yet large enough that you will notice the long lines at peak periods. Yet, the TSA seems to be much more responsive and best of all, compassionate in this most painful point of travel. They seem to be able to open new lines, cross cover one another and be cheerful at the same time. Best of PDX is that the provide an area to accommodate families and fiends to greet incoming pax. All other airports just want you to drop off and get out. Here they have stores and restaurants outside of the security where we can meet and greet. I do not recall any other airport like this. Overall, just a smart, caring design that works for me.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2015-01-23,10,10,Portland Airport customer review,S Fenwick,I'm a big fan and frequent user of PDX. I can't comment on pax drop-off as I usually take the MAX from downtown- clean cheap easy to manage with roll-aboard luggage. TSA areas show a pre-2001 design with post-9/11 security added where it could be shoe-horned in. TSA Pre is usually quick as long as there aren't too many random selectees who need to be told to keep their shoes on coats on don't take out laptops etc. for some reason this seems worse here than at airports like SJC or SEA. Dining and shopping options are excellent for an airport this size and with this traffic. The airport is apparently changing out a number of mainstream concessionaires for local vendors including several food carts in the terminals. Prices are same in the airport as outside and quality is also generally consistent with outside vendors. The terminals are bright broad and high so there is a consistent feeling of openness. It's a very pleasant airport to be stuck in.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2014-09-28,5,10,Portland Airport customer review,M Atkinson,"There's a lot of bad and good to say about Portland International Airport. First the good: PDX has a lot of restaurants and shops to visit. Prices aren't too outrageous and it feels organized and easy to navigate. I've read a lot of complaints about the TSA in Portland but I've experienced very few problems especially compared to other airports. The lines usually move fast and they don't make me remove all my liquids from my luggage which some airports do. Now the bad: the pick up for PDX is a mess. It doesn't need to be but it really is. First of all is the smoking problem. Everywhere along the pick up line are signs that say ""No Smoking."" There is a designated smoking area at the very start of the line where cars come in. However whenever I'm at PDX there are smokers standing all over the place in any location along pick up. I have yet to see PDX enforce them. The second issue with pick up is that there are signs posted everywhere asking people to not wait. That's why there is a very useful easy to find cellphone waiting area nearby. However often the pick up lane will be entirely blocked with parked cars who are still waiting for people to get out of baggage claim or off their flights. I've watched multiple cars sit in the same spot for over fifteen minutes while the drivers played on their cell phones. On many occasions I've picked up and been picked up at this airport and if anything I've always seen cars blocking the entire pick up line with no one in sight to pick up. There was no one to enforce the many signs stating this was illegal. It's been a problem several times which is why I'm finally writing about it. Weekends are the worst and I usually try to avoid that but sometimes that's impossible. Let's use common sense PDX! I can understand giving people a few minutes so the person being picked up can run to the car from wherever they were waiting outside and drop their luggage in the trunk but anything over five minutes to fifteen plus minutes is ridiculous.",yes,"{'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-07-06,10,10,Portland Airport customer review,Marty Johnson,"I cannot say enough good things about PDX. The ticketing lobby is open and airy. The boarding gate concourses are well maintained with ample room to relax a bit. Food and shopping options offer typical products of the Pacific Northwest. My only complaint would be about the United Express and Alaska/Horizon regional boarding areas. They are crowded noisy and in the winter cold. I was so impressed this time with the professionalism of the customs immigration and agriculture inspectors. They were friendly personable and helpful. One feature I really liked was the presence of ""Ask Me"" persons who stand by at strategic places and can help with just about any question. International travelers may find the shuttle bus around to the main terminal from the customs area a bit trying. Here's hoping they can get that changed up soon. There are even musicians at times in each of the terminals playing pianos and guitars. Nice.

But thanks to a courtesy call from the airline/airport I could catch an earlier flight if I could get to the airport in one hour. It was slightly stressful but it was not at all difficult to drive ~4 miles from the city find long-term parking check-in go through security run to the gate and board the plane with carry-on.

2014-04-07,4,10,Portland Airport customer review,Jerry Wallace,I fly frequently through PDX sometimes several times per month depending upon where my current workplace is located. Pick-up and drop-off has never been a problem as long as one does so efficiently and if not then expect the traffic patrol to move you along. TSA is another matter. I am under medical orders to not use the scanner screens so must have pat-downs each flight. When I inform TSA that I cannot go through the scanner due to the medical conditions they are invariably rude and frequently leave me standing for several minutes. I work in an industry where I frequently test positive for certain chemical combinations which further puts the wind up in them even though I carry all the proper credentials and in all likelihood have had a more extensive background check to work in my industry than they do in theirs. I establish my credentials and usually have to demand a superior to handle the questioning and pat-down which makes the process longer but more civil. In short there is too much of the them-versus-us attitude from TSA. Other amenities are reasonable the toilet facilities are superior in cleanliness to most airports but the bars are irritating demanding identification-proof of age from those of us past 50 for a drink. Nonsense. In short PDX has both positives and negatives much like most airports access is good from the freeway the traffic jam is TSA.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2010-12-22,1,10,Portland Airport customer review,D Sharples,Worst experience picking up a passenger ever. I am partially handicapped and have the blue sticker with me in my car and I always try to pick up passengers in the handicapped zone at PDX (what a joke that turned out to be) since I move rather slowly esp. after having sat in the drivers seat for a while. Yesterday after being called from the cell-phone waiting area I went to meet my party at the handicapped loading zone right next to the Delta / Horizon zone put my handicap sticker in plain view in the front window and before I could even finish pulling over and popping open the trunk I was verbally assaulted by an unbelievably obnoxious meter maid demanding that I move on. She didn't even give me a chance to explain that I was picking up my passenger and immediately plunked herself in front of my car and began writing a $70 ticket! My passenger was loading her bags in the trunk and got in no more than 60 seconds later and couldn't understand why this woman was behaving so outrageously.

While it was nice to have the consolidated rental car facility near the terminal with no shuttle bus required finding the correct entrance was a bit confusing. As noted having a light rail station adjacent to the station is a definite plus (about 45 min to the area of downtown where we were staying) though we had so many bags we did not use it. Although I had read that taxis to downtown cost about $30 we were told at the airport they would cost about $45 and so used one of the shuttle vans costing about $14 per person (usable for downtown only). There are several hotels and shopping malls near the airport. I agree that the road immediately in front of the terminal is crowded and chaotic. Use caution when talking out to the center island for courtesy vans (eg. for hotels).,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2010-02-07,1,10,Portland Airport customer review,Ronald Sampson,Absolutely horrible! Do not try to drop somebody off at curbside. It's a cluster mess. The airport still uses a 1930s era design- essentially the dropoff for all airlines is in the same spot. Eeeeks! Worse because it just can't handle the volume of cars and passengers they have traffic cops running around handing out $70 parking tickets like candy. I travel alot- PDX is the worst with this in the entire country. Get out of the drivers door the meter maid is at the ready runs up stands in front of your car so you can't drive away and writes you a parking ticket. Shakedown!! When you try to explain you were just helping your passenger with their bags they'll rudely argue that you are parked and the signs say no parking. Unbelievable! Also don't take a cab from PDX airport downtown- the meter rates are breathtaking- you'll hit $12 before you even get off airport property (about 1/2 mile). Lastly take your food in through security- the gate areas are small under-developed and over crowded. What an absolute mess- Portland grow up!,,"{'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2009-07-23,5,10,Portland Airport customer review,C Brazier,I live in Portland and fly out of PDX a couple times a year. TSA have always been nice to me. They have never lost my bags which I cant say for many other places. I love all the food choices and easy to read signs.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-07-12,3,10,Portland Airport customer review,A Maier,I connected through PDX on my way from FRA to YVR. Overall as far as US airports go PDX is quite nice. There are big airy atriums in the security area which gives it a much more open feel that then the claustrophobic low ceilings of many US airports. PDX is quieter newer and nicer than SEA where I connected on my departure. However my BIG complaint with Portland Airport? No duty free at all! I was connecting from Germany to Canada and was counting on there being duty free in PDX and was surprised to find absolutely none.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-06-09,4,10,Portland Airport customer review,Chu Yeow,Love the free wifi and the Tri Met connecting the airport to downtown Portland (only for $2.05 too) but a pretty plain airport otherwise. The TSA staff were sometimes rude which isn't much to say since they are generally all work and low on courtesy everywhere in the US anyway.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-05-27,1,10,Portland Airport customer review,V Ayala,I live in Portland and I find the airport nice with many restaurants and shops. However I find the TSA to consistently be rude. On my last flight from Portland I had a broken knee and was unable to walk. I was stopped at security because my metal leg brace set off the metal detector and I was searched for 40 minutes. I was only able to catch my plane as I continued to plead with them that I was about to miss my plane and I was in no condition to run to the gate. I was the last person onboard and I lost my seat so I had to hold my broken knee in the middle seat for 5.5 hours. The Portland TSA simply chose to harrass me. I have had many experiences in this airport that have been fine but based on this experience when I was disabled I would only give this airport a one star rating.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-05-20,3,10,Portland Airport customer review,J Butler,"I would give PDX a five star rating if there weren't so many problems with the TSA staff here. I've flown in and out of PDX about a dozen times and PDX is easy to get in and out of easy to meet up with pre-arranged car service and the retail and restaurants are surprisingly diverse for an airport of its size. I travel a lot through many airports including all three NY airports and the PDX TSA staff is out of character for Oregon - aggressive poorly managed and obnoxious. My checked bag is opened by TSA virtually every time I've left from there my ID is scrutinized with loupes (it once took ten minutes for two TSA agents to find whatever they were looking for on my driver's license) and they are generally slow and procedure laden. I recently saw a TSA agent grab the lapel of a jacket worn by a Mexican woman who did not speak English and yell at her to take it off. I saw another TSA agent insist on taking away a walker from an elderly woman who obviously needed it to pass it through the X-ray machine. One TSA agent grabbed the laptop in my hands as I was putting it into a plastic bin for screening. I held onto it and he was incensed. He then had his friend at the X-ray machine single me out for a hand check of my bag. The original ""grabber"" then played out the hand check for a half hour in an attempt to make me miss my flight.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-03-14,5,10,Portland Airport customer review,D Brock,"PDX is my home airport. As with others excellent points are: manageable size and layout shopping (interesting shops and food no state sales tax and airport does a good job at enforcing ""same prices as in town"" policy) connection to MAX light-rail right at the terminal. In addition I'll add that they do lots of nice musical promotions throughout the year: live music at various places both inside and outside of security. International connections are growing: NW to NRT and soon to AMS LH to FRA; transcon flights increasing as well. Often-slow baggage delivery is my only complaint and yes having to take checked bags from check-in counter to CTX machine is minor irritant as well. Still small price to pay for an otherwise great operation!",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-11-19,5,10,Portland Airport customer review,T Porter,As a Southern Californian I consider PDX to be the Anti-LAX. Unlike LAX - PDX is clean bright modern efficient spacious and pleasant. The shopping and dining options in the mall connecting all concourses are among the most unique of US airports with lots of regional offerings instead of national chains. It's not a huge airport but rather a mid-sized airport for a mid-sized city. But just like Portland itself the airport is a gem. Did I mention how clean and sparkling PDX is? The modern MAX light rail line from the terminal into downtown and suburbs is a bonus and such a rarity in America. The only downside is that PDX is not the mega-hub that Seattle or San Fran is and so you sometimes have a hard time finding non-stop flights for transcon or overseas destinations. But overall PDX is one of America's most pleasant and manageable airports to spend time in.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-06-19,4,10,Portland Airport customer review,J Locicero,"De-boarding was quick and efficient. The terminal was airy and almost eerily empty - just one sleepy guard near the exit! On the way home Sun evening I took the light-rail MAX train to the airport from downtown Portland. It's about a half hour and goes through some interesting neighborhoods. This is a rarity for American airports and especially one as small as this but it very easy and only costs $1.50. Again the terminal was quiet and security was brisk. The selection of shops & restaurants was a bit underwhelming but I found everything I needed (magazine gourmet pizza oregon wine). I think calling this airport an ""architectural masterpiece"" is a bit of a stretch but all-in-all a well-designed and hassle-free airport. Can't wait to do it again!",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-06-13,5,10,Portland Airport customer review,Gregg Hillier,PDX is a great airport in most respects: the lines move quickly there are separate security lines for Seattle-shuttle and Elite Frequent Fliers there is a good choice of food and the vast expanse of glass and skylights are great. Considering that Delta abandoned their hub here in 2001 the Airport did'nt fall apart but instead recruited Lufthansa an NWA nonstop to Tokyo and Alaska Airlines continues to grow PDX into a small hub. Now the negatives: when checking bags you must get them tagged at the ticket counter and then lug them to a TSA checkpoint which is sometimes far away. Worse is the baggage claim - it takes an eternity for your bags to appear on the belt - no matter which airline your are flying.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
