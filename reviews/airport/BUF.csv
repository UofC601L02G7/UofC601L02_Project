What a rotten rule,is this the USA or not. Whoever made these rules is a complete fool. Insensitive elite losers. Many people use cash we don't want to be taken advantage of by these banks and institutions that hate people.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2023-10-29,10,10,"""so warm and thoughtful"" ",S Danes,"✅ Trip Verified |   Getting through this airport was such a breeze, our home airport is Pearson, which is insanely busy. We were able to apply for TSA cares for our autistic family, Tameeka helped us from start to finish of security and was so warm and thoughtful in helping us navigate their first time through! Highly recommend using this service if you have a family member with disabilities. We applied for the same program at Orlando and no one helped us, the staff were rude and the lady guarding the family and disabled line tried to turn us away. Thoroughly disappointed especially compared to Buffalo! We will definitely be flying out of Buffalo in the future!",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2023-08-19,1,10,"""by far the worst""",B Jones,✅ Trip Verified | I fly to a lot of airports through out the country Buffalo is by far the worst when it comes to ground crew present at arrival and time to baggage claim.

So if you don't have a credit card, you cannot buy any food or drink or anything else there (and of course, they take away your drinks at the security check!). This is a nightmare, especially for travellers who don't bring credit cards.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'January 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

The person in front of me cut me off, and the person behind me pulled up so tight to me that I couldn’t back up to get out and the parking person or security person who directs you out of the pickup area came over and was absolutely atrocious.

This is a chronically late bus service and security knew they weren't giving good info. It's not marked in the bus area. The whole situation is sketchy.

2015-09-30,6,10,"""a nice experience""",Tyler Patterson,The Buffalo Niagara Airport was quite an experience. It was easily accessible and was fantastic with the hotels right across the road. The staff were okay. We were flying early in the morning so they might have been tired but they seemed alright. The airport was larger than I expected. The parking was easy and cheap. Overall it was a nice experience.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2014-03-27,3,10,Buffalo Airport customer review,R Liria,I was trying to find a parking spot for more than 70 minutes in the only small enclosed parking and finally I left to park outside. Can't believe an airport with that traffic and weather don't have a covered parking area for people who would like to pay for it. Really bad service.,,"{'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2013-03-21,9,10,Buffalo Airport customer review,S Selvaraj,Excellent option travelling from Toronto Canada. Quick drive to apt check-in is a breeze as only single flight scheduled at desk smaller aircraft means smaller line-ups everywhere. Security was thorough but very quick - no rush no herding. Apt is spacious enough to handle the crowd. No walking endlessly. Collect baggage and walk out to the outside in a minute. The ride to the apt from Toronto is not at all bad allow 2.5 hrs travel time door to door from the middle of Toronto. Will always be my only choice for North American travel. Food options not much air-side.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2009-07-14,5,10,Buffalo Airport customer review,James Burke,K George is right on the money. As we were getting our things out of our car for our flight the Parking Shuttle guy patiently waited for us and helped more than most do. We flew out on Southwest and in on US Airways. Buffalo works well for SW as there is very little time wasted for taxiing so planes can get in and get out quickly. The airport is bright and easy to use. Be advised that the Jetway does not get lowered for regional jets so if its a rainy day and you are on a CRJ or ERJ to BUF have a newspaper handy to hold over your head!,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-12-20,5,10,Buffalo Airport customer review,K George,BUF is a great smallish airport to fly into and out of. Security moves quickly the lines are short and it's very convenient for pick-up/drop-off and rentals. Upon arrival you can literally be in your car with baggage within 20 mins. Parking is expansive and cheap and there are always friendly drivers ready to pick you up at your car or drive you to it after arrival. The airport itself is bright and inviting- very well designed. It is also large enough to have a pretty good selection of flights- there are about 30 or so gates and probably a dozen or so airlines. You can't always get a direct flight but the options are not bad at all. My only gripe is there are only a few restaurant choices but since BUF is rarely a changeover it's not somewhere you'll usually spend a lot of time anyway.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-09-01,3,10,Buffalo Airport customer review,Gary Marsh,Buf appears to be a nice little airport with friendly staff who are very efficient and treat customers with respect. The downside being airside shops and restaurants facilities are rather poor compared to other airports. The airport waiting areas are not too bad and gates quite near to each other. Quite a pleasant airport to fly into and out of.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-08-27,4,10,Buffalo Airport customer review,Nathan Gilbert,I live in the Niagara Region on the Ontario Canada side and grew up in the Buffalo area. At one time it was common for Americans to trek to Toronto in order to obtain the best selection of flights at reasonable prices. Buffalo used to have three ancient small terminal buildings very limited parking and a small cartel of airlines operating out of it. Since the new airport in Buffalo has been built the range of airline choice and scheduling has grown and prices have fallen. Toronto on the other hand with its growth and congestion has become increasingly more expensive and although the drive from here is barely more than an hour that's hypothetical because traffic is always so bad in TO then if that's not enough parking is a nightmare you have to walk great distances to get to and inside of the terminals and now regardless of where you want to fly to it's much more expensive even after taking exchanges into consideration. We can leave our home be at Buffalo- Niagara in less than 45 minutes parking is plentiful and cheap but because it's such a hassle-free trip it's never any problem to get someone to do a drop off. You can just get in and out of there fast. I do agree the security barriers were placed in the most awkward part of the airport severely limiting the access to more shops and restaurant choices. The baggage carrousel area is also a bit tight when a few flights arrive at once but again these are small problems compared to the ease and reasonable prices. And for domestic flights within the US when you live in Canada you can entirely avoid customs when arriving and just drive from the airport and do your declarations at whatever bridge and it's so much easier. It's nice to be in this area and have the choice of airports - to include Hamilton which is making travel within Canada easier for us in this region.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
