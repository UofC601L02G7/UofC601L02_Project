2023-07-26,3,10,"""Ridiculous long wait for bags""",Jeff Wood,"Not Verified |  Airport was nice, however very long walk from arrival gate to baggage claim. Ridiculous long wait for bags to arrive on carousel. We flew from Dallas to Cincinnati, the flight was a bit over two hours, it took nearly that long (just under two hours) for our bags to arrive in baggage claim. The person at the baggage desk was not able to provide any information about the status of the bags. We had trackers on them and could see they were sitting at a different terminal for well over 90 minutes after our arrival. Talking to other passengers and the Uber driver, apparently this is very common. We were told the airport is expanding operations, without upgrading infrastructure or adding staff to handle the extra traffic. If you have appointments shortly after you arrive plan on being late.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2023-07-06,1,10,"""It was very unorganized""",S Keane,"✅ Trip Verified |  At Arrival, it took an excessive amount of time for my luggage to arrive at the claim area. At departure, there was a minimal line (when we got there) at TSA being funnelled into 2 open lanes (2 out of 10!) . The open lane we were put into hardly moved, as all wheelchairs and ClearPass passengers were moved in ahead of the line, rather than having their own independent lane for scanning & baggage check. Then the luggage machine broke, and we stood there for 20 minutes, until one worker finally decided to more the line over to the next machine. It was very hot in this area and after waiting almost 90 minutes to get through I felt nauseous. It was very unorganized and of all the airports I have flown through, never have I had these issues.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

They claimed it was due to construction but I had seen 3 fast pass busses before I had seen 1 valupark bus. Then when I inquired upon if they had any extra busses with a airport employee.

I first ran into her while leaving the Thrifty Car rental shuttle & entering the hallway to the ticketing/check in area & she saw that I was crying....she kindly stopped & asked if I was okay...her kindness made my cry more but in a wonderful way, if that could make any sense at all but very true. This sweet girl took my bags & insisted she carry & drag them for me to the check-in, asking if she could do anything to make things better for me or help me in any way, she would. I opened up & she listened, still pulling my luggage & carrying another bag of mine. Who does this?? A super person like her, that's who. Karen went above & beyond in her representation of Cincinnati Airport & I'm hoping whom ever reads this will go the extra mile, as Karen did & find her last name & get this to her manager. It's stories like this that we need to report & in my opinion, as important as a complaint. Please help this get to the correct department so credit is given to this very special employee.

I am recovering from stage 4 throat cancer and brought my 92 year old mother here for a flight to Phoenix, while taking her in and the car sitting with the handicapped sticker in the windshield, yep they ticketed it after being told by airport personnel to leave it and get her inside it would be ok.

My airport experiences are typically normal, with few issues, with the exception of the departure traffic attendants. They are extremely rude and unprofessional.

The signage is not adequate for those unfamiliar with the airport traffic patterns. The worst violation is the sign at the cell phone exit into the airport. The road consists of four lanes, two for arrivals or departures, the other two for commercial vehicles and exiting the airport. The sign for this pattern is overhead at the exit from the cell phone lot so you just have to guess and take your chances. Navigating out and back is sketchy.

The only problem I have had is with the employees that work in the Starbucks near concourse B. They treat their customers with the upmost disrespect, and the store is always filthy. These people chose to work at an airport Starbucks, and get paid to be there but act like every customer is a burden.

My satisfaction has been slowly declining over the past year. Two things that stand out during this trip are: 1) The line for pre-check was reconfigured recently to make passengers take an unnecessarily long walk in a circle to get to TSA. When multiple passengers did the logical thing and just ducked under the rope, they were scolded by TSA and the TSA agent said ""We wish they would reconfigure it too, but you can't duck under"". It should not be that hard for airport staff to occasionally check and reconfigure the line to accommodate the current volume of passengers. 2) The only quality food option in concourse B has been Outback, but their quality of service has been declining over the past year as well.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2017-04-03,5,10,"""a pleasant experience""",N Dunning,"✅ Verified Review |  Overall, Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky airport provides a pleasant experience and departing is not an issue. However, I have arrived at this airport twice in the past three weeks and an extremely aggravating problem has developed. Once you arrive at baggage claim, wait times to receive your checked luggage are ridiculously long. Today, I only had to wait 45 minutes and felt lucky because 3 weeks ago I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to get my bag. In both cases luggage from a dozen or so flights were being delivered to a single carousel around which several hundred very annoyed passengers were milling. There were typically gaps of 5 to over 10 minutes between arrival of new ""flights"" of luggage. I am not sure if this is a staffing problem, incompetence, or negligence, but if this trend continues I would recommend flying in and out of Dayton.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-06-15,8,10,"""airport is extremely clean""",Kevin Cuello,"One of the best airports in the U.S. CVG is an extremely efficient airport with great people, easy to use signs and walkways, and decent food options 1) Check in and Security - It's recommended to arrive no less than 90 minutes before your flight departs. Although it's nowhere as busy as it used to be, sometimes the lines at check-in tend to go longer than most other airports. Going through security here is very fast and efficient. 2) Walkways and trains - The walkways, escalators, and trains are clearly marked and very easy to navigate. It is very hard to get lost in CVG. 3) Concourse A - Concourse A has plenty of space and an abundance of seating. Plugins to charge are easy to find and the seats are comfortable. Restaurant options are varied and you can fond some really good food at good prices. The souvenir options are a bit lacking and are recommended that you purchase before you go to the airport. 4) Cleanliness and restrooms - The airport is extremely clean and has plentiful restrooms which are also clean.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

The worst part is that the airport staff didn't seem to care that we were still there and closed everything down. This isn't fair to stranded travelers. At least keep a bar open for us to congregate. Also, a paid smoking lounge? That's really cheap. Give me a break.

United baggage is the worst here leaving baggage unattended and office unmanned with serious delays. Carpeted floors make it difficult to push pull or drag bags. Train has extremely long waits and bathrooms do not have hooks in stalls to keep purses off the floor.

2013-04-16,10,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,Jim Porter,I flew on Delta Airlines to MCO and it was a great airport.

2011-12-13,8,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,J Quinterno,I recently transferred through CVG for the first time in several years. I had forgotten just how easy it is to make connections at this airport especially on Delta flights. The terminal is spacious clean and very well- organized. And the Delta SkyClub is very nice - nicer than many of the clubs at ATL. Unfortunately the service reductions at the airport show as it was extremely empty with relatively few flights showing on the boards.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2009-12-09,4,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,K Van Houw,Terminal 2 is not closed. It looks a bit dated (like it was built in the 70s well it was) but is efficient in serving its purpose. Overall a very easy airport to connect through everything is set up logically. For originating and departing traffic you can get between parking and your gate quickly even at peak departure times. TSA does a much better job here than I've seen at other airports. It's a shame Delta is in the long slow process of de- hubbing it in favor of ATL and DTW but that was inevitable post Northwest merger considering the simple geography of CVG being between the two.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-11-30,4,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,M Baughman,CVG has been decimated by the Delta/Northwest merger. Delta has mostly moved out and the airport seems abandoned - much like Pittsburgh. It's a shame to watch this airport build up from nothing return to its modest origins. Delta's Chitauqua Airlines regional jets are now pulling up to Terminal A gates while Delta tries to put ComAir (in dreadful remote Terminal C) out of business. Terminal 2 (Star Alliance) closed altogether and I would not be surprised to see Terminal A mothballed.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-03-17,4,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,J Schmidt,CVG is an easy airport if you're not flying Delta. If you are it's still not too bad. Terminal 2 restaurants are not too bad and there is now some food inside security. A big plus. Security at this airport is usually friendly and courteous but I've had my bags screened much pickier at CVG than any other U.S. airport to the point of almost missing a flight for the same bag and contents that caused no problems at other airports. It almost seems like security personnel are bored from few flights and really like to make up for it with those that are going out. Anticipate a little extra time for CVG security. Arriving and departing at Delta terminal 3 is more like getting into any other big airport but terminal 3 food and shops are far more extensive. It's more like a small Atlanta airport but the smaller size makes it less hassle. Arriving at terminal 2 is easy; as there are fewer flights. Unfortunately flights to and from CVG tend to be very overpriced since DL has a near monopoly.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-03-11,5,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,B Luchow,Cincinnati airport is the most wonderful airport I have connected through. The airport's A and B concourses reminded me of ATL but much wider and easier to navigate. Someone told me concourse C is closed but I went there as I had a 5 hour layover and there were several flights. This is a very nice city with a beautiful airport!,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-02-09,4,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,J Ludewig,Not sure whether they changed the attitude but the custom office at my last immigration process in January was very friendly and even joked about the extended security installations aka handprint etc. I was thru in less than 5 minutes. A very good airport to enter the US. Little strange however is the extended security check right after leaving the customs area when you need to go to your gate for the next leg of the trip. The security there is a lost more restrictive than anywhere in the US not to mention Frankfurt.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-12-04,4,10,Cincinnati Airport customer review,Douglas Weir,Immigration and Customs were efficient and I was through both of these plus the secondary security screen in less than an hour in spite of being nowhere near the front of the plane and with another international flight deplaning at the same time. The immigration staff did all that they could to reduce delays by checking forms in the line and correcting them rather than making people go to the back of the line and fill the forms in again and directing people to the US citizen desks once these were empty. This is more than can be said at many east coast airports. The 5 1/2 hour layover passed relatively quickly as the airport had a good variety of shops and the restaurant meals I purchased were surprisingly good when compared to my usual experiences. I'll keep this airport on my shortlist as a transit point.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
