From check in, thru security and the passenger boarding area. Security helped my wife greatly because of back surgery, she said they were wonderful.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2021-06-07,1,10,"""one of the most inefficient and unfriendly airports""",Lisa DePaulo,"âœ… Trip Verified | I am 40,000 miles short of a million miler. This might be one of the most inefficient and unfriendly airports I have ever entered! The only word I can think of is line! Two words slow lines. Do not be fooled of a small airport running smoothly. I had a 6.00am flight that I arrived at 4.30 and just got to my seat at 5.45! An hour and fifteen minutes for what two small planes? Maybe they should serve coffee at the airport. Slow and grumpy is all you get at this airport!",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2021', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-02-25,5,10,"""TSA notoriously overwrought""
",S Davies,Not Verified |  The TSA crew at this airport are notoriously overwrought. I was a TSA precheck customer with a carry on bag. It contained a sewing machine which had to be nitrite screened. These folks for all the years I've been traveling there to visit my daughter make the most of their authority. It's become a source of jest as it appears they need to justify their existence by overdoing the job to the point of inconsequential increments. Where is the common sense? The rest of the airport is a nice place. The remodel is excellent. The airline crews are friendly and helpful. Could we please calm down the TSA crew!,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'February 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-11-16,8,10,"""layout is a significant improvement""",L de Veyra,"PSC airport is currently undergoing remodeling and expansion which are due for completion in early 2017. With what is completed thus far, the layout is a significant improvement from the old outdated one. The look and feel of the airport is definitely more modern in keeping with the times. Being a relatively small airport, going through TSA is fairly quick. At this time, the restaurant options are not great but I expect them to improve upon completion. I hope the airport is able to lure more flights and more airlines in the future. Compared to the two relatively nearby airports (YKM and ALW), this is the nicest and largest of the three.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-10-11,7,10,"""gate area reasonably spacious""",Paul Harvey,"Pasco / Kennewick in Washington State is a small efficient airport currently under rebuild. On arrival my bags were delivered quickly and it was a short but slightly circuitous route to landslide (longer because of rebuilding work). On departure check-in was quick, TSA was both quick and helpful and the gate area reasonably spacious. There is a cafe in the gate area and the walk to the plane is very short. The one downside of the gate area is that there is loud musak playing over the tannoy (presumably to entertain us) at the same time as the gate announcements - hence you have no idea what the gate announcement is saying. Car parking is free for the first 30 minutes. The free wifi was too slow for use, there is a premium version for a fee.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
