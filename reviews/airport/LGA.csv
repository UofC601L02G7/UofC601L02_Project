Some people just skipped the line and went directly outside where they queued with the passengers who had waited for one hour while the other stranded people were inside still waiting. People in wheelchairs were set aside and automatically skipped the line. My wait for a trickling taxi was one hour. When I finally went outside to the next queue the waiting travelers inside had at least a 2 hour wait. The line inside the airport extended way outside the rope lines. People with children or pets were literally in deep trouble. The taxi cabs are not allowed to pick up passengers at the airport curb but are obliged to wait in a parking lot two miles from the airport and then fight traffic to get to curb and pick up a traveler. They make this long circle around the airport. There are hundreds of taxi cabs waiting in the lot. Causing hundreds of stranded travelers waiting for hours inside the airport. I would like to know the genius who created this mess so I could tell him/her what a dumb way to manage the taxi/passenger situation. With all the taxi cabs waiting in the parking lot causing the passengers to wait for hours in the airport instead of a quick turn over like in any other civilized country. It’s a disgrace and mismanagement of available taxis, time, airport disruption due to interminable lines and disgruntled passengers and extra fuel since the driver needs to travel fighting traffic to reach the terminal AGAIN. Besides that, think of the extra burden on the environment and the air we breathe, circling around like that for no reason whatsoever.

Another ten minutes later we were finally got on the shuttle, which took another ten plus minutes to get to our gate.

It took over an hour of us walking around, asking every Delta employee to eventually know where we were to go. The food options were pathetic: almost every stand had the same pre-made sandwiches sitting around for purchase. But the worst of all was the hot serve-your-self options that were placed under heating lamps in the middle of walkways. Passing travelers were free to touch and stir the food trays, but most did not even buy! All I could think about was the massive amount of global germs that would be deposited in each dish! To make matters even more depressing was the pan handle-like atmosphere where airport employees were harassing travelers to sign up for American Express credit cards. Some became indignant when we refused due to time restraints. One told me, “Ahh, come on, you got time, your plane isn’t leaving until 2.00!” Sadly, however, he or no one else, would help us locate our gate. My husband and I had to be detectives and do our own footwork to locate our plane’s eventual arrival gate. Finally, the “icing on the cake” would be the rock-hard stale doughnuts I purchased out of desperation after throwing away my pricey, cold, bland ham and cheese sandwich encased in a soggy roll, layered with smooshed tomatoes and wilted lettuce!

Employees never gave a clear explanation, and the employee she had initially spoken to just walked off without communicating the opt-out to her co-workers. Any time I questioned staff, they were confrontational and hostile towards me. When my wife finally got a pat down the employee verbally demeaned her, chastised her for not following directions, even though directions were not given.

2019-06-06,1,10,"""inconvenience and mismanagement""",G George,"✅ Trip Verified | My experience at La Guardia was beyond the most horrific I have ever experienced in an impoverished third world country. I have been through airport construction projects in numerous airports and none remotely approached the inconvenience and mismanagement at La Guardia. None, nowhere. Communication was nonexistent or worse, incomprehensible. I will select a few examples from this nightmare just to illustrate. We landed hours late because of weather (to be fair, no fault of the airport). It was almost midnight. We followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs, followed the taxi signs until, finally, at the end of the terminal, far from the usual curbside, we at last found the taxi stand. Or so we thought. The long line waiting for taxi was actually not waiting for taxis at all, but for the bus, to take us to the taxis. Taxis were not allowed at the terminal. So we waited in torrential rain for the bus, which eventually took us to another place where we waited in the rain for a taxi. For our return, I had rented a car and had to drop it off. Unlike any other airport, there were no signs directing you to the rental car return. Fortunately or so I thought I knew my way around. I headed through a maze of construction to the place car dropoffs had been for decades . All but 2 had to move because of the construction. There were no signs or any communications informing you where to go. I asked a police officer, who kindly sent me in the wrong direction. GPS didn’t work. Finally, we found the virtually unmarked dropoff. I asked why there were no signs anywhere directing people to the new dropoffs. He responded, incredibly, that “we are not allowed to have signs off the airport”. We waited for the shuttle bus only to find out that the shuttle bus had to take us to another shuttle bus. During construction, car rental companies, who could not have signs off the airport, were not allowed to have shuttles on the airport. I know construction creates inconvenience, but the experience was a horrific nightmare not an inconvenience and I place full 100% blame on management, customer disregard, and complete incompetence in planning.

Just about then the tears starting coming, thinking I couldn’t board my plane and get home. Home sounded pretty darn good about now. All of a sudden the New York hero swoops in holding an I-phone, that suspiciously looks like mine, and proclaims “someone found an I-phone”. I took the phone, uttered a million thank yous. That didn’t seem quite enough and I hugged Mr Hero. Still overcome with gratitude, I threw my hands up in the air and shouted “ I love New Yorkers”.

I literally missed a connection because of the inefficiency of having to go from one terminal, to the other, and I had 45min to do so. Also gates are often switched at the last minute due to staffing and scheduling issues which forces you onto the archaic shuttle system between terminals.

However, this airport, given that it serves the needs of New Yorkers travelling to points east of the Mississippi, and Canada, is extremely convenient. A short taxi ride brings you to the airport. The distance from the entrance to the gates is very, very short. Thus, you save a lot of time. From being dropped off at the entrance gate of the terminal to the TSA check area, it is less than a one minute walk - if you have your boarding pass with you. The gates are immediately thereafter. I am sure once the new terminals are constructed, the walks will be long and I will have to trudge long distances to my gate. I used Terminal B for a United flight from Gate C9. C9 is at the end of the terminal pier. So this is a very convenient, straight forward, quick terminal to use. In less than 5 minutes, including TSA inspection I was at my gate! I did not check any bags. Ample seating and quite a few electric connections to charge your phones all around. At this end, with the large glass windows, not only is the waiting areas bright, thanks to natural light streaming in, you can see flights landing and taking off. I was given TSA pre-check and going through the security inspection was a quick walk in the park. I did not have to pull out my laptop or liquids or even shed my coat or remove my footwear; I had put the phone in my bag. Food stalls after TSA are few but basic snacks and sandwiches are available. A little bit of research before coming to the airport can help travelers prepare for the services available and thus manage expectations. While the airport currently handles more traffic and passengers than it was built for, this is the airport where you can be at your gate from arriving at the terminal in just a few short minutes.

Their Spirit flight from Chicago is arriving at least one hour late. I am told the only place to wait for arriving passengers is near baggage claim. There is a woman there, apparently doing nothing, in a kind of uniform wearing a badge reading something like ""passenger assistant"". I ask her where to find an arrivals monitor. She laughs and says: ""there are no such monitors here"". I ask where to find them elsewhere, she says ""there are only departures monitors"". I express my surprise, she keeps laughing and she says ""this is how this airport is right now"". Then I ask her to please find information about Spirit 630, she laughs again and says ""it's impossible"". Then I wander about the airport, finally spotting, on the floor above, an arrivals monitor. The arrival appears to be imminent, so I go downstairs not to miss my daughter. Of course I still don't know whether the plane has landed.

Another bus radioed the correct bus and no answer. He was nice enough to bring us close to our terminal since we waited over 40 minutes. If this driver didn't help us we probably would have missed our flight. Upon our return the same senerio happened- no directions and every employee we asked hadn't a clue. We waited 40 minutes and the driver stops and talked to everyone he knows bringing the trip to retrieve our car close to a hour and 10 min. The airport should institute and educate directions to their employees and have signs for where to go. Airport staff as far as TSA, American Airlines staff and the Hudson news staff were excellent.

They herded us onto the plane and we got seated and we were all smiles when the plane left the gate on time. But that is when things got bad. We spent just under an hour waiting on line to take off.

The best I could do was a flight to La Guardia, arriving Monday night Jan 24 at around 10pm. Apparently I was not the only person in that situation. Apparently the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that manages the airports in NY were not prepared. So many people arrived at around the same time, many of whom really wanted to get to Newark Airport, all of whom were being picked up by friends, family, taxis or car services, that the traffic in and around the airport was so bad that the good folks at the Port Authority were overwhelmed. Their solution was to shut down every access road into the airport. Bad idea. There were literally thousands of people waiting for cars that never arrived. My driver called me asking if I can meet him in the neighborhood on the other side of the highway. Not possible with the snow, no sidewalks, a suitcase. There were no alternatives. NYC public buses that service the airport were completely full by the time they arrived at my location. The line for the first bus stop on the airport property was ridiculously long. There is no subway or other train service nearby. Thousands of us were stranded. After about an hour waiting for my car service driver to make it on the airport property he called me to meet him at the Departure level, which was empty of people and cars. Almost any other way of dealing with this would have been better than how La Guardia Airport management dealt with it. The best way would have been to utilize both departure and arrival levels for passenger pick up, splitting the traffic load to several locations, actively direct and manage vehicle flow to minimize pick up time and maximize capacity. Not to completely shut access to the airport, stranding thousands of people and creating gridlock outside the airport.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
