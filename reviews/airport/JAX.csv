2023-10-28,10,10,"""Alejandro is hands down the best""",Judith Allen,"Not Verified |  While I found the Jacksonville airport to be very clean with exceptionally friendly, professional employees, my review is regarding one in particular. His name is Alejandro, a wheelchair provider for people departing and arriving at the airport. I first met him on October 17, 2023 when I arrived at JAX. He was prompt, friendly, and a very nice person. Well, when I left JAX I ran into Alejandro again and he recognized me (after a week and all the people he'd met). He was so pleasant. I have required wheelchair assistance when traveling for over 7 years and Alejandro is hands down the best.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2023-09-05,1,10,"""the most inefficient TSA security checkpoint""",Matthew Weaver,"Not Verified |  The gate agents are great, but they might have the most inefficient TSA security checkpoint I’ve ever witnessed. It took them around 30 minutes to scan 15 bags and only one was flagged out of the 15. They seem to be the only airport where the analogic machines have actually made the security checkpoint slower, which is wild considering the technology of those things. Everywhere else seems to have competent people to run them.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'September 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2023-08-20,3,10,"""What a discombobulated mess""",K Lea,Not Verified |  What a discombobulated mess! I bought TSA pre check to expedite airport security but what I witnessed today was a nightmare. Their new TSA pre check area and process for screening is atrocious. The plastic bins don't go in the same order as the prior who pass through - the person in front of me received his second container after I had received my first and the person after me had a container come through before mine as well. It creates longer wait times and more people standing around waiting for the bins. Lots of confusion causing additional travel stress.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2023', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"

2022-06-09,3,10,"""basic customer service has gone out the window""",Heather Lenhart,"Not Verified |  I was checking in my 15 yr old daughter for her flight to Chicago, to visit her father for the summer. She travels as an unaccompanied minor but we still like to walk her to her gate, sit with her while she waits and say our goodbyes before she gets on her flight. I have had minor issues with doing this with other airlines, due to security concerns/COVID/9-11 but this most recent visit, I feel I have to say something about the customer service. We get to the airport 1.5 hours before her flight. It's me, my daughter and her half sister. The ticketing agent was not pleasant from the word go. No greeting, no ""hi, how are you"", just a very bland ""how can I help you"". She asked me for ID and I said ""mine or my daughter's"" - as my 15 year old doesn't have an ID as she doesn't drive yet nor does she have a job. She got a bit of an attitude and was like ""hers"" meaning my daughter. I stated she did not have one for said reasons above. She proceeds to check my daughter in and as that is going on, I tell the ticketing agent that me and her half sister will need passes to walk her to the gate. She finishes with my daughter, then asks for my ID. I give it to her, she checks me in and gives me a gate pass and sends me on my way. I tell her I need a gate pass for her 17 year old half sister. She asks for her ID and when we told her it was in the car and we weren't sure she needed it, she was like ""of course she needs it, if she wants a gate pass, she needs to have an ID"". Me, not traveling much, didn't know the rules so I had both girls run out to the car (which was not close), get the ID and run back. My daughter was very distraught at this point and we are getting close to her departure time. I calmed her down, we go back to the ticketing agent where a man took over getting her the gate pass and we were on our way. We then get to the TSA line and it was a disaster. The line was miles long and travelers were stressing about missing flights. The line moved S-L-O-W. We had less than 30 min to get through TSA and to her gate. A lady in front of us asked a TSA employee about the line and what could be done to move it along faster and the TSA employee stated ""Lady, a lot of people are going to miss flights today"". I know airports are crazy and it was the start of summer but basic customer service has gone out the window. Almost every airport employee we encountered was rude.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2019-07-10,2,10,"""Poorly run with no concern for passengers""",Jordyn Stoddard,Not Verified |  Waited 1 hour in line to be checked by TSA. Unacceptable. Poorly run with no concern for passengers. Attitude of staff. For such a small terminal there should be a more efficient way to expedite passengers through and still provide the required safety needed. At least 15 passengers did not make their flight on this one airline due to the inefficiency of TSA. These passengers arrived an hour or more before flight. Totally disappointed.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'May 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-06-11,10,10,"""Very good experience""",Carole Roy,"❎ Not Verified | On June 7, 2018, I was departing from Jacksonville airport on American Airlines to Philadelphia, flight 4705. At Gate C8, an employee who was very supportive and accommodating to me. She was extremely busy; however, took the time to be sure I had a wheelchair waiting in Philadelphia. She also arranged to have me boarded early with someone. She offered to check my carryon bag as I was having difficulty. This woman is a credit to American Airlines. The plane was extremely cold the flight attendant gave me a blanket which I did not know were available. Very good experience.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2019-06-10,5,10,"""Who talks like that to people?""",Katarzyna Pomianowski,"Not Verified |  Unfortunately security staff at airport security check point was very rude, it was a male security officer. I placed my belongings in tray at check in point than on rolling rack and attempted to walk away. He came yelling - “whose stuff if is? Who is watching your stuff? You like you staff than stay there”! He sounded and behaved literally like an abusive spouse. What is this? Boot camp? Who talks like that to people? Most people coming to airport are stressed out already, and last thing anyone needs is a stranger coming out of nowhere yelling at them when only simple redirection is needed. What about being calm and professional instead? Otherwise airport was clean and easy to use, also rest of employees we encountered were very polite. Just this one individual gave airport bad rep for a day.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2016-10-27,9,10,"""great airport, I recommend it""",Dutch Heavener,"I go to Jacksonville airport a lot since this is my hometown airport. It is a nice, clean, and small with only 20 gates. Due to the size you don't really need signage at all. Despite the small size there is still a bunch of food options before and after the security checkpoint. There is also some good shops like Brooks Brothers and a PGA Tour Shop. There is also a big pavilion with rocking chairs right before security. It's a great place to wait if you're waiting on an arriving flight. There is also pretty good employees, well besides the TSA people. One time I had to go through the regular checkpoint instead of Pre-Check and they only had one metal detector and one ProVision open. It took about 25-30 minutes to pass through, because of this I got to my gate when they were calling the last boarding zone when I was supposed to board in the first boarding zone. However, a great airport and I recommend it.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-04-21,10,10,"""clean and efficient""",V Mogollon,"This airport is probably one of the best I have been to. Every employee I encountered was friendly and eager to help. The airport itself was clean and efficient. I flew in and out of this airport at busy times of the week and did not experience any problems. When I landed I went through baggage claim quickly and was waiting for my friend in a matter of 10 minutes. When I was flying out I had the same experience. I said goodbye to my friend and five minutes later I was at the gate. What a pleasure compared to flying out of Orlando, and there is free wifi.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-11-16,10,10,"""airport was clean and efficient""",Michael Liebmann,"I'd never been to Jacksonville Airport before. What I found when arriving is that it was a short walk to the street (maybe 10 minutes). I usually give myself 2 hours to go through ticketing and security in order to be on time for a domestic flight. This time, even with a bit of a line at security, I could have arrived about 90 minutes before the flight and still accomplished all I needed to do. The airport was clean and efficient. It's also small.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2012-08-28,10,10,Jacksonville Airport customer review,C Miro,Arrived on Southwest yesterday from Fort Lauderdale. JAX is modern.

2011-08-14,5,10,Jacksonville Airport customer review,Mark Robinson,It is clean staff are friendly and TSA is a breeze. Plenty of food and drink options. It is a smaller airport and is very well laid out. I usually fly one of the larger airlines and connect to its hub. The fares for doing this are usually much cheaper with JAX.,,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2011-07-05,5,10,Jacksonville Airport customer review,R O'Connor,Airport is Great. Security is very fast and I love the decor. The bathrooms were really clean.

2009-01-13,4,10,Jacksonville Airport customer review,Steve Koenig,Have only arrived here since we departed from another area airport (Orlando). Wish we had also departed from Jacksonville since it is so much smaller and quieter than Orlando. Picking up and returning rental cars seems quite easy as mentioned in other reviews. There are a couple of hotels on the airport grounds and others fairly close in case you have a late arrival or early departure. We arrived about midnight and the airport was pretty much closed in terms of restaurants and shops but that is common in most airports of this size and there were still a few personnel around to answer questions. Managed to find the phone to call our hotel for free shuttle pick-up. When visiting the area in the future I would definitely look into using Jacksonville or perhaps Daytona in lieu or Orlando.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-08-06,4,10,Jacksonville Airport customer review,D Valentine,Have used Jacksonville Airport on numerous occasions and enjoy this airport. I recently took a flight to DCA on 8-10-06 which was the first flight day after the terrorist incident in England. Security was noticeably increased however it was smooth as silk. Of course I did not bring onboard items that the news media had been talking about all day long as not being allowed but the security section of this airport is very very efficient. The TSA agents noticeably increased never once were unfriendly in fact it seemed that they were going out of their way to try and make a hard situation pleasant. This is a great airport and recommend using it whenever possible.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
