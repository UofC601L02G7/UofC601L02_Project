2022-10-22,4,10,"""Do not arrive too early""",David Taylor,✅ Trip Verified |  Do not arrive too early. We arrived 3 hours before-my friend was flying on a slightly earlier flight and I was told to wait outside as my flight was slightly later. No preliminary information.so had to wait an hour. Finally allowed inside the building where there were 5 security checks - really strange as the checks involved the same things. After all that my friends plane was still on the tarmac as we took off. Airport was clean and seemed well organised once inside but being kept outside was risky.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-06-18,3,10,"""staff members who are rude""",H Nalass,"Staff is very unprofessional and rude, food and drinks quality is awful, being checked and having my baggage checked for 3 times which is obviously not necessary if they think they’re doing their job right from the first time, staff in cafes in the seating area always trying to be funny and ending up to be rude, baggage helpers bugging and following me to force me to ask for their help and have to pay them money. Guiding to gates is very inefficient and need to ask staff members who are rude.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2019-05-24,8,10,"""reasonably efficient and courteous""",R Davidson,"✅ Trip Verified | New and pleasant airport terminal. Quite spacious. Free Wi-Fi. Security was reasonably efficient and courteous. Limited food and beverage service. Quick baggage retrieval. Extremely clean toilets. Very close to city, hotels and restaurants. I would highly recommend Alexandria International (AEX) when traveling to Central or Northern Louisiana.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
