2019-10-12,7,10,"""It was just a bazaar experience""",W James,"âœ… Trip Verified | Bluegrass is an amazing airport that I have flown into and out of numerously with nothing but positive experiences, until this July, 2019. To start, I'll tell what all I like about Bluegrass. Firstly, pickup, drop-off, and parking are almost a joke, they're so easy! Absolutely no hassle, ever. Secondly, the terminal was fairly modern to begin with even before the remodel about a decade ago, and now it's a ""well-flowing,"" well-organized airport (as if it already wasn't). Thirdly, while there are very few shopping and dining options, and they're really only open during peak traffic volume hours, this is to be expected for such a tiny airport, what options are available are of pretty high quality, plus Dunkin' Donuts (at least last time I checked). Fourthly, baggage claim is efficient even by tiny airport standards. (That said, if nothing is open pre-security, there's a piddly little coffee and hot chocolate machine that doesn't seem to work and when it does, it doesn't seem to work right.) Fifth, personnel from airport check-ins to security, to gate agents to store staff, are usually very friendly, attentive and kind, it's like Bluegrass is a sort of big small town. Sadly, however, when I flew out in July, there was an exception to that friendliness. When I flew out, the TSA Pre-Check line was closed, so I had no choice to go through the regular TSA line. Okay, fine, but the guy who checked my driver's license barely even moved his eyes. The officers at the scanner were more pleasant, but still made me take almost everything out of my backpack, thankfully, I didn't have much to take out, but I don't remember having to empty out so many little details from my bag while flying anywhere around the country or world. It was just a bazaar experience. Thankfully, security are still efficient and the gates are only a 2-3 minute walk from security, so I still made my flight in the nick of time, but that particular experience was just aggravating. Overall, Bluegrass is a fine airport that sets the gold standard for what tiny but very functional airports should be, but I sure wish all of its TSA folks understood the concept of Pre-Check.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'July 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-08-18,10,10,"""model of what a small airport should be""",Sean Kehoe,"This airport is great. Always clean, lovely staff, few delays, and good food. The information desk woman was very welcoming, and we had a lovely chat. Wi-fi access was good. As small airports go, Bluegrass is pretty much the model of what a small airport should be. Shopping options are limited, but you have a nice bookshop and a good bar after security, the car park is a minute's walk from the terminal, and the surroundings are well kept. In years of traveling through Lexington, I can think of nothing negative to say about this airport and its staff. Even the TSA security check has always been pleasant.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'October 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-07-09,10,10,Lexington Airport customer review,C John,"I have flown in and out of this airport on several occasions, although I don't live in Kentucky.  I mean, it is a small airport serving a small city, so don't go expecting any big city amenities other than just a couple of sit-down restaurants, a Dunkin' Donuts and a small store.  But it is surprisingly spacious, extremely clean and very modern.  Signage is clear, staff and security are friendly, the terminals are small and manageable, and there is even complex and beautiful artwork on the floor in security honoring the region's thoroughbred horse racing heritage.  Lastly, where else can you park in the parking garage, that is only around 100 feet from the terminal? The ease, simplicity, and friendliness of this airport makes it one of my favorite airports in the world, and I've been all over North America and Europe.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
