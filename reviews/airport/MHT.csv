2018-12-31,1,10,"""Forget your TSA pre-check here""",L Peck,Not Verified |  Forget your TSA pre-check here. You are still required to take you belongings out of your bag and go through that disgusting equipment that is almost as bad as being felt up. Add more time to your departure if you want to make your flight on time.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'December 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-11-02,8,10,"""terminal is not very crowded""",Alex Bouvier,"Not Verified |  The airport is on the smaller side which usually means shorter TSA lines, especially during non-rush hour times. The airport also tends not to be too crowded but can feel a little tight around the Southwest gates due to their large presence at the airport, but overall the terminal is not very crowded. I have TSA-Pre check and on my last trip through the airport in October of 2018, it probably took less than 2 minutes from when they looked at my boarding pass to when I picked my bag off of the screening belt. Talk about efficient! The parking is also cheap with always plenty of spots available. There is also a small rental car location as well which is more than adequate for an airport of its size. The terminal and the bathrooms are also kept very clean and I've never had too much of a problem. There is also some restaurant variety past the security checkpoint with there being a Starbucks, a sit-down restaurant, Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Hudson News, and a small bakery. Overall, the regional airport is a nice cheaper option rather than going to the congested Boston Logan airport and is super convenient for anyone living in the Seacoast area. The only downfall of the airport is that most flights are going to have to be connecting flights since they only fly to major hub cities and the planes tend to be smaller regional jets so I recommend to bring a very small carry on or just a backpack since it will have to be gate checked when boarding.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'October 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

",Vincent Watts,Not Verified |  Dunkin donuts coffee shop closing at 6pm on a Saturday night. Ridiculous! Flight gets delayed 1 hour and nowhere to go. Just wrong. You can get alcohol no problem. Wonder why there are issues on fights? There it is.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'June 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
