2017-02-13,9,10,"""a nice and clean airport""",E Pearson,âœ… Verified Review |  GSO is a very convenient and nice airport. Parking is super convenient right next to the terminal which makes it nice when picking up people. It is a nice and clean airport that I try and fly out of whenever I can. I only wish that I could get more direct flights out of there.,yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2016-04-03,10,10,"""a jewel of an airport""",Ian Gillies,"Piedmont Triad is just a jewel of an airport. Friendly staff, polite and helpful TSA Officers, who seem genuinely pleased to have the opportunity to chat to travellers. Add to this outstanding wi-fi connection which comes free of charge, with no time limit, and comfortable, clean and stress free surroundings. We fly here frequently from Glasgow with a connection to NC at Newark. Not as many shops or food concessions as larger airports, but at least the staff are friendly. The difference between Newark and Greensboro is really quite startling. My wife and I love this airport.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
