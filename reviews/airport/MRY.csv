What that means is fast airport screening. Curb to your gate, including clearing security, is less than five minutes. Got it? Less than Five Minutes! On the negative side, the airlines treat the airport as a step-child. Until recently United used to fly its throw-away planes here for the Pebble Beach class masses. This is slightly unusual as there are a hell of a lot of big wigs from Fortune 500 coming in for Golf and right now the Centennial celebration at Pebble Beach. Up until this month, nearly every airplane you flew on was sketchy, dodgy, a throw away plane from once upon a time, long long time ago. That is the class of airplanes coming in and out of here. Not very good. The Airline personnel on more than a few occasions were nowhere to be found. Just not there. And you look around and it looks like a ghost town in there. Really - no body there. The On-Time in bound and out bound is about - lets just say - add 1 to 5 hours to your scheduled departure or arrival. Its very obvious Monterey Airport is not a priority for the major airlines. My guess is that they are thinking if you really are a Big Wig, then you really shouldn't be flying commercial. Fly your own Jet. The services at terminal itself is - well - lets just say - it looks like an 8th grader set up a Lemonade Stand. There is one gift shop. Next door is a 7 Eleven type of place with hand made signs all over and evidence that its a one person operation. There is basically two terminals. You go left or you go right, from the scan stations. And both of these terminals are very dark. What fluorescent lighting there is here does not add to the mood of it being very dark. It sports a couple of dated TV's hanging way too close to the roof. Its a little strange - the terminals. It could definitely use some better Feng Shui. Some art perhaps. Something to make it seem more human, than ""Here is a terminal, you wanted one, here it is. It's up to code. They have lights."" The restaurant upstairs looks like it could use a renovation. Its furniture and carpet look very 1980's. I'd put money on it that the furniture and carpet is at least a few decades old. Definitely not new. Its important to note, it is not inside the gate, but outside it. The parking here, for a small airport, is pretty steep. About $13 / day long term. $20 - 25 / day Short term. Yes, that is steep. For a tiny airport flying with the average one flight per hour. This airport definitely could use some sponsor subsidizing. Bring in some of the Golf companies. Advertise it as their lounge. Why not? Thats how all the majors work. Sponsorship. Make this thing look a charming, cozy, Tiger Woods world class than midwest airport hick woods class. Clearly the airport has some negatives. Usually at nice airports you want to arrive early and spend some time in there because its such a joy. This is not one of those Airports. You want to be here only to leave. Why am I giving it 7 Stars? Its tiny and convenient. And if it ever were updated with better airplanes and facilities, it would get 10 Stars easily.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'April 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
