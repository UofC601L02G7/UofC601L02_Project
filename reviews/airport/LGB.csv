2019-09-20,8,10,"""the most pathetic car wash I've ever received""",B Baker,"✅ Trip Verified | Long Beach Airport is one of the nicest airports to fly in and out of without hassle or delays. However, if you intend to park your car with the Long Beach valet service, don't expect the complimentary car wash to be a car wash. It was the most pathetic car wash I've ever received. A toddler could have hosed it off better. The cost to park was $24 a day. I was gone on a business trip for 24 hours and when I returned I expected a nice clean car. I was wrong. Don't park your car with the valet expecting a decent Car Wash. Thank you.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'September 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 4, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2017-08-15,7,10,"""unprofessional and not appropriate""",Liza Arias,"❎ Unverified |  I fly out of Long Beach airport whenever I can, business and personal travel. My friends and family choose to do the same. I've only had good experiences until today, 8/14 while picking up a friend and her family. The bad experience was related to a Long Beach police officer monitoring vehicles curbside. I was approached by the officer as I was opening up the back of my SUV for loading luggage. He asked me to move my vehicle twice, even after I told him my friend and her family were walking over from the luggage area outside of the airport. His demeanor and tone were aggressive and he didn't care to listen when I said my friend and her family were approaching the vehicle. He raised his voice and came very close, it made me uncomfortable. Fortunately, my friend and her family walked up, greeted me and asked what was going on. The officer just walked away. The officers conduct was unprofessional and not appropriate.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival Only', 'Date Visit': 'August 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-12-01,10,10,"""a well-designed and pleasant experience""",Steven Barber,"This airport is highly recommended. Many of the reviews below are pre-2012, which is when the facility completed a full upgrade of terminal and gates. I would discard any pre-2012 reviews as ""irrelevant"" to the current condition. Long Beach Airport is a well-designed and pleasant experience compared with LAX and to a degree John Wayne. It's a smaller but more efficient facility, with competitively priced parking within an easy walk of your gate. The TSA Security Checkpoint is relatively fast compared with other airports. The facility boasts two outdoor seating areas for two of its restaurants, a comparative luxury in this age of airport design being little more than shopping malls with airline gates. The central area between the two terminals is an outdoor seating area allowing for a retreat from the madness at the gates. One of the unique aspects of LGB is the lack of jetways. Walking out onto the tarmac to board a plane is a fun and different experience which adds significantly to the charm of this facility. Long Beach doesn't have the cold and sterile feel of most modern airports, and that is a welcome aspect of flying here. There are a number of restaurant/eating choices available, though the shopping is a relatively weak area. In general, Long Beach is easily my favorite American airport and is qualitatively far better than the vast majority of facilities I use.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 4, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-11-28,10,10,"""open, natural, and airy terminal""",Anurag Dave,"As you pull into Long Beach Airport, the parking structure is conveniently located right across from the terminal. Check-in and security screening took less than 10 minutes in the afternoon hours. Long Beach has an open, natural, and airy terminal. You will find palm trees, small birds, and abundance of sunshine on this terminal. There are enough seats for you to sit and relax. Dining options are very good. Free wi-fi also works well. This airport does not use jet bridge, so you will enter and exit the aircraft using stairs or ramp. Baggage claim area is small, but appropriate for an airport with a vintage look.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'November 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2015-10-05,10,10,"""small and so very easy to deal with""",Richelle Corbo,"I fly to LGB twice a year or more to visit family. I really cannot say enough good things about this airport especially after the remodel a couple of years ago. The place is beautiful. It is well laid out, it is small and so very easy to deal with. I fly Jet Blue and it is almost always on time. The restaurants in that terminal are quality and very reasonably priced. This was one of the first airports to provide unlimited free wifi. I love that you can board and leave the plane from both the front and rear. It is so quick. If you have to fly to So Cal this is the place to fly too.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'April 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 5, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 5, 'Wifi Connectivity': 5, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-11-21,7,10,Long Beach Airport customer review,Tom Sappington,I've always enjoyed flying in and out of Long Beach Airport but this time was a big disappointment. They used to have remote lots for long-term parking at a reasonable price but now those have been shut down. At this point the only option is the short-term parking which is a bit of a walk from the terminal with a cost of $2/hour maxing out at $17/day or $19/day depending on which building you use. That really adds up!,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2010-06-30,4,10,Long Beach Airport customer review,W Burke,At first I was concerned seeing the long lines at JetBlue's curbside check-in and at the check-in counter on my way to the upstairs restaurant to eat dinner before my flight. Restaurant is good but not cheap but not outrageously priced considering portions and food quality. Was through security with minimal wait less than 10 minutes. No jetways here so you have to walk on the tarmac to board your plane via stairs. Only complaint is terminal building is too small considering the number of people that pass through. Still I would continue to use LGB to avoid LAX every day of the week and twice on Sunday.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2009-03-10,5,10,Long Beach Airport customer review,Mike Rosenzweig,This is such a convenient airport. Reminds me of a small mid-west airport where you park close by check in and at the gate so quickly. While not a lot of fancy amenities like the larger international airports this airport is such a breeze.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-09-14,5,10,Long Beach Airport customer review,Michael Parker,It is simply an airport and not trying to be a shopping mall or anything else. Very quick passage through the airport if you're only dropping off bags; TSA efficient but thorough; bit of a crowd in the north portakabin as JetBlue DL and AS had simultaneous departures but as you can turn up so close to departure it's not a long wait. Restaurant upstairs is good as well though not cheap and it would be good to have more of the balcony given to non-eaters (maybe it's busier midweek than on a Sunday afternoon).,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-06-26,3,10,Long Beach Airport customer review,W Donovan,Long Beach is a great little airport. It has the most efficient TSA checkpoint I have ever seen with the longest line ever being about three minutes and I fly through here quite often. While the south concourse is the only gate area I have used I am sure the airport is the same throughout the terminal. The staff is great and friendly and you can chat with everyone. The gate numbering can be a bit confusing but so long as you don't immediately exit the terminal to the left you should be fine. They even give you an umbrella when it rains to walk onto the plane.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
