2019-01-07,4,10,"""an absolute mess""",K Tolbert,"✅ Trip Verified | We arrived 5 days ago at night and the rental car situation was an absolute mess. When we showed up at the airport today during the daylight, it wasn’t much easier to figure out the mess outside. The Allegiant check in staff seemed overworked and grumpy. The airport needs some serious traffic flow help inside and outside.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'January 2019', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Family Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2017-11-17,1,10,"""Very few chairs and much confusion""
",G Andrews,"❎ Unverified |  Airport still ""under construction"". It looks just like it did when I flew into and out of in April of 2017. Passengers for 3 departing planes are all herded into a very small room. Very few chairs and much confusion. When will it be finished? And then passenger must walk outside through rain/etc to board planes and walk up steep ramps! Very poor! Only saw one womens bathroom with only 3 stalls.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'November 2017', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 1, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2015-09-17,10,10,"""lines moved smoothly and additional lines were opened""",Jim Scotto,What great TSA staff have at St Pete-Clearwater Airport. The lines moved smoothly and additional lines were opened when it became crowded. The food court consists of one small shop where the food is OK.

2015-06-18,1,10,St Pete-Clearwater Airport customer review,Albert Kelley,"Like Punta Gorda, Florida, this airport is serviced by Allegiant Airlines. The physical building and TSA staffing can not handle the volume of passengers. When flights are departing/arriving, every inch of the building is full of people. It is a fire hazard and impossible for people to move through the terminal. As a result, one needs to plan for spending hours there to get to your gate and then the flight will most likely also be late in departing. If you need to check luggage, it is even more of a nightmare. Parking and signage is also inadequate.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
