2024-02-06,1,10,"""What a mess of an airport""",C Mayes,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a mess of an airport. From TSA to space for waiting and eating. The open airport area may be nice in the spring and fall but is not practical and dangerous during rain, heat and/or colder times. Whoever thought this was a good idea maybe was ok many years ago but it’s not practical nor safe with huddle and bustle and people trying to get between gates and terminal’s quickly in the rain. TSA is also not appropriately spaced and or staffed for the current passenger load. Then, try to grab a bite to eat and you are out of luck with the 1 1/2 hour wait to get in and order food in the 1 very small restaurant. This airport needs a lot of work to safely and comfortably accommodate the passenger load.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'February 2024', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Couple Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 2, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Airport Staff': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"

2011-10-29,10,10,Palm Springs Airport customer review,J Marshall,Great little airport. Everything in one location - baggage belts next to car hire desks and you walk out into the car park and collect your car. Will be my preferred choice now rather than coming in via LAX or SAN and facing a 2 hour drive.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2008-06-02,4,10,Palm Springs Airport customer review,N Prestage,PSP is a great little airport. The 60's style terminal is fairly well designed but with the advent of security screening areas its a bit harder to negotiate. Rental cars are right outside the door from the baggage carousels. The weather is seldom a problem so flights stay pretty close to their schedules. Parking is reasonably priced and convenient to the terminal.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-03-25,4,10,Palm Springs Airport customer review,H Fehr,"PSP is a beautiful airport in the ""secured"" area. However the check-in to the security point is a long walk for the many retired people that travel through this airport. The open air feeling is great in this warm climate. The biggest negative is that when there is poor weather and those times are few is the lack of technology for pilots to land. During a rain storm and low visibility we were delayed 30 minutes while circling and then continued to Los Angelos then bussed back to Palm Springs.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2007-07-10,4,10,Palm Springs Airport customer review,John Oram,I arrived at PSP from SFO. I have used the airport from time to time in the past. It is quite capable of coping with its traffic but has experienced one major improvement whereby hired cars can now be collected on site. This is very welcome especially when the heat is high.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
