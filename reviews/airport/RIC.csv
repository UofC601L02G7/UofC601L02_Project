2022-05-16,5,10,"""TSA pre check is so slow""",W Kusnierz,"Not Verified |  TSA pre check is so slow. It’s supposed to be faster than general boarding, that’s what I’m paying for. The lady doing the check in appears to be new or just slow. She needs help. 7am, 5/16/22.",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'May 2022', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 1, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 1, 'Terminal Seating': 1, 'Terminal Signs': 2, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 2, 'Airport Staff': 2, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2020-06-08,1,10,"""TSA was extremely rude""",Savannah Hughes,"✅ Trip Verified |  Never had a problem til now. TSA was extremely rude, they were pushing everyone around, not just me. Speaking to me as if I were a child. This was 8th June at 6 am. No respect whatsoever, very unprofessional. It was obvious they were abusing their authority",,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'June 2020', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 2, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 5, 'Food Beverages': 0, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2018-08-09,1,10,"""This was the worst airport""",B James,Not Verified |  This was the worst airport I have ever been to. The people are extremely rude and short. It seemed like common behavior from the TSA agents to the store/restaurant clerks. Seems like the pre requisite to work here is you have to be rude. I will avoid this airport at all costs in the future.,,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'August 2018', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 3, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 2, 'Terminal Signs': 3, 'Food Beverages': 1, 'Airport Shopping': 1, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Airport Staff': 1, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2013-07-09,5,10,Richmond Airport customer review,Rich Hutchens,"Airport is clean and seems to be efficient as airports go. However the food service is dismal. There are no brand fast-food which is what we needed in order to catch a bus out to a conference center. The only offering was some place called Cheeburger Cheeburger (yes a dated reference to an old SNL staple) which food was neither fast nor flavorful. Fries were greasy meat was half-cooked and the service was slow. Certainly an ""international Airport"" can do better.",,"{'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 4, 'Airport Shopping': 3, 'Recommended': 'no'}"
2012-02-23,9,10,Richmond Airport customer review,Tim Buntin,My experiences have always been pleasant. Security lines are extremely short and there is a lot of open space. Checking in is never a hassle-we have been able to pass by the check-in desk in 20 minutes or less on the worst of days. Bathrooms are clean and there's always a cafe or news store open. Delta seems to have the largest concentration of flights at the airport most of them being on their regional affiliates running under Delta Connection. Overall the airport is very good clean and friendly.,yes,"{'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Airport Shopping': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2009-07-12,5,10,Richmond Airport customer review,Charles Strad,"Richmond International is a new stylish and perfect sized airport on the outskirts of Richmond. 9 major air carriers serve RIC flying to over 22 domestic and international destinations in the USA and Canada. The airport is medium-sized and easy to find your way around. The security lines are short and hassle-free. The airport atrium has a large glass roof giving the airport interior a very ""open"" feel. A restaurant in the atrium has a large window with a full view of the apron for all the plane spotters. Travel into and out of RIC is always hassle-free and fun.",,{'Recommended': 'no'}
2008-08-13,5,10,Richmond Airport customer review,M Keenan,Richmond is a medium size airport that has recently been extensively renovated. My experience flying in and out was very pleasant – RIC is a “human sized” airport so it is easy to get around. Baggage recovery was fast and painless with our checked bags appearing only about five minutes after we had arrived at the carousel. The rental car desks are conveniently sited and the rental car garage is a two minute walk from the terminal. Our total time from landing to driving off in a rental car was less than thirty minutes. The airport is well connected to the adjacent Interstate highway so the airport is easy to get into and out of. On departure check-in and security was quick and painless. There is a restaurant in the secure area offering a view of the ramp a pleasant thing for the travelling aircraft buff. Overall I was very impressed with Richmond airport and would use it again anytime.,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
