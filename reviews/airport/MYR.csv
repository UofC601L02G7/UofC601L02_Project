2017-01-21,7,10,"""airport did not disappoint me""",G Berenyi,"✅ Verified Review |  For a small beachside city developed as a getaway destination for North Americans, this little modern airport did not disappoint me. Getting through security was a breeze (very friendly TSA), and compared to other airports I've been to, navigating is easy enough. If you are someone who goes to the airport not just to fly but to shop mountains of stuff this airport might not be for you, granted it has somewhere between 15 and 20 gates total, and there is no gargantuan walkway of duty-free shops to be found. The terminal is very modern and clean. For some reason, despite being first in line for takeoff, it did take us about 15 min to get off of the ground. Lots of general aviation, so this might be a regular thing. Bottom line, would I fly here? Absolutely. This airport is all about convenience and efficiency.",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Departure Only', 'Date Visit': 'December 2016', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Solo Leisure', 'Queuing Times': 5, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 5, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Terminal Signs': 4, 'Food Beverages': 3, 'Airport Shopping': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 4, 'Airport Staff': 5, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
