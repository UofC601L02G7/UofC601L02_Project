2023-05-15,1,10,"""TSA is unorganized and slow""",T Barnes,Not Verified |  This airport is horrible. TSA is unorganized and slow. Please do not underestimate this small airport please get there 2 hours early maybe 3 because TSA will slow you down. I’m not sure who is in charge of TSA but you need have better protocol.

Get there 2 hrs early these days. TSA painfully slow. No sense of urgency or willingness to help. Horrible. Cost my company thousands in missed meetings.

2015-07-11,8,10,Syracuse Hancock Airport customer review,Kathleen King,"Having lived in the area all of my life, I've flown out of Syracuse Hancock for years. It is a smallish regional airport with a few places to eat. The bathroom facilities are abundant and clean while gate areas are somewhat outdated and a little shopworn. The airport is divided into two main departure/arrival wings; previously each had its own TSA screening area. Recent renovations resulted in consolidation to a single TSA screening area with capacity to manage both gate wings. Because I was not aware of the renovations, I took my usual path to my assigned gate only to find that I had to backtrack to the TSA area and then back out to the gate. Perhaps further renovations (and/or improvements in signage) could result in more a more direct and efficient pathway to TSA. Once through the mostly efficient TSA process, the walk to the gate was fairly quick and straightforward. TSA lines can be long (but not like LAX, DCA, etc.) during peak periods so be prepared. Parking is adjacent to the terminal with very reasonable rates. I've left my car there for a few days at a time without concern. While sometimes flights are less expensive out of nearby cities (Rochester, Buffalo, Albany for example) I choose to fly out of Syracuse because it is so accessible. Lastly, the ""Syracuse"" illuminated sign on the gate area has welcomed passengers for decades with its comforting deco appearance!",yes,"{'Experience At Airport': 'Arrival and Departure', 'Date Visit': 'July 2015', 'Type Of Traveller': 'Business', 'Queuing Times': 4, 'Terminal Cleanliness': 3, 'Terminal Seating': 3, 'Food Beverages': 2, 'Wifi Connectivity': 3, 'Recommended': 'yes'}"
2011-01-03,3,10,Syracuse Hancock Airport customer review,D Fitz,Small and always a risk for bad weather but they do an amazing job clearing the snow (closed less than 24 hrs per year despite getting more snow on average than any comparable city). Rarely any delays at counters or security. Free WiFi. Not much in the way of food or shopping. No public transportation into Syracuse (taxi only).,,{'Recommended': 'no'}
