2024-09-17,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Puerto Rico to Ft. Laughterdale via Las Vegas,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,terrible customer service team,False,"  Jetblue is a terrible airline. I am disabled, but the flight attendants do not care at all. I had a terrible experience where I actually fell and hit my head while trying to put my shoes on after going through security. In the process of doing this, I had torn my shorts. I had no idea until one of my children (I had both with me) pointed it out as I was boarding. I entered the plane and asked the first flight attendant that I was disabled and my pants were torn so bad that there was everything showing. He told me to go to the back of the plane and I could change in the restroom. I headed toward the back, as I was instructed (the plane was boarding and filling up) but I was stopped by a very nasty female flight attendant. She told me that I couldn't use the back bathroom. I told her what had happened, but she laughed at me and told me ""you're going to have to the the one at the front of the plane. Good Luck!"" I started crying and begged her not to make me walk with my backside exposed through the plane, but she laughed and ignored me. I went up front crying, and everyone was pointing and staring at me. Later, when serving soda, the same attendant came up to me and told me that I was rude because I was crying. Then, I told her that I would file a complaint and she laughed. She told me good luck, again. The thing is, she wasn't wrong. Jetblue has a terrible customer service team. No one would help me at all. I was told to take it to social media by the ""customer service rep"" and so I did. Their response was whoops, sorry. 'They won't talk to you directly, they won't do anything to make it better, and trust them (they forwarded my concerns). Then they quit responding all together.",-1
2024-09-07,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Chicago,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,amazing legroom,True," I checked in the day before on the JetBlue app, no hassle whatsoever. Arrived at JFK two hours prior to my flight, it was very crowded and took about 40 minutes to get through security. Boarding was done very fast and flew on brand new plane N3221J which had been delivered two weeks ago to the airline. Everything was sleek and new, tons of content to choose from on the inflight entertainment, free wifi, free snacks and drinks and amazing legroom on this two hour flight. Crew was professional but not so friendly aside from that it was a good experience on this short two hour hop to the Windy City.",1
2024-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Cancun to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,"Avoid at all costs"" ",True,"   Worst airline ever. Avoid at all costs. The online managing of the trip doesn't work. Spent 45 minuted waiting to ""chat"" with agent without resolution. Can't check in, had to do it at the airport. Got overcharged to check in a bag because of that. Inflight Wi fi does not work.",-1
2024-08-30,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,JetBlue experience was terrific,False,"  We flew with JetBlue and Turkish Airlines back in early August. This trip was super important to my fiance and me because it was his first time seeing his family in three years. Unfortunately, our first connecting flight to Boston was delayed, and we would not make our next flight, ruining the whole trip. This trip could've taken a horrible turn and not happened at all. However, Alex, a JetBlue customer service agent at the airport, came to our rescue! She was super knowledgeable, understanding, and caring about our entire trip. Alex was able to help us through this stressful situation and change our flight schedule so that we would be able to make it to our final destination. During the process, she gave us every option we could choose, along with what had happened the past couple of days so we could make an informed decision. Alex also answered all 100 questions my fiance had about changes being made and confirmed time and time again that we would have our luggage and tickets for all flights. After working with Alex, our international trip was as smooth as an international trip can be! Our JetBlue experience was terrific, thanks to Alex! Sadly, JetBlue will no longer be at Charlotte Airport, or we would be repeat customers!",1

2024-08-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to LaGuardia,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4,entire experience was traumatic,True,"   I am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with the treatment my family and I received during our recent travel experience with JetBlue. We were unjustifiably removed from the boarding line by a JetBlue supervisor, which caused significant distress and inconvenience. Upon arriving at the airport, we went through security and proceeded to the gate. Unfortunately, there was a gate change and ground delays, and we were not notified of this gate change via the JetBlue app or by text message. Despite checking in (before TSA ) and receiving our boarding passes, we were informed that the gate would be notified of our approach. However, upon arriving at the gate, which was still open with boarding in progress, the on barding crew member chose to yell at me and greeted me with ""its closed"". I then proceeded to tell them it's still open- the sign said boarding - so the supervisor allowed us into the line they even scanned our boarding pass. Because we were visibly upset at the way they were treating us (lacked emotional awareness, empathy, and intelligence) Something about my demeanor didn't rub the supervisor the right way and he kicked my husband, infant and I out of the line. He didn't care the gate had changed and we weren't notified, he didn't care we had a child and it was already an evening flight, he didn't care I was mosaic, he didn't care I was on time. It was his time to use his supervisor badge and assert his ""authority"". This was a deliberate act towards my family. The staff's attitude was both rude and lacking in compassion, further exacerbating an already stressful situation. We were ultimately rerouted to another airport at a later time, which caused additional inconvenience. Which by the way - he did not help us set it up. He actually looked at us in the eyes and said ""I aint helping you. Figure it out."" This entire experience was traumatic and reflects poorly on JetBlue’s brand, which is known for prioritizing customer service and care.",-1
2024-08-20,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"my case was denied"" ",False,"  I purchased four tickets for my family to Newark and in my way back, flight was delayed three times, and at 11:00 pm, flight was cancelled. I came from a cruise, have no family member in NJ, and sleep in a hotel fof two days and I ended up purchase another ticket with allegiant that cost me $1335.07 , car rental $256.12 and Uber $216.00, and parking for my car at Tampa airport where I left my car $200.00. I have a master card with JetBlue which came an insurance, but my case was denied. See below email from JetBlue I just received. Hello Herold, We sincerely apologize for the disruption you experienced during your JetBlue flight 873 on 2024-08-06. We appreciate the opportunity to address your reimbursement request. Upon careful review, we regret to inform you that JetBlue flight 873 does not meet the criteria for reimbursement as this disruption was uncontrollable. The flight was canceled due to crew legality as a result of inclement weather throughout the day. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

2024-08-17,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to New York JFK,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3,the worst airline ever,True,"   Absolutely the worst airline ever, as a frequent traveller using the best and also the budget friendly airlines I have to rank Jetblue under even the budget. Sure you can tack on for everything- something Jetblue has done just like the budget airlines.  The attitude of JetBlue both on board and CS reflects a very bad atmosphere going on there. CS I have to rank an absolute 0. Not the first time I have had issues with them- but no more - I have given up my flight credit and ff miles and will never fly Jetblue again. The circumstances surrounding my delay/emergency landing/re-book were absolutely hideous! Jetblue can blame others for the issue but they are the ones to blame in the way they handled it.",-1
2024-08-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Turks and Caicos,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,poor treatment and unhelpful staff,True," I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience with JetBlue Airways that I feel compelled to share. Despite arriving on time, my pregnant wife and I, along with our two small children, were not allowed to board our flight. This ordeal was not only highly stressful but also completely unacceptable. The gate agents were unhelpful and showed a complete lack of empathy towards our situation. Traveling with a pregnant woman and two babies is challenging enough without having to deal with such unnecessary obstacles. JetBlue's handling of this situation was appalling. We made it to the gate on time, yet we were turned away with no reasonable explanation. This level of customer service is simply unacceptable for an airline that claims to value its passengers. I expected much better from JetBlue and will think twice before booking with them again. If you're considering flying with JetBlue, be prepared for the possibility of poor treatment and unhelpful staff.",-1
2024-08-14,0.2,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Cancun to Ft Lauderdale,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3,"Worst travel experience"" ",True,"   Worst travel experience, my flight was changed 10 times since this morning. This is not a serious airline. I called the customer service and spoke with Karla and she said that she didn't have a reason why my flight was changes many times in the past few hours",-1
2024-08-13,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Diego,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,,5.0,5,smiling crew was so positive,True,"   I have flown Jetblue many times. I like their timeliness, service, customer-friendliness and ownership they take to solve issues. In my recent travel, I liked that they had a booth, titled JUST ASK, with live agents for customer questions. I was not assigned a seat while booking, so when I asked the agent in this booth, they were extremely polite. The agent at the terminal gave us excellent seats in the front with extra leg room without any additional charge. The whole experience, check-in, spacious seating, space for carry-on luggage, boarding, snacks, cleanliness and smiling crew was so positive, I told quite a few people and if I have a choice, I would go with JetBlue again--my first choice. My only suggestions-- provide earphones so passengers could watch/hear movies and shows. Also, movie and TV show choice was limited.",1
2024-08-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Montego Bay via New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst travel experience,True,"   I recently had the absolute misfortune of flying with JetBlue, and I can confidently say it was the worst travel experience I’ve ever encountered. The flight was delayed by an unforgivable 40 hours due to a situation that was entirely JetBlue’s fault — a fact they even admitted. However, this was just the beginning of a nightmare that no one should ever have to endure. First off, the customer service is beyond atrocious. The representatives were rude, unprofessional, and completely indifferent to the chaos they caused. It was like dealing with a bunch of heartless robots programmed to give you the runaround until you finally give up. Their WhatsApp support is a joke—automated responses that lead nowhere, and if you’re lucky enough to reach a human, the call mysteriously disconnects. They don’t even have a proper landline, which is just another indication of how little they care about their customers. They charge you for seats and baggage online, but when you arrive at the airport, they try to scam you into paying again. It’s disgraceful and unethical. The seats on the plane are uncomfortable and faulty, and the so-called “food” is revolting — hardly edible and not worth the price they charge. As if that wasn’t enough, when the delay happened, the staff knew from the start it would be 5 hours, but they posted just a 1-hour delay on the boards. It’s clear they were trying to manipulate us into staying at the airport longer. And when it became obvious that we wouldn’t be flying that night, they refused to provide us with hotels, transport, or even food vouchers until we literally had to fight for it. The level of disrespect and lack of care for their passengers was unbelievable. This airline treats its customers like caged animals, showing absolutely no regard for their comfort or well-being. The entire experience was disgusting, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I have already warned my entire network to avoid JetBlue at all costs, and I strongly urge anyone reading this to do the same. JetBlue is a scam wrapped in an airline, and they should be ashamed of the way they operate. Do yourself a favor and never fly with JetBlue. They don’t deserve your money, your time, or your trust.",-1
2024-08-11,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Chicago,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5,seats were very comfortable,True,   Flew on my birthday to Chicago and decided to use some trueblue pints I had for this flight. Check in was done on my phone on the day of the flight I did have to wait about 15 minutes in line to drop my luggage off. The flight itself was pretty fast 1h50mins. Snacks were provided along with drinks. The plane itself was on the older side but seats were very comfortable. Unfortunately the TVs didn’t work so I pulled out my iPad. JetBlue still had good service on this short domestic flight.,1
2024-08-08,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Martha's Vineyard,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4,really disappointed in this airline,False,"  Jetblue might be the worst airline I have ever flown. I fly quite frequently and Jetblue is usually the cheapest option however the amount of hassle and stress this airline has put me through is not worth it. The past 5 flights I have taken with Jetblue 4 have been delayed by over 2 hours and 1 was fully cancelled. The fully canceled one had us sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours trying to ""find a route"" (there were storms). They then returned us to the gate and told us we could get off the aircraft if we wanted to stretch our legs (Mind you this flight was supposed to leave at 5:45 pm- the time was then 10 pm). Once off the aircraft, they prevented us from going back on to take our seats again. After one more hour of waiting to return to the aircraft - they decided to cancel the flight. The time was now 11 pm. But DONT WORRY, they gave us a $12 voucher for airport food. I really disappointed in this airline. I will be looking at other options in the future.",-1
2024-08-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a terrible company,True," My flight has been canceled and Jetblue didn't offer any alternative. They said I had to spend one more night in New Orleans and find another flight by myself the next day (all the flights for the same day were fully booked even with other companies). I missed worked on monday, I spent an extra $100 for a hotel, an extra $50 for a taxi, extra money for food, and an extra $270 for a new flight. And Jetblue refused to give me a refund for that. They didn't care at all. They are neglectful, and the customer service is terrible. The customer service closed the chat without my consent. Just because I was showing her she didn't respect the regulations made by the department of transportation. They'd rather cut off the conversation when you know your rights. They disregard the regulation and they make their own rules. Flights are always delayed or canceled with Jetblue. It's a terrible company. Avoid it because your trip is gonna cost extra money because of them.",-1
2024-08-07,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Vancouver,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,“simple and hassle-free”,False," Jetblue provided simple and hassle-free travel including comfortable seats, excellent service and reliable flight times. Would highly recommend this route.",1
2024-08-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Nightmare customer service,True,"   Nightmare customer service. My flight was cancelled after I cleared security and none of the Jetblue staff at the airport will help. They direct me to a web portal that is broken, from an email with a broken link. Then the customer service chat or phone call takes over 2 hours. When I got to a customer service representative, they tell me the next flight will only be in 3 days. 3 days that I will have to spend - without compensation for food or accommodation (because this isn't the EU) in one of the most expensive city in the world on a short notice. The customer service will play you like a tennis ball. The airside staff told me to speak to the staff at baggage reclaim, the baggage staff tells me to speak to the staff at check-in, the check-in staff says I need to call the customer service line. The customer service line barely helps me with what the rebooking portal in the app was supposed to do instantly. All throughout, nobody would give me a reason on why my flight was cancelled. The rebooking portal is broken for unknown reasons, and that is hours of my life that I will never get back. The only reason I am flying the rebooked flight is because I need to get to my destination for work and to catch my long haul return flight. I will never be a JetBlue customer ever again in my life if I can help it.",-1
2024-08-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,White Plains to Palm Beach,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,never fly with JetBlue ever again,False,"  Our plane was supposed to leave at 8:40pm, got to the airport at 7:00pm. The plane was rerouted to another airport, they said due to weather (meanwhile it was raining yes but not bad not lightning or anything). When the plane arrived they had everyone come to the gate, the lady gave passengers seat numbers if they didn’t have one already then someone came up and shut the door (this was at 1:20am). They said the pilots have timed out, ok mind you there was another plane going to palm beach as well that was rerouted to another airport as well and they were supposed to leave at 5:30pm but that plane didn’t arrive in Ny until about 12:45am and those pilots timed out as well. They found pilots for the plane that was supposed to leave at 5:30pm but not for my flight. The next flight they had going out to Florida wasn’t until Tuesday in all airports in the surrounding areas. On their website it says they’re supposed to help with hotels and a food voucher if it was a controllable situation which its was if they were doing their jobs properly but they refused to give us passengers anything. Also when they finally cancelled the flight I was like 4th or 5th in line and they didn’t even say anything about stand by seats, but gave it to customers that were way farther down in the line. They are very unprofessional with the way this whole disaster was being handled. We had to purchase more tickets for a different flight with a whole different flight company to get home that following days. Was at the airport for 17 1/2 hours before we got on the plane to come home. I will never fly with JetBlue ever again. They really need to get it together because they had multiple planes pilots time out that same evening at different airports. Oh also the insurance was purchased as well with JetBlue",-1
2024-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to New York JFK,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,4,last time I will purchase from this airline,True,   I flew from Vancouver to JFK and then from JFK back to Vancouver On both occasions the flight was delayed by 2 hours and 1 hour respectively. No reason was given. Why is it now 6 hours and 15 minutes flying time instead of 5 hours? Totally unacceptable. This is the last time I will purchase from this airline,-1
2024-08-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to New York JFK,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never be flying with them again,True,"   For years JetBlue was my preferred airline. JetBlue cancelled my direct flight and rescheduled me for a flight with a connection over a day later. They refused to compensate me for the downgrade, which was merely the cherry on top. I am writing a day before my flight and have had to cancel a job, costing me $350 in lost income. The delayed arrival will cost me 5 hours in lost time and I will be responsible for purchasing overpriced food at the airport. Even though they made the decision to cancel the original flight, they refuse to make me whole. Despite having requested $500 in compensation for all losses incurred, I would have been happy to spend many multiples of that amount with JetBlue prior to this episode. Now that they have shown an attitude of total disrespect and lack of concern for the passenger, I will never be flying with them again.",-1
2024-07-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York City to Albuquerque,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,extreme dissatisfaction,True,"  I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the abysmal service I received from JetBlue on Sunday, June 23 2024. My flight from New York City to Albuquerque, scheduled for 8:00 PM that evening, was unceremoniously canceled without any notification or updates from Jetblue. This unacceptable lack of communication left my friend and me stranded at the airport overnight, forced to sleep in the terminal due to your negligence. It wasn't until we took matters into our own hands and contacted customer service the following day that we were able to secure new flights for Tuesday - a full two days later than our original itinerary. To add insult to injury, our rebooked journey involved an unnecessary and inconvenient layover in Seattle, further prolonging our travel time. We finally arrived in Albuquerque at 7:00 PM on Tuesday, a staggering 47 hours later than initially planned. Jetblue's failure to provide timely information or assistance during this ordeal is inexcusable. We incurred additional hotel expenses on Monday night as a direct result of JetBlue's mishandling of this situation. Yet JetBlue refused to reimburse our extra expense.",-1

No offer or compensation for changes. No assistance to loyal members. Missed flight due to gate change. No notice on app or email of change and no offer of refund or assistance with impact to customer. Told to bad. Loyalty member for several years with 37,000 points list and no recourse.

2024-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rochester to New York,,,,,,1.0,1,JetBlue is a terrible airline,True,"  JetBlue is a terrible airline. I needed to be in New York to catch a connecting flight to London. Our JetBlue flight kept getting delayed until it was delayed passed the departure time of my connecting flight. Then they cancelled it without explanation. I was told they would rebook it and to check my emails. In the meantime I had to get a hotel room and rental car beyond my original plans at my cost. I decided to call later and I found out that they rebooked all the flights for the next day. That means I was forced stay yet another night at my expense. They told me they do not reimburse for these costs that were not my fault. They told me there was a flight but at 5:45am. I basically said they were useless which they are. I called another airline who rebooked me, but for a better time. !!",-1
2024-07-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Phoenix,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2,first and last time flying Jetblue,True,"  We flew round trip from Phoenix to Boston. On the way there the flight attendant told us the infant we were traveling with was required to sit in a middle seat due to safety reasons, on our way back the attendant told us the infant has to sit next to a window for safety reasons. The staff don't seam trained very well. Also on our return flight I accidently purchased an extra check in ticket on the kiosk, the bag handler confidently told us we can call customer service and get a refund after we land as long as the tag is not scanned. After landing we called and they refused to refund me for the accident, and both the agent and the escalation specialist I spoke to confirmed that their crew in the airports are not trained on their policies. For an wealthy airline that does not allow carry on, and charges for every checked bag, this was ridiculous. I flew with 5 other passengers, and this is our first and last time flying Jetblue.",-1
2024-07-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Buffalo to London via New York,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,Generally not worth the hassle,True,"  JetBlue cancelled the first leg of the flight from Buffalo to New York (then connecting to London), they said due to bad weather. Staff tried to be helpful, but the next flight was the day after. No help for a hotel room, no support for food/drink, basically nothing at all. Flights are very often delayed, chaos with permanently changing gate. You get dozens of emails about your flights being changed back and forth - before eventually getting cancelled. On board it's ok-ish. Great is wifi and life tv, good legroom. Otherwise low cost standard: ""free snacks"" until they run out, food is not great. Small aircraft for overseas flight, everything is dated, rotting and not clean. Smallest bathrooms I have ever seen. Generally not worth the hassle.",-1
2024-07-09,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bradley International to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Got scammed for $450.00 dollars,False,"   Got scammed for $450.00 dollars when JetBlue changed my daughter's trip to Disney with her 2 sons aged 4 and 7 and her husband when she looked and saw the itinerary had been changed and the return leg of their round trip tickets had the parents separated from the children, I, the grandfather purchased the tickets and had the kids sitting with the parents and having 2 window seats. When JetBlue decided to change the flight they separated the parents from the kids on the flight. When my daughter called and tried to get them back together they told her there were only 4 seats together and it would cost an additional $450.00 dollars to get them safely back together. She had a choice, cancel trip or pay the extortion fee of $450.00, she got absolutely no help with customer service nor did I having spent about 2 hours of being jerked around and finally speaking to a resolutions manager and getting no sympathy or offer to change or remove the fees for the changes they made. First time and last time dealing with this airline, betting this is a common occurrence and a nice sleazy way to get more money from people. Be careful booking with these people they have no interest in making your trip anything other than a money grabbing affair, great way for us to start our vacation.",-1
2024-07-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancún to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,“cant believe the greed of this company”,True," I really cant believe the greed of this company. I had a vacation to mexico with my daughter from the 5-9. Unfortunately there was a Hurricane and had to change dates, not due to my choice or personal matter, but due to a natural disater. My departure was with AA and they changed my tickets dates without a problem. However my return was with Jetblue and I had to cancel my tickets to get a petty $80 credit on $350 tickets. Had to repurchase for a later date and spent $380 without luggage of which the previous flight included. Stop being so petty especially with your customers in a situation which involved a natural disaster.",-1
2024-07-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to San Juan,,,,,,1.0,1,Lost a long time customer,True,"  JetBlue cancelled my dad’s flight with no explanation as to why. Rebooked on their own for 2 days later for a time that was not convenient, when I reached out to customer service to rebook to a different airport (closer to my home) and a time convenient for me, after waiting for two hrs one hr for regular customer service and one hr for escalations was told that they were very sorry for the inconvenience but that there was nothing that they could do. Was told I could cancel get reimbursed and buy a new ticket in the airport I wanted which would have cost me triple the amount of the original price. All I wanted was to change the airport (same airline) since they cancelled his flight but was told they couldn’t do it. JetBlue does not care to accommodate their customers for inconvenience caused by them. Just heard news that due to traffic control staff shortages in JFK flights had to be cancelled, delayed or redirected to different airports so don’t believe the “weather conditions” excuse. Shame on JetBlue for not valuing their customers. Lost a long time customer in me, my family and anyone I can spare the headache!",-1

My flight from JFK, scheduled for 2:10 PM on June 30, 2024, was continuously delayed and eventually canceled at 3:01 PM, with no explanation provided. Several other JetBlue flights to different destinations were also canceled, clearly visible on the monitors. The delay of the Miami flight was attributed to a shortage of crew. It is evident that JetBlue does not value their customers' time, impacting their ability to spend time with loved ones. I am thoroughly disappointed with JetBlue's service and have no intention of flying with them again, nor will I recommend them.

2024-06-15,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Philadelphia,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3,so considerate and helpful,True,"  My day started horrible with Jet Blue, in Seattle there is a lot of construction, I was told by the airline I flew into Seattle on to arrive at least 4 to 5 hours early because TSA lines are extra long because some are closed due to the construction. Well I got there 5 hours early to sit at the Jet Blue desk waiting to check my bag for hours because there was no customer service representative until 2 hours before the flight. So at 9:15 am finally someone arrived. Today June 14th there was a lot of storms that delayed flights. So I was unable to make my connection flight to Philadelphia, Victoria in Jet Blue baggage service was so helpful and made this high stress travel day end on a great note by helping get my bag in a very timely manner, set me up in a hotel and was just so considerate and helpful through the whole process. All of the woman in Boston Baggage service for jet blue was all very helpful and you could tell they was passionate about their jobs.",1

The seats were comfortable, had many entertainment options, but food was not as good. Customer service was very poor. I ended up getting delayed at JFK because staff said they needed to wait for an aircraft that was late arriving at JFK. I asked JetBlue help desk about standby on an early flight, and said I would likely not be getting on that flight. I highly advise not flying JetBlue though JFK, as I have always been delayed, and staff are very rude. If you fly JetBlue, I highly recommend flying through Boston instead of JFK.",-1

Probably JetBlue believes it is a smart marketing move to sell as many 10-dollar blankets as possible. That is so obvious. Window seats were especially cold. I am afraid my wife will get sick because of that. When a flight attendant was asked about it she said that they had just brought it up a moment ago. Pretty cynical. No shame,-1

2024-05-03,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Nassau,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,Bye bye jetBlue,True,"  Booked for a direct flight from Orlando to Nassau, Bahamas, which left later than scheduled. The flight was short enough that the crew served water, soft drinks, and snacks only. The A320 was old, and showed its wear on most surfaces and scuffed seating surfaces. The entertainment screens mounted on seatbacks did not work. At all. There was no wifi as advertised. But the crew was friendly, and the flight was smooth. Upon our arrival, we retrieved one of two checked bags from the baggage claim area. I spoke with a very helpful jetBlue representative in baggage claim, who discovered that our second checked bag was still in Orlando. With all of my beachwear, hats, dinner clothing, snorkel gear, medications and my cigars (addiction gladly acknowledged). I asked the jetBlue rep when the bag would be delivered, and she stated that it would be on the only flight scheduled on the following day. She told me who to call at jetBlue central, which I did to no avail. Upon our arrival in Nassau, I bought enough clothing to let me visit the beach and eat at restaurants. 28 hours after our arrival, the lost bag was returned. After returning home (on a different airline), I filed a claim for reimbursement from jetBlue for the clothing. It took two weeks of promises, terminated phone calls in the middle of conversations, and way too much of my time to pry my money out of the hands of the penny pinchers at jetBlue. All to pay me what the U.S. Transportation Dept. said they should pay me. Life should be spent on a beach, in the mountains, at a good bar, with your family ... go ahead and join in. But you shouldn't spend an unreasonable amount of time getting an airline to live up to its promises. Bye bye jetBlue.",-1

I booked extra leg room for my son and I months ago, it was about $400 seats/taxes/fees. I receive an email today that they moved our seats. They separated my minor child and I by rows and also put us both in the middle. There are other open extra leg room seats in the emergency row (my son is not legally able to sit there due to age restrictions) and yet they separated a parent who paid for seats together at a higher rate instead of putting adults in the emergency exit seats. I called and sat on hold for almost over 45 mins to be put on hold again to the escalation department just to be told ""we can do that"" and eventually the man in another country hung up on me. The customer service has been trash. I can't believe they'd separate a parent from a kid even with the cost of extra leg room and not move adults elsewhere or at least refund the cost of the seats since the airline moved and separated me from my child. But no, just bad customer service and SOL. I'll never fly Jetblue again. Doesn't matter if you pay for extra leg room, book way in advance, this airline doesn't care.",-1
2024-03-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Ontario via Los Angeles,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1,will never trust Jetblue again,True,"  Missed our connecting flight due to a delay they caused, because they twice changed the times between flights, the last time two hours before it left. When I went to the help desk, I was told the plane came in on time so it was my fault for buying a ticket that didn't leave enough time between flights! Any time there is going to be a delay you could say it came in on time if you change the previous flights departure time to later. They continue to say the plane was on time. It was not according to the schedule that was supposed to have come in over an hour earlier. They charged us $75 EACH to put us on a flight to LAX instead of Ont where we had paid more to go to since we have no way to get home from LAX. That flight to LAX broke down and we ended up waiting 6 hours in all for a new plane to take us to LAX where we didn't want to be in the first place. We got in at 3:30am, and had no way to get home. Finally got an Uber home for over a hundred dollars. Had no food, they gave us vouchers for twelve dollars, but all the stores closed at 10:00, and we were given the voucher at 10:15 PM so there was nothing to eat either, and nothing was offered free on the delayed flight once we got on. It was a nightmare, and all we are offered is a $75 credit for a future Jetblue flight, which will never happen. They keep saying the plane was on time, but only because the flight was changed twice, once at the last minute, then we were told to go to the wrong gate, which was also printed on our ticket. When we ran there the gate had been changed to gate sixteen at the other end of the airport. We made it -just barely, we are in our late 70's and nearly died trying to get there, but although the plane was still there, they would not let us on. They proceeded to charge us $75 each to change the ticket to go to LA where we did not want to go, and shouldn't have had to go if the first flight had left on time. All the agents say is that the plane came in on time and it was our fault for purchasing this flight with not enough time. It was the flight Jetblue gave to our credit card travel to sell to us, and had the times not been changed twice it would have been fine. There is no help or no one who seems to think that this is totally wrong on all counts and we will never trust Jetblue again. Waiting 6 hours in the airport was horrible. No food. Before that we were afraid to leave the area in case they called us to board, which they did do, but after standing on the jetway for 25 minutes they told us to go sit down again because the plane was not ready. Then just to add to the misery, our luggage was at Ont and was only available to be picked up between 9:00pm and eleven pm. We are old and can't drive at night and had no way to get it. This seems absolutely illegal for them to CHARGE us to change a ticket that was their fault for being late. They didn't even try to delay the departing flight for us, even tho there were others who came on our plane that were also stuck. Nor did they have any sense of taking blame for what was obviously their fault, instead blaming US for buying that ticket, the one that they gave our travel agent to sell to us, and then proceeding to twice change the time between flights, which we had no control over. Not to mention the cat that got loose in the plane after we finally took off! OR the trip flight that looked as though we were flying to Russia!",-1

Guess what we get when we get to the gate, a $65 charge for a carry on.. for that price I’ll pack an entire suit case worth of things instead of a carry on. Thanks for the heads up JetBlue. After an hour delay due to the jet not being on time then there was maintenance issues with the jet before boarding. All was was 5 minutes later so we boarded, get on board doors close, ready for push back, nope! Can’t close the cargo door, another maintenance delay. I highly discourage flying JetBlue.",-1
2024-03-10,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Los Angeles,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,4,not be flying this airline again,True,"  Boarding order is the oddest I have experienced on any airline. I had a seat towards the front but was one of the last groups to board so by the time I boarded I could only put my carry on approximately 10 rows behind me which meant I would have to wait for others to deplane before I could retrieve my luggage. While I struggled to find space in the overhead bins, I received no help from the flight attendants for some time before someone finally helped me. This flight was also delayed but I understand that can happen to any airline. The plane also just seems older than other airlines. There was no USB port with each economy seat and the controls seemed older. At least there is free wifi. There was also trash in the seat pocket at my seat which I found unappealing. With this experience, I will not be flying this airline again and would not recommend.",-1

Check-in at their terminal at JFK was easy and quick, as was checking baggage. I was surprised to receive an email that my bag was successfully loaded onto the plane. Terminal 5 is attractive and well-organized, with many good places to eat, shop or just sit and relax. The plane was full and boarding was slow. The plane was very clean, and seating was spacious. Unlike some other airlines flying across the country, the selection of entertainment on JetBlue was excellent, with free movies and free wifi. Snacks were good and beverage service was generous. The flight attendants were caring and professional. Although the flight left almost 30 minutes late, we arrived at our destination only 7 minutes behind schedule. Deplaning was slow. By the time I got to baggage claim, my bag was waiting for me. Overall, a positive experience with JetBlue.",1

Had to leave airport with luggage with nowhere to wait so rented a room to sleep. Rescheduled connecting flight via phone then flight was further delayed making it impossible to make connection a 2nd time. Another hour on the phone to get a flight out of Orlando the next day then flight was moved again forward to a time we could have made the connection. Once we arrived again at the airport the flight was again delayed. Poor explanation and poor notification. Told we could check on arrival to see if a room voucher might be possible.

When I got to the counter I was told I did not need to check my bags because they were small enough to take on the plane. Let the gentleman know the website said we were unable to take bags on, he states that is only bigger bags but that it is not specified on the site. We did not end up checking our bags and took them on the plane with us. The gentleman stated we can call JetBlue and get a refund. I called this morning and was told, too bad no refund. The check in website is very misleading and I did not use the services and now I'm told oh well, you already paid. This is very disappointing and should make people reconsider flying with this airline.",-1

He was very disrespectful toward me. I am traveling because a family member passed away and the last thing I need is for an employee to mock me. The staff used the speaker to let know customers that if you were in group F you needed to go over him, because the carry-on needed to be checked in. I went over and he explained that I needed to pay. I let him know I did not know and I had flown with JetBlue before and I thought the carry-on was free. He proceeds to tell me that I have to pay $65 or upgrade the seat. I asked how much it was to upgrade the seat and he started looking for pricing and responded that the price was $90. I understand that he is doing his job, and I understand that I needed to pay, but why make the additional comments and treat a customer so badly. I would never travel with Jetblue again. Horrible experience. I can not support a company where their employees do not show empathy to their customer.",-1

Our connecting 10pm flight was cancelled so we went to the service desk to figure out lodging for the evening. We were told they were not handing out hotel vouchers, however we would be reimbursed up to $250 per person. They then placed us on standby for the next morning. When returning to the airport the next morning, we had to re-pay our baggage fees and were told our standby position had not been held and we'd lose our spot and be put on standby at the end of the line due to the prior service desk agents errors. Luckily, we were able to make the flight regardless of the lost spot. However, when attempting to be reimbursed for a $120 Uber ride to the closest available lodging and a $400 hotel bill, we were told the flight was not eligible because it had been cancelled due to weather. The flight had been cancelled due to no pilot being available but we were informed that he was delayed due to weather so we were still ineligible for reimbursement despite being told by the service desk we'd be reimbursed. We attempted every method to get reimbursed and were met with incapable, unhelpful agents who simply repeated the same thing and did not care that we were lied to by their agents. Horrible experience and we have not flown JetBlue since and never plan to.",-1
2024-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santiago to New York,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I did not qualify for the credit,True,"  I booked flight 1436 from San Francisco to New York, which was scheduled to arrive at 1:37 PM. However, due to mechanical issues, the flight was delayed until 3:23 AM the next day. I was offered by a JetBlue staff to be assigned to a different flight, flight 1936, which arrived around 8 PM. This means that I arrived more than 6 hours later than my original arrival time. When I spoke to the agent about a credit delay, I was informed that I changed flight and therefore I did not qualify for the credit. I was referred to the JetBlue Customer Service Plan1, which states that customers whose flight is delayed 6 hours or more due to a Controllable Irregularity are entitled to a $200 credit. However, the plan also states that customers who voluntarily change their flight are not eligible for compensation. I find this policy unfair and unethical, as I did not voluntarily change my flight, but accepted the offer that JetBlue made to me in order to avoid further delay and uncertainty. I do not think that I should be penalized for taking the option that JetBlue provided me. I believe that I deserve the same compensation as the customers who stayed on the original flight, as I experienced the same inconvenience and frustration.",-1

I understand how people criticize the airline for delays, and I have had my fair share of delays on jetBlue, but I have never had a bad experience with their customer service. Every jetBlue employee I have interacted with has been nothing short of amazing. In terms of the hard product, the legroom can't be beat and their updated IFE makes sure there's something for everyone. If somehow theres nothing in the IFE for you, the FREE wifi has always been a perk I enjoy, and it was the first airline I can think of that offered this about 6 or 7 years ago. jetBlue has never done me dirty enough to swear off of them, so I plan to keep on flying with them for the foreseeable future.",1

I've been flying with JetBlue for over 10 years, for the first time in those 10 years I had to cancel or at the very least modify my flight to a different date, JetBlue refused any kind of consideration towards waiving the steep cancelation/modification fees, even though I did not request a refund but simply a travel credit for a future date, extremely disappointed in how poorly they would treat a long time customer, especially given their multiple delays (still sore about an 8 hour delay out of Boston this summer for which no compensation was offered) and other service deficiencies as of late.

2023-11-14,0.2,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to New York,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1,the seat was completely broken,True," Purchased a Mint seat (one way) $1,474 + tax (SFO to JFK). Got onto the plane only to find out (in the air) that the seat was completely broken - no recline, bed, functionality at all. I notified the flight attendant, was told to call Jetblue and she would make a note that the seat was broken. Apparently that didn't happen. After multiple correspondence with Jetblue (phone calls & chat), I was issued only a $200 travel credit with no additional ability to contest this. The Operations associate implied that there was no proof because the flight attendant didn't make notes of this issue and this credit was “a courtesy.” The Escalation associate said that in the, “carriage contract, they cannot guarantee your seat works and $200 travel credit is the only thing they can do.” Sad that you can spend that amount of money and you're not guaranteed to get what you paid for. In addition, Jetblue will no longer fly to my local airport (BTV) in less than 2 months, so I would have to spend even more money just to try to use that credit at another airport - it’s pretty much useless to me now. Been a loyal customer of JetBlue’s so I’m very disappointed that they don’t stand by their product and purchasing a Mint seat is risky.",-1

2023-10-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,New York to Orlando,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“experience was nothing short of a nightmare”,False," I am writing to share an appalling experience my family and I had with JetBlue. On the day of our travel, we arrived at the airport at 03:00 with my spouse and two young children. Despite having a booking confirmation and ticket information at hand, the airport personnel couldn’t locate our booking in their system. We were stranded at the airport, with our little ones, for an excruciatingly long time while they pretended to rectify the issue. To our dismay, the solution offered was to send us to another airport for a flight scheduled 5.5 hours later. We were promised a lunch, but upon arrival, were handed mere vouchers of $12 per person, hardly enough for a run to grab a bottle of water. Moreover, despite assurances that we would be seated together on the new flight, we found ourselves scattered throughout the plane, seated at the far end. The sense of security and comfort one seeks while traveling with family was ruthlessly snatched away. Our ordeal didn’t end here. The flight we were transferred to, initially set for 02:30, was further delayed by over two hours, making our departure time 10 hours later than originally scheduled. The indifference and rudeness of the staff added salt to the wounds. Their lack of empathy and sheer disregard for our situation, especially with young children, was glaringly obvious. The experience was nothing short of a nightmare. The lack of professionalism and human decency displayed by JetBlue’s staff was abominable. It’s disheartening to see such a level of indifference towards passengers’ well-being and utter disregard for customer service. This ordeal not only disrupted our plans but also added a layer of stress and discomfort to what was supposed to be a smooth journey. The way we were treated is unacceptable, and I hope no one else has to go through such a horrendous experience.",-1

Unable to think straight and racked with anxiety the two Jetblue staff assisted me to order another Uber which was very hard early in the morning, they rang the hotel and organised the hotel staff to collect the passport from the safe in my hotel room and liaise with the Uber driver to drive it to the airport.

I am absolutely livid at the experience I received and the absolute lack of regard for not only their own policy but their customers. 9/25/23 - We booked a 3 hr flight from Boston to Chicago, scheduled departure time 5.35pm ET (flight B6 811) -The flight is perpetually delayed. Last officially updated delay in the JetBlue app was 9.54pm, 4.5 hours from original scheduled departure. However, despite boarding at this time, the plane sat on the runway until 10.35pm ET, a full five hours after scheduled departure. The reason for the delay, according to the flight's captain, was a mechanical issue with the engine of the original plane we were supposed to take. We ended up switching to a different flight coming in from Orlando, which did not even arrive until 8.45pm. 9/26/23 - We arrive at O'Hare around 1:30am, ET/12.30AM CT. As soon as I arrive at my destination I contact JetBlue's chat line requesting a travel credit given the delay. The woman I spoke with me assured me a credit would be issued once the flight was reviewed. - Per Jetblue's official policy, flights delayed by 3 hours are issued a $50 travel credit and an additional $50 is added per extra hour delayed up to $200. Given that this flight was delayed by five hours until take-off, proper compensation should have been $150. Even if going by the last official time of departure, 4.5 hours late, it should have been $100. - Instead, I wake up that morning to find I only received a $50 travel credit. - I use JetBlue's chat support line again to request additional compensation to reconcile the discrepancy between what I was given and what I was owed given JetBlue's own policy and the length of the delay. - Ginette tells me the flight was delayed by only 3.5 hours according to the investigation log and that she is unable to provide further compensation. When I ask why the investigation log is inaccurate and send the screenshot from the JetBlue app showing that the last updated time of departure is over 4 hours after original scheduled time, she simply repeats like a broken clock and tells me there is nothing she can do. - I ask to speak to a supervisor, to which she tells me that she is a supervisor. I ask to speak to her supervisor, and am transferred back to Ginette. She then tells me I will need to call JetBlue's line and request a supervisor. Ok fine. - So, after very little sleep on account of this delay, I call JetBlue's customer service line where I am transferred to the escalation team. - I speak to Jonathan on the escalation team who tells me essentially the same thing, the flight was delayed by 3 hours, there was no delay code in the flight, and their ops team has already reviewed the flight and determined it is only eligible for $50. When I asked why the flight says it was only delayed on their end by 3 hours when it actuality it was far longer, I am told he doesn't know and can only go by what he is told on his end. - Here I am now with only a $50 credit on a flight that should have received at least $100, if not $150. I am absolutely baffled as to why a company as large and as profitous as JetBlue would refuse to honor their own policy and extending an additional $100 credit towards customers who were delayed by five whole hours except for an all consuming avarice and absolute soulless apathy towards the paying customers who give JetBlue its revenue in the first place. I am furious at my treatment from this airline.",-1

Get in the flight, not able to get AC then after 15mins we had to get out of the plane due to a fuel tank problem. They were unable to find a plane in replacement, had to wait many hours at the gate without any compensation. I recommend you to avoid this company, they shouldn’t be able to be a company.",-1
2023-09-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,they wanted us to buy a new flight,True,"  JetBlue doesn’t seem to mind jettisoning their cancelled fliers into the abyss the “Help” desk. (if they haven’t actually closed it down after you and 199+ passengers have been seated on a plane for 7 hours on the tarmac and then JB cancels and deplanes all passengers ). The freshly trained “help” crew just stare at the screens and can’t find you anything so just go sit and wait. Our janitors will sweep you up if we find you wilted and neglected in a corner on the floor. They should call it “No notice “ “No Help” Too Bad, So Sad airlines. We don’t notice how inept we are, we don’t notice you either. But we’re damned grateful you are so patient. Because, what is that motto we have plastered everywhere in our jolly blue lobbies? “We love to help. Helping’s our favorite”. Their favorite way of helping is to give you a boarding pass that has not been registered so when you are at the gate to board with a ticket in hand, they tell you they can’t find your res and close the flight door, or, get you another res and cancel it 2 hours before you fly. No stress there? 9/9/23 boarded flight 3:30pm from jfk to sfo. Taxied out for an hour, ultimately sat on plane, taxiing in and out twice, for 7 hours, then after profusely thanking us for our good behavior and unending patience, deplaned us all. The gate agent assured us that within 3 more hours we would get an email informing us of our replacement flights. We all understood that weather in the west was causing a great deal of problems. We did understand what a shit show this was going to be for everyone including JetBlue. No such email came, ever. All that came was an email informing us that the flight was cancelled with a link to “manage your flight” that sent the user around in circles or telling them they weren’t eligible, or weren’t covered or whatever. Phone calls had a wait time of 547 minutes, text links 2 hours. If one tried to reserve on this link, by the time all info was entered, the flight was unavailable. “Help “ desk was empty, no agents anywhere. Airport was closed for business in JetBlue terminal. Oh, by the way, you can’t leave this terminal area or you won’t get back in because your flight is cancelled and you will have no boarding pass to go anywhere, anytime, got that? So stick around so you don’t miss some phantom flight. A group of us heard that a “crew” was coming in to the help desk at 4am. At 4:15 am, 3 young freshly trained folks came out to man the long “help” counter because “helping” is their favorite thing to do. As a group 15 + of us had pulled up chairs to sit in because we could hardly stand any longer, having had no sleep or food, a JetBlue supervisor told us we couldn’t sit there, it was a safety hazard. Fainting in the aisle from exhaustion is not a safety hazard? Some of these people were 70 - 80 + in age, and we ultimately stood in line 3 1/2 hours. It was impossible to “manage” any flights with JetBlue through the link they gave us, basically they wanted us to buy a new flight that, if you got that far, required you to buy a seat in addition to the ticket, seats and tickets where the prices were rising as one scrolled the pages as if they were in live auction. Even if you tried to buy a ticket at inflated prices, by the time one entered all required info, when you pressed the “buy” button, the response was “sorry, we sold your seat”. Hey, we can make some serious bucks off of these nice patient folks!",-1

I bought my flight precisely for the arrival time at my destination in Punta Cana which would be 10.30 am, this way I could make better use of my vacation days, however, my flight was scheduled to leave Boston at 6.35 am on 01/09/2023 and arrive in Punta Cana at 10.30 am, but JetBlue only said it was late, we waited a long time, until we boarded, we spent almost an hour on the plane before we got off again and waited a long time for another boarding, at the end of it all I only arrived at my destination, it was already past 6 pm, I lost an entire day of my vacation. Day of my return which was 08/09/2023 from Punta Cana to Boston with a stop in NY and arrival in Boston, such was my surprise when I arrived in NY the flight that was to leave for Boston at 10.50 pm was cancelled, the staff giving vague answers, they said that our flight to Boston would only leave the next day at the same time, that if we wanted we would have to wait more than 24 hours and that JetBlue would not pay for the hotel, I saw many people indignant, without answers, with much insistence they put me on a flight at 3 am, to get to Boston, when I arrived in Boston my suitcase didn't come, after a lot of searching for information they said they would deliver it to my house, 2 days later. Avoid this company, because if you have problems they are totally uneducated to solve problems, I hope I never have to fly with JetBlue",-1
2023-09-10,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,United States to India via London,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,have never seen such level of incompetence,False,"  My elderly parents booked this airlines to fly from the US to India and had a horrible experience. Firstly their flight was delayed multiple times through out the day so my aged parents were stuck from morning 3.00 am in the morning till 9.00 pm. Because of the delay my parents couldn’t make it to their connection flight. Finally when the crew rescheduled they had only less than 2 hours to transit at the Heathrow airport. When I called the customer support to request for a rebook, the supervisor yelled at me. When I raised my concern’s regarding the transit yet again I was met with least concern over their age or even any solution. Despite sharing the fact that my parents have some hearing issues as well so they might need more time in transit, the agent was least concerned about it and was growingly impatient. I have never seen such level of incompetence or lack of concern for customers. I expected a little empathy from those in service industry but seems like they don’t care. I have never seen such level of incompetence or lack of concern for customers. Please don’t be a customer of the airlines.",-1
2023-09-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montego Bay to Newark,4.0,,1.0,,,4.0,2,no longer want to travel JetBlue,True,"  My elderly parents and 16-year-old daughter went to Jamaica for my uncle’s funeral. Our flight was delayed multiple times. We were finally scheduled to depart at 7:07pm, boarded to staff who appeared less than enthused with their jobs. We eventually began taxiing the runway, however, due to a drunk passenger we had to return to the gate. After the intoxicated passenger and family were removed, the captain advised us that the runway closed at 8p.m. and we would be placed in hotels overnight. The passengers were upset and began to complain about this situation, some had work the next day including myself and other responsibilities. Adults would stay at The Riu Montego Bay and families with children under 18 would stay at the Riu Negril which is approximately 1 hour 15 mins without traffic. We arrived at the hotel at 11:50 p.m. to 1 person checking in customers. This process took 2 hours. The following day we boarded an earlier return flight with unfortunately the same crew. As we boarded the flight, I heard an FA say, “did you just roll your eyes at me” and my 16-year-old daughter response was yes. I turned around and my daughter said I gave her side eye. The customers began telling the FA that she’s unprofessional arguing with a minor giving her a look she did not like. The FA stormed to the front of the plane stating that she planned on “kicking someone else of the flight today”. The passengers could not believe this and began complaining that the FA should be removed from the flight.  No other staff approached me to inquire what occurred. I no longer want to travel JetBlue.",-1

On our way back to Boston for our flight home, 4 hours from our scheduled flight, we get an automated phone call that our flight was cancelled. I call customer service and am told there are no flights with Jet Blue to Tampa, Sarasota, or Orlando in the next few days. We had no choice but to accept a refund and book a more expensive flight through another airline the following day. Both the customer service line and a JetBlue supervisor at the airport assured us that they would reimburse us for our hotel and would reach out to us within a week to ask for our receipts. We booked the cheapest option within 30 minutes of the airport, which was over $300/night. Weeks go by, and we never hear from JetBlue. I finally call and am told to submit a request through their website. 2 weeks later, I receive an email from JetBlue basically telling me no payment will be made. This whole ordeal cost us $600 between the hotel, booking another flight, and keeping the rental car for an extra day. JetBlue’s assurances mean nothing! Last time I will ever fly this airline!",-1

JetBlue stated she’s only entitled to an E-ticket and not a full refund. I advised them she will no longer be flying and she had a major stroke. I spoke with a representative last week who advised if I sent in supporting documents that she would be entitled to a full refund. I had the case manager type a letter and I submitted it via the email that was sent prior to attach the documents. I called today to ensure they received and spoke with two escalation representatives who stated unfortunately she’s only entitled to a refund.  The worst airline ever.,-1

Upon arrival in FLL we had wait 2hrs in line with 300 others who were canceled to get new flight info. 2 Agents at counter. While in gate area 3 agents sitting at an info booth no one there! How about send two out to help with brewing disaster at cancelations? So after 3hrs we have new flight for next day. Without care in world that two RDU flights on other airlines had departed while waiting. Next day now another full check in and guess what? Flight delayed! Finally 35min late we are finally on way home. A whole lost day of travel, food expenses etc. This is same thing that happened to us 18 months ago. Same flights!  How can Jetblue keep that flight slot(flt2626). It performance is abysmal after I looked it up. So did any agent care at any point?  Not one apology. No Travel Credits. Nothing. After two times. And we are JB travel members. No email responses from anyone. No one cares one bit about customer. Would really put them out I guess to treat paying customers correctly . So no more Jetblue.  No more Jetblue card. Move on. I do know they deserve merger with Spirit as they are now one in the same!",-1

Very nice seats, friendly service, and a non-alcoholic drink and snack for a 2.5 hour flight. DCA-FLL RT. Check-In staff were very nice about the baggage allowance in that they helped tag the bags when they saw we had trouble. My Boogie Board was on the cusp of their size requirements but they checked it without fuss. I had to shuffle around some weight in one of my bags to get under the generous 50 lb limit. Internet loaded but was effectively unusable for me on social media but the entertainment options were vast so it didn't matter. Seat size was generous and comfortable and everything clean. We got seated together for free in advance because we have a 7 year old. My family always has a great time flying this route for the past 15 years. Will ding 1 star for problems with the internet, but otherwise a near perfect economy RT flight.",1
2023-08-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Boston,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,won’t fly JetBlue ever again,False," You cannot force people to pay to check their bags and not have people available to actually check the bags. We discovered at check in that our fare did not include a carry on bag adding $150 to our overall fare (slick bait and switch JetBlue). So we arrived early expecting a line to check our bags, only to learn they only man the desk between certain hours. We had to wait in the lobby of the airport for over an hour to check our bags. Companies call this lean staffing in the name of reduced pricing, but really what it is is a way to sneakily cut services while charging the consumer a higher rate through hidden fees. With the unanticipated baggage fees the price of this trip was the same as all the competitors but with drastically reduced service and significant frustration. I won’t fly JetBlue ever again.",-1

I didn't have high hopes but was pleasantly surprised. Jet Blue use the newly renovated Terminal B at LaGuardia which was easy to navigate and had some great seating areas as well as shops and restaurants. The plane itself wasn't in the best shape and the seats were covered in a cheap looking plastic material that reminded me of a taxi. However, the flight crew were attentive and gave out free snacks and drinks throughout the flight. The on-board TV screens were great for a short flight and we arrived with no fuss into Orlando well ahead of schedule. For the price paid I couldn't find any fault with Jet Blue.",1
2023-08-17,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Buffalo,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,Dismal service by Jetblue,False,"  I am currently in the middle of the was the worst travel delay I have ever experienced (12 hours and counting). I am being optimistic that we will leave in the next couple of hours - otherwise I'd give one star. I was supposed to leave Orlando on flight 1586 at 4:10PM Aug 16th. It is now 3:11AM on the 17th and I have no idea when we are leaving. We boarded around 8PM the 16th and deplaned ~10PM to a mostly empty airport. Around 11PM we were told we'd leave at 2:30AM, and at 2:15AM we were told the flight wouldn't be leaving. There has been very minimal Jetblue staff at the airport to answer questions. Those staff that were here had to deal with numerous frustrated customers. We were told to go to the Jetblue desk to change flights or get more information, and guess what? No one was there! In addition, there has been no food available in the airport since 10PM. Jetblue should have brought dinner food to the gate. Cheezits do not cut it. This has been a horrible experience, and I will do my best to never fly Jetblue again. As of now, they told us we'd be leaving around 4:30AM. But why should anyone trust that? There must be something you can do to get me back as a customer. How about a refund? I assume I will make it to my destination in the next 24 hours. The lack of staff and information (and food) has been dismal, and I know I am not the only one who feels this way. I see multiple families with children and I know they are very frustrated. How can Jetblue survive in the industry with service like this? I am clicking the box ""I'm traveling within 48 hours"" in hopes that I'll be at my destination by then (it's been over 12 hours in the Orlando airport, and 12 hours since I had any real food. Dismal service by Jetblue.",-1

My flight home was canceled after 3hrs and they wouldn't book me a returning flight until 2 days later (I was flying with a child to boot). I ended up spending extra money to fly home with another airline and got home a day late. My flight has not been refunded after significant amount of effort. They say it has, but no refund has ever been issued. They frequently put me on hold and leave me there until I hang up or tell me information that erroneous and different with each call.

2023-08-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montego bay to newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Avoid Jetblue at all costs,False,"  Avoid Jetblue at all costs. I was traveling with a 2 year old. Before heading out to the airport found out the flight was going to be delayed by at least 3 hours which would get to my destination way past midnight. The only option available for help was to chat via text on WhatsApp. After waiting for half hour, requested the agent to switch the flight for the following day which would get to my destination at a decent hour. The option the agent offered for next day was to an airport 50 miles away from where I left with an arrival time 12:15 AM, past midnight. She just didn’t get it. So, with lot of trepidation decided to go to the airport to catch the original delayed flight. Get to the airport after traveling for 1.5 h, only to hear the announcement at the gate that flight has been canceled and rescheduled to following day. No act of god was involved for the delay. At the last minute scrambled to get a hotel, mind you this was an international trip (Jamaica). How is JetBlue even allowed to operate?",-1
2023-08-14,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Guayaquil to New York,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,stranded me in South America,False,"  JetBlue stranded me in South America. Return midnight flight from Guayaquil, Ecuador to JFK, NY and plane never shows up. First email says flight is delayed until 3am, then next email at 5am says flight is cancelled due to bad weather. They offer no solutions to get out of the country except that they will inform you by email later what to do when they reschedule you. The weather excuse is bogus. They use weather as the excuse in order not to pay compensation. Do not believe the compensation rights email you get from them. I ended up having to book a flight at the airport with Copa Airlines that took me GYE-PTY-EWR (New Jersey), then bus to NYC because I had to work the next day. Although I use this airline frequently because of the routes and seat comfort, I am always tentative to do a return trip without a disruption, and their flight cancellations have been more frequent lately, stranding passengers all over the place. My son just got his domestic return flight to NY cancelled by Jetblue as well. They have a more serious issue that they are not disclosing.",-1

This was our first Jetblue flight so didn't think the worst. We got there without any issue but coming back was an overall stressful experience. Our 2pm flight was delayed since 8am that morning and kept on getting delayed. Because we needed to work the next day we needed to find another flight. Jetblue had nothing available within the earlier flight nor the later flight. We had to book a Delta ticket that was 3x the charge of Jetblue, which totalled $1,500 which had a 6 hour layover in Atlanta but it was the only way to get home prior to clocking in. Jetblue flight actually got delayed until 6am the next morning and we were happy that we thought to book another airline but now have to eat the additional cost. On top of that, they did not refund our plane ticket as promised and claim that they did. They said that there is nothing they can do about it and told me to check with the bank who also does not see anything pending. I am now $2,000 in the hole because of Jetblue and I only got a 400 airline credit. This is not how you make a customer happy. All I want is for them to make it right.

We knew we were going to miss connecting flight in NYC so we had to rebook in Bermuda. Due to a system error, they could not rebook our family of 3 and it was only our family they could not process. All other passengers were checking in their bags and proceeded through customs. We stood in front of check out counter from 11:15 to 8:15 while the jetblue agent was on the phone trying to fix the problem with a customer service agent. At 4:00 customs closed and we were stuck in Bermuda for another 4 hours just trying to have the agent book a flight out for whatever flight we could get. We kept missing opportunities to get on a flight because agent could not book due to their data base crash. Our family of 3 were separated and we all flew on different flights just to get back to Atlanta. JetBlue hesitated to put us up in Bermuda and then they said they had an agreement with a local resort who did not want to honor what jetblue said they approved. My card was charged over 1600 USD for a 2 night stay that I neither wanted not approved. Their was no concern on getting us home or following through with comping the stay. I assumed when I got back home the notes would show the nightmare that we experienced but the Bermudian agents did not put any notes and it just looked like we were just booked on the next available flight. This was 100% a jetblue error and now they are telling me that it is not covered. I am shocked, dismayed and not sure what to do.  I understand delayed and cancelled flights as this happens all of the time but BEWARE as Jet Blue will lie and not honor their contract.",-1

I booked a one way ticket with JetBlue Always from Newark to Los Angeles on 7/06/23, the travel date was 7/27/23, I checked in on 7/26/23. On the morning of 7/28/23, I received a cancellation notice from JetBlue (see attached Cancellation Notice). Problem 1. I was ok with the cancellation, anything could happen, I understood, as long as I could get a refund. About 30 minutes later, I received a rescheduled itinerary, JetBlue unilaterally set the departure at Westchester Airport which is 2 hours away from my home, the flight would take me to Orlando, the layover time would be 8 hours, then from Orlando to Los Angeles, the total travel time would be about 16 hours. Problem 2. It was still ok to me because JetBlue allowed me to cancel it for free. The instructions led me to ""Manage trip"". I followed the instructions but kept receiving error messages, so the refund couldn't be processed. Problem 3. It suggested ""Chat"" would be the fastest way to solve the problems/issues, or for Q&A. But ""Chat"" couldn't solve my problem, it led me back to ""Manage trip"" again and again, and couldn't do anything for me. Problem 4. I had no choice but to call JetBlue, the holding time to reach a live person was 1.5 hours, finally a real person picked up my line, the first sentence was to let me know that the refund request placed on the phone was subject to $25. Well, I started to get aggravated. Anyway, the refund request was sent in and the $25 fee was waived. Problem 5. Finally I received the refund with $30 short. The interesting part was the refund amount on the statement was correct, but the actual amount was $30 less (see attached). So I had to call Jetblue again, the representative told me after investigation it was their mistake when processing the refund. Well, JetBlue used to be my favorite airline, I don't know why it changed so much in a bad way, I believe I am not the only one having these problems. I am sharing this experience with the public, hope JetBlue wakes up someday, and improves the quality of service.",-1

JetBlue's next available flight was 4 days later. It rained for 10 minutes that day and they just don't have the resources to accommodate the delays or cancellations coming from other parts of the country. It has been more than 10 business days and still have not received refund and incurred additional costs at $843 above what credit they are giving back. Wait times when trying to call the airline were 5 hours. Will not fly with them again.,-1

2023-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Syracuse,3.0,,4.0,,1.0,3.0,1,never again will I be using Jetblue,False," Our flight was delayed which made me miss the next flight after which was ridiculous. I had to wait 8 hours for the next flight only for it to take me to Queen's and then to my destination instead of straight there which would only had been an hour but now it will be 3. So that's about 10-11 hours it took to get home in which stressed me out so much, especially since I'm pregnant, and they only gave me a voucher for $12 in food which did nothing since everything here cost more that ten? It was an ridiculous experience, and never again will I be using Jetblue. They seem very unorganized. Not the first flight I've seen to miss their next flight either. I am very stressed out and tired. They even changed the number without notice, so many people are missing their flights it's disgusting.",-1
2023-07-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to New York,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Canceled my flight 5 hours before departure,True," Worst airline. Canceled my flight 5 hours before departure.

2023-07-30,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to San Juan,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,customers pay ridiculous prices,False,"  Flight delay, very rough landing, ran out of most food (even items available for purchase), no Wifi, no in-flight entertainment. When I contacted customer service (at a flight attendant's urging) I was told that I should just bring my own snacks and download a movie before I fly. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful, but seemed embarrassed by the conditions on the plane. To sum up, on JetBlue, customers pay ridiculous prices and are then asked to bring their own food, bring their own entertainment, pay extra for traveling with carry-on luggage, pay extra for the privilege of sitting with their family members, and then have to deal with snarky customer service reps. I know JetBlue doesn't need my business, but they don't have to flaunt it.",-1
2023-07-29,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Jose to New York JFK,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,nothing short of a nightmare,True,"  My recent encounter with JetBlue Airways was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, this trip was plagued with delays, cancellations, and an utter lack of care for their customers. It all began with a 2-hour delay on our flight from JFC airport to San Jose. Although delays can happen, the lack of communication and transparency from JetBlue's staff made the situation incredibly frustrating and stressful for all passengers involved. The real ordeal began on our return flight from San Jose to JFK airport, which JetBlue unceremoniously canceled without any prior warning. The alternative they offered was to reschedule us on a flight departing from San Francisco airport, which is about a 1-hour drive away from our intended destination! It's hard to fathom how an airline can think it's acceptable to make such a drastic change without taking into account the inconvenience it causes passengers. To add insult to injury, JetBlue's lack of responsibility and concern for their customers became evident when they refused to provide any compensation for the additional expenses incurred due to their own incompetence. They did not offer any hotel accommodations for the unexpected overnight stay in San Francisco, forcing us to bear the cost ourselves. Additionally, they showed no willingness to arrange for transportation to the San Francisco airport, leaving us stranded and helpless. As if the frustration wasn't enough, their customer service was an absolute disaster. Attempting to contact them by phone was an exercise in futility, as the waiting time to speak to a representative was a staggering 1 hour! Similarly, the wait time for their chat support was an outrageous 1 hour and 30 minutes! It's evident that JetBlue lacks the capacity or desire to address the grievances of their customers promptly. Throughout this entire ordeal, the staff's attitude displayed a disheartening lack of empathy and understanding. It felt as if they considered us mere inconveniences rather than valued patrons who deserved respect and consideration. In conclusion, my experience with JetBlue Airlines was beyond disappointing. The delays, cancellations, and subsequent lack of support and compensation have left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I strongly advise against choosing JetBlue for your travel needs unless you're willing to endure a series of unfortunate events and an indifferent customer service team. There are plenty of other airlines that prioritize their passengers and go the extra mile to ensure a smooth and pleasant journey. JetBlue has shown a complete disregard for their customers' well-being, and I will certainly not be entrusting them with my business in the future.",-1

No compensation for flight both delayed over 5 hours! Representative gave so many excuses until the denied any sort of compensation for a family of four with small children stranded in the airport. Inflight was also terrible no service of any sort tv service not working. We travel a lot and this was the worst experience ever. Never again!,-1
2023-07-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to New York,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1,flight time has changed 10 times,True," Do not ever ever ever EVER EVER EVER fly Jet Blue unless you’re into masochism or just don’t want to ever go back home. This is my 3rd time flying with Jet Blue and this is the 3rd time I’ve experience incompetence with them. Our flight is delayed because of some mysterious storm that I can’t seem to find anywhere on the radar. We were supposed to fly out 9PM last night and it’s currently 12:41 PM 7/22/23. The flight time has changed around 10 times now and was just delayed again to 1:30PM today. I TOLD my boyfriend not to fly with them again, but No. The last time we flew with them, the pilot never even showed up for work and they had to bring a pilot from another airport. Now this flight has been delayed “due to weather” (which is all they can say) and late last night they changed the time to 3 AM from 12:30 PM. If this is due to weather, how can you just push the time up roughly 9 hours? And then push it to 1:30 pm, and then 12:30 and then 1:30 again? This is by far the worst airline in the world and they have THE NERVE to try to buy another airline. Get your business in order first before you try ruining Spirit Airlines (which I assume HAS to be 500x better than this trash airline). At least this time it wasn’t 10 degrees on the flight, though the Wi-Fi didn’t work. There were no apologies or anything. Also, every flight from every other airline that was heading to New York from San Francisco (which is very close to San Jose, you can see that airport when you’re taking off) that night we’re all fly out on time, no delays or anything. There was no bad weather or anything. Just JetBlue lying to keep from having to give refunds or something to everybody.",-1

2023-07-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Tampa,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never book JetBlue again,True,  Third time flying to Boston from Tampa this year for healthcare reasons for my dad. I have flown Jet Blue since 2005. I loved them for years and probably have seventy five flights with them. I will never book JetBlue again. The last few trips have been maintenance problems with the plane. My trip on July 23rd to Tampa is delayed from 10:18 to 2:40 as they are waiting for a plane from the Dominican republic to arrive. A four hour delay is now common on Jet Blue flights along with cancelations. The email they sent me says it is a 22hr flight to Tampa and the help desk doesn't know why it says that so you have to literally go to the help desk to get information. I am sixty years old and have flown my whole life. They have turned into the worst airline in the United States.,-1
2023-07-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The customer service is horrible,False,  Jetblue doesn't cancel flights they push them back and make you waste time and money at the airport to then cancel flights. If there's a safety issue it's better to cancel a flight. I was leaving Saturday evening and my plane never left so I tried a different day and the flight was delayed again. I tried a new flight and it's delayed as well. There should be a policy that if a flight is delayed for than three times that it should be canceled. The customer service is horrible in the Santo Domingo airport in Jetblue. You can wait on a line for an hour or more and they don't help anyone or communicate what's happening to the plane. The Jetblue workers in Santo Domingo have attitudes and don't wanna do their job. Jetblue will delay everything and not compensate you when you lose days of work. Jetblue only wants money and they don't provide the service that they say online.,-1

With that knowledge I booked with another airline for the next day. After my booking I received and email from Jetblue that I was booked on another flight the next day. There was no mention of this in the email cancelling my flight. Now its to late to get a refund. In all my years I have never had this happen. Be very careful with dealing with this airline. I will certainly think twice before booking with them in the future!,-1

JetBlue did not have an aircraft at the gate for a 9:41 flight to Punta Cana. However they knew the feeder flight was going to be 5 hours late. Substituted a plane for a boarding time at 1:15pm. Kept us on plane for 2 hours while they scrambled for available pilots. Still on plane at 5:38 pm with little to no communication. Finally let passengers get off the plane to be berated by counter staff! I have flown JetBlue many times but this will be my last! Understaffed!,-1
2023-07-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,we are stranded in another state,True," Before our flight, we saw in the news that over 1,500 other JetBlue flights were canceled. Still went to our flight (because we had no other choice), waiting 4 hours from 8 in the evening to midnight, only to have police come over to tell us our flight was canceled. Turns out, it wasn't just ours; on the board of flights, over 15 other flights were heavily delayed and canceled. We were all told at once about the cancelation, so we all ran against one another to get in line first, which has barely moved as I write this (over an hour wait now). There was an automatic rebooking, which would take us up to New York (which is being hit by heavy storms), then back down to Florida, then finally to California which makes 0 sense. Employees have said all their hotels are booked and no direct flights can come until 2 days, so overall we are stranded in another state with nothing and no compensation. Way to go JetBlue, never flying here again and neither should you.",-1

Once on board the flight attendant or the pilot told us the repair of a broken flight attendant seat took longer than expected. All of this after trying to find another flight after canceling my flight after midnight. I happened to look at my phone for the time at 12:15 and saw they cancelled the flight. I spent the next six hours waiting for a human being to book us on a flight from a different airport. Beyond disgusted with the lack of care shown by the airline and the employees. Very little done to convince me to fly with them again. No longer do they go the extra mile. The app is useless. The website is useless. “Oops try again. We are unable to complete your request at this time.” The return flight is now scheduled for 12:42 AM and totally doesn’t sync with connecting flight in Boston. Their attitude is “Oh well.” I totally feel unwanted by this airline. Not that anyone from Jetblue would read this. They are flailing and failing. I’d rate them a ZERO if I could.,-1

2023-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Miami,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,This is simply a money grab,False,"  1) We flew MIA to Newark and they didn't put our 2 children's car seats on the flight. Both tagged and handed over with the luggage. They were not able to get them to us. Our children are 3 and 4 and the customer service response is ""your problem"" 2) Flight from NYC to MIA on Friday is canceled. Jetblue provided no information and I mean none at all. Unaware if they are rebooking or refunding. Call wait times are long. 3) They can't reebok from New York Airport. They can get us on a flight from DC to Fort Lauderdale, so we get to DC. They cancel that flight and rebook us from DC going to West Palm. Even though they are still selling flights from DC to FLL and had enough space to book all 4 of us for any of the FLL flights. We find this out as we arrive to the airport. We were notified via voice message 4hrs later. After 2hrs wait to speak to an agent we were told they ""can send us to any South Florida airport they want"" and other passengers (even those without tickets previously) have priority. This is simply a money grab so they can continue selling flights and fill up the low demand flights to other locations. Arriving into West Palm, 70+ miles from our airport, at 9pm, with 2 small children after 72hrs of traveling is acceptable to Jetblue and a true representation of how little they value their customers. We have submitted a refund and rebooked with American, and will never make the mistake of booking Jetblue again their processes are not customer centric.",-1

Prepare yourself for a mind-boggling level of disorganization and sheer incompetence. They take delay torment to a whole new level, making you suffer through agonizing 6-hour delays with zero explanation. And as if that's not enough, they have the audacity to charge you a ridiculous $25 fee just to attempt to reach their so-called customer service phone line, only to have them hang up on you without a care in the world. Picture this: you're already subjected to a mind-numbing 6-hour delay, and on top of that, they have the gall to demand $25 from you for the privilege of contacting them.",-1
2023-07-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Montego Bay,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,spent in hours of disarray,False," Our honeymoon was spent in hours of disarray! The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life. Our flight was delayed, and we missed our connecting flight. As if that wasn’t stressful enough. I was laughed at, told to get over it, and the “supervisor” spoke as though she was in high school. Making rude faces, throwing her hands up saying not my problem, and doing absolutely zero to make the situation better. I will NEVER fly jet blue again. I had a man yell at me to look at his hand as he’s giving me directions, and I was looking at his hand and where he was pointing. I’m honestly not even upset about my flight. The lack of communication, and level of unprofessional behavior from every single member of that team on July 14th 2023. Solidified my feelings that I would rather never fly again, then fly JetBlue.",-1
2023-07-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Atlanta to Boston,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,incompetence laughably pathetic,True," JetBlue’s operational incompetence is laughably (not really funny) pathetic. After a 2 hour delay (the 4th multi hour delay I have had this month on this airline), at the designated boarding time, the gate attendant informs us that “our plan had to be diverted to Charlotte because of storms.” Setting aside whether or not the stated reason is true, why would it take until boarding time for JetBlue to reveal that the plane is in another city. Zero authenticity. Zero trustworthiness. This airline is operationally incompetent. Take this airline if you relish getting massively delayed every time you fly and enjoy getting jerked around about how long the delay will be.",-1

I purchased a ticket that's cost met $187 that turned into travel credits after I canceled my trip. Now I am trying to rebook my trip but I am told I only can use my credit for the ticket and not for the extra bag or seat, while I still have extra credit balance available. They won't return my money to my credit card and they won't allow me to use it to pay my extra luggage. This sounds like cheap low level type of service just as Spirit Airlines.

2023-07-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Los Angeles,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,1,never travel with JetBlue again,True,"  Thanks to Jet Blue for the worst travel experience my family and I have ever had. Our flight was supposed to be about 2 1/2 hours from Seattle to LAX. After arriving at our gate we learned that our flight had been delayed by 2 hours. Ok, no big deal. Then another 2 hours, and then again and again. Our flight was delayed for more than 10 hours. After speaking to the gate agent 2 different times, we, and everyone else were told the plane had a mechanical issue and would arrive asap. Everyone was also told they would be issued a $200 credit for the delay per Jet Blue policy. The gate agent said we would receive an email regarding this credit. Nobody was happy about the delay, but at least we would be compensated, or so we thought. After several days without an email about the credit we were promised I called Jet Blue customer service. I was told that we were not entitled to any compensation because our 10 hour delay was weather related. How convenient. Their compensation policy doesn't cover weather delays. I already knew weather delays weren't covered after reading their policy during our delay. I asked where the plane was coming from and they said LAX. What weather delays does LAX have in July? I explained to them that a result of this delay my family lost an entire day of our vacation and lost our car rental since we arrived after hours. Why do Jet Blue gate agents tell us all it was a mechanical issue with the plane (covered under their compensation policy) and promise everyone compensation, then Jet Blue doesn't follow through? Sounds like a bait and switch. Customer service offered us a $75 credit to each of us as a ""courtesy"". I declined the credit because this isn't about a dollar amount for me. This is about a company following through with what it promises its customers. After sharing this story with a friend, they explained that they had a similar experience with Jet Blue. Maybe its Jet Blues policy to lie to its customers. As a result of this, my family will never travel with JetBlue again. I would rather pay more to fly with a different airline than to give them our business again.",-1

2023-07-10,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Atlanta via Florida,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,misguided by the JetBlue agent,True," I bought a JetBlue return ticket with 50 lbs of check-in baggage to travel from Atlanta and Boston from June 05 to June 10, 2023. I faced three main problems: 1) After a few days of booking, I was informed by JetBlue that my direct flight had been canceled. They also assigned me a new flight which was several hours earlier than my actual departure time from Boston. I contacted the JetBlue helpline and requested to book another flight (the only option for June 10), which wasn’t direct (rather Boston to Florida to Atlanta). 2) During the online boarding process on June 05 and 10, I had to choose a check-in baggage option and was informed that my credit card would not be charged if I had already paid for check-in baggage. I followed the same process on my return flight from Boston to Atlanta. But my credit card was charged $35 for my Atlanta to Boston trip. After a few days, when I looked at my credit card summary, I contacted JetBlue for a refund. They said they would process my request in the next ten days. But contacting JetBlue support was a very frustrating process: wait time was 45 minutes, and it took me over an hour to report the matter to a JetBlue crewmember. 3) The most important and frustrating thing I experienced on June 10 when returning from Boston to Atlanta. The good thing was that JetBlue informed me that I must leave early for the airport because there was some construction work going on in Boston City; therefore, commuting to Boston airport may take longer than usual. My flight was scheduled for 3:45 PM. Therefore, I left for the airport at 12:00 PM. But when I reached the airport, I learned that the departure was delayed for around 35 minutes. The flight kept on delaying, and finally, I learned that I would not be able to catch my 2nd JetBlue flight from Florida to Atlanta if I flew by the original flight from Boston to Florida. I approached the JetBlue helpdesk at Boston Airport. After more than 90 minutes of waiting, I talked to the help desk official. He issued me a new direct ticket (Boston to Atlanta) for the next day. Upon asking, they informed me that I could book a hotel for up to $250. I booked a hotel for an overnight stay in Boston and spent around $240 (I didn’t eat dinner). Then I contacted JetBlue and sent them the invoice. After ten days, I was informed by JetBlue that I was not eligible for reimbursement because the flight was delayed due to the weather. Why was I misguided by the JetBlue agent that I was entitled to a $250 hotel? As a graduate student, $250 is a huge amount for me.",-1

I tried to contact them because in the website it says they provide food voucher and hotel in case of cancellation due to controllable reason but they said the cancellation happened because of the weather, so there was nothing they could do besides rescheduling my flight. The next available flight was 2 days later, so I had to find somewhere to stay on short notice, spend a money that I couldn’t (my hotel reservations for the previous days were a gift). Also, my husband and I missed 2 days of work, and we won’t get paid for these days. I had to pay someone to petsit my cat since I had paid her only for the amount of days I thought we would need. The customer service was ridiculous, he seemed so used to dealing with this situation that he seemed to not care at all.

In July 22 I was bumped and now exactly a year later they cancelled my July 9 flight two hours before takeoff when I had already paid $150 for a car service. They said they’d email a new flight. They didn’t. They removed the flight from my app so I couldn’t manage it. I finally got on a new flight on July 12 (3 days later) after spending literally 4 hours trying to reschedule and losing money for a hotel and time share points. In addition I had to pay a car service to get home. Then they sent an email saying the cancellation was out of their control and they didn’t have to reimburse any of my expenses. Friends told me not to use them. I used to love them. They are now horrific and do not care about their customers. Most working people save all year to go on vacation. We have limited vacation time and money. Shame on you JetBlue!,-1

2023-07-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to New Yorl,5.0,,5.0,,,3.0,1,Absolutely terrible experience,False,  Absolutely terrible experience and finger pointing travel experience. Flight was booked through SATA airline with JetBlue providing domestic flights. First it was ridiculous to fly Tampa International Airport to Boston Logan then to JFK with Jet Blue; then SATA from JFK to Azores Ponta Delgada. Jet Blue cancelled flight to JFK at last hour. We even flew directly over JFK enroute to Boston Logan. Jet Blue’s agents were inconsiderate and not customer friendly or helpful service. They rebooked our flight for a day later with entirely different airline flying to Madrid then back to Azores a day late. This cut the time in Azores plus defeated the purpose of stopping in Azores for a shorter trip to Europe. Will never again Fly with JetBlue or recommend them to anyone. Another thing before taking off from Tampa the restrooms in the plane were nasty. I guess it just shows how poor an airline Jet Blue is based on my experience. To address finger pointing they blame the cancellation on weather. It wasn’t even raining or bad weather. We flew directly over JFK to Boston.,-1
2023-07-07,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale  to Providence,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,My flight was great,False,"  I recently flew on Jetblue from Florida to Providence and due to a glitch in reservations I had no flight booked just before check in the day before. I called Jetblue and they immediately fixed the problem and made sure I flew back home on June 22nd. The customer service rep was so concerned for me she got her supervisor online to help out. My flight was great. I used to be a 20 plus year Southwest Airlines frequent flyer, but due to the cancellation of direct flights from Providence RI to FT Lauderdale Florida I ditched them and have now been a loyal member of Jetblue for the last 2 years. As a frequent flyer of 12 flights per year I also have had a few delays, but were very far inbetween. I noticed that most of the complaints came from casual or vacation planers who are already under an incredible amount of anxiety and stress that comes along with travel. One of the best things for me about Jetblue is the InFlight entertainment that is in each seat rest. Otherwise the flight would be very boring.The snacks and drink selection is always great and the flight attendants are always helpful with whatever you need. As you read reviews that are negative please take into account these people are not regular travelers and expect everything to be perfect in this very time consuming and messed up world we all live in.",1
2023-07-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Reno,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolute worst airline experience,True,  Absolute worst airline experience I've ever had. Our flight was delayed 5 hours. We were told it was because the incoming flight from Las Vegas was delayed. When our plane arrived at LAX JetBlue used that plane to accommodate another flight that was on time. Since our flight was delayed they pushed us back hour after hour with no help or announcements from customer service. Anytime we asked for help we were told there's nothing they can do and they had no idea when we would take off. We still haven't even boarded or been updated in hours so we're at a 5 hour delay and counting. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. I was told this was a good airline to fly yet every other airline I've ever flown has treated their customers far better then this.,-1
2023-07-07,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Newark,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2,experiences left much to be desired,False,"  I recently had the opportunity to fly with JetBlue airlines on two separate occasions, and my experiences left much to be desired. While I appreciate that delays can happen, the level of inconvenience I faced on both my outbound and return flights was simply unacceptable. During my initial journey, my flight was delayed for four hours, causing significant disruption to my travel plans. This unexpected delay left me frustrated and feeling as though my time was not valued by the airline. I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but the lack of clear communication and assistance from the JetBlue staff compounded my disappointment. However, my dissatisfaction reached new heights when my return flight was delayed for five hours. The reason provided for this prolonged delay was particularly disheartening: the pilot was allegedly stuck in traffic. It is perplexing to think that such a vital member of the flight crew would not have contingencies in place to avoid traffic-related mishaps. This incident gave rise to concerns about the airline's organizational preparedness and overall professionalism. While I acknowledge that flight delays can occur across the industry, the recurrence of such extensive delays with JetBlue has left a lasting impression. The overall lack of transparency and efficiency in handling these situations left me questioning the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I must mention, however, that once the flights finally took off, the onboard experience was pleasant. The flight attendants were courteous and attentive, and the in-flight amenities provided a comfortable journey. However, these positive aspects were overshadowed by the significant inconveniences and frustrations I encountered at the start of both trips. In conclusion, my experiences with JetBlue airlines left me disappointed and hesitant to choose their services in the future. While the onboard experience was commendable, the recurring and excessively long delays I faced at the beginning of my trips, including a delay of five hours due to a pilot stuck in traffic, greatly overshadowed any positive aspects. I hope JetBlue takes this feedback constructively and focuses on improving their operational efficiency to ensure a more reliable and customer-centric service in the future.",-1
2023-07-06,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Palm Beach  to New York,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,My return was the real nightmare,False,"  Do not fly Jet Blue! My flight from PBI to JFK on June 20th was 4 hours late. My return was the real nightmare. I was scheduled to return on June 28th. I received an email on the night of the 27th that the flight was canceled. Jet Blue rescheduled me in the same flight on July 2nd. Four days later. They canceled that flight and rescheduled me on July 3rd from White Plains at 9PM, 30 miles away. I opted to get the refund and scheduled a flight on Delta for $480. The Delta flight left on time and arrived 20 minutes early. The flight from White Plains was delayed and I’m not sure if they canceled that as well. I am a frequent traveler and have never experienced a 5 day delay. That is unacceptable. I understand there were thunderstorms but even hurricanes in Florida don’t result in 5 day delays. Fortunately I have family in NYC, my sympathies go out to families that were forced to pay for hotels and meals and missed graduations, weddings, funerals and travel connections. I’ll never fly Jet Blue again.",-1
2023-07-06,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to New York,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,never fly with JetBlue ever again,True,"  My husband, my daughter and I were scheduled to travel with Jetblue from LAX to New York JFK on June 25, 2023 at 5:45 am with arrival at 2:20 pm. We were scheduled to fly out of new York JFK with Norse Atlantic at 6:20 pm to London Gatwick. We received an automated call at 12 am on June 25th along with an email that our JetBlue flight was canceled. The recording stated that we would be flying at 11:57 pm from Ontario to JFK with arrival at 8:20am on June 26, 2023 . That meant that we would miss our flight to London. We got on the phone, waited a half hour to be connected to a jetblue agent in Rwanda who after 45 minutes of researching told us that the best she could do is to refund our money, as she was unable to offer any other solutions. we asked to speak to a manager. we waited for 2 hours before giving up and accepting a refund. We had to rebook our entire vacation and connecting flights and hotel in Europe in 3 hours. It cost us extra 2500 usd to change our vacation. Later this week I found that the reason for cancellation was Crew legality which means they were short on pilots! Who did their scheduling? I will never fly with JetBlue ever again. Stay away from JetBlue. They will surely screw you.",-1
2023-07-05,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,they lost this customer,False, My Review is about Jet Blues administrative policy's. I spent hours picking out the right flight that met my needs for our vacation. A few weeks after booking Jet Blue cancels my flight and assigns me another flight. This new flight the picked for me was awful I would miss a whole days vacation because my original flight landed at 10AM and new Flight landed at 11:15 PM to my destination. My return flight switched from getting me home on a Sunday to a redeye arriving home on a Monday. Just didn't fit my needs and obviously a cheaper flight than I had booked. JetBlue allows you one change however they had NO FLIGHTS nonstop going to and from my destination. I called an agent to try and work things out however things went from bad to worst. They would refund my money but they would only put the money in a JetBlue bank that I could use one for one year. I didn't think this was fair since they made the change and now I was stuck trying to make jet blue work for me. I didn't want to leave money in a bank that I had to use within a year this was my money and they made the change not me. I had to rebook on different days and no longer was there a non stop option they all had at least one stop and a 6 hour trip each way turned into a 10 plus hour trip. Just what I was trying to avoid. I feel like Jet Blue is a bunch of thieves stealing my money and then charging me more money for an inferior flight. Spoke with supervisor and really worthless got the standard line of this is our policy. Whatever happened to treat the customer with respect and make them happy. Not so in this Airlines. I have been a loyal customer for years but lately (last three trips) things have been going wrong and this is the third time my flights were cancelled after taking so much time to plan. Jet Blue needs a new business plan because they lost this customer.,-1
2023-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to Orlando,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Totally unorganized company,True,"  Totally unorganized company. On our first flight from Orlando to Santo Domingo we waited 45 min at the gate because of mechanical issues. Then we boarded the flight only to be removed 30 min later. Gates were switched and boarded again a couple hours later. Then we waited on plane because they needed another crew to fly back since current pilots reached their limit. Another hour and a half later, they found another crew. We taxied to the runway then pilot says there’s a service light that came on. 10 min later that was resolved. Then they said their flight schedule was deleted and they had to wait another 30 min. I’m surprised we arrived to our destination that day. After we made it, we waited on our luggage over an hour before they got it to baggage claim. Now our trip back to Orlando ran an hour and a half late getting out of the gate including another gate change. We’ve landed in Orlando and now they don’t have a gate for us to pull into. Shame on this company, I’ll avoid them all together.",-1
2023-07-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Charlotte,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3,offered no compensation whatsoever for our troubles,False,"  Initial flight status was showing on time. However then delays started to come in. They announced over the intercom they lost our plane! How on earth do you lose a plane? They had to find us another plane. Went to another gate and eventually boarded that plane. Plane air conditioning was not working, the attendants told us that up front. Got on the runway and we got stopped due to weather. Sat on the runway for over an hour then went back to the gate and deplaned. Sat through many more delays and eventually got on plane again. Sat almost an hour before leaving the gate. Got on the runway and sat there for another hour. Still couldn't take off so took us back to the gate once again! Got off and we wanted to just cancel the flight. Would not let us until it was officially cancelled by them. Had to wait through more delays and eventually got cancelled late that night. Had to wait in a very long line to get tickets cancelled and refunded. There were no flights out the next 2 days at least. Note I still don't have my refund as of this review, said it takes 7-10 days. They offered no compensation whatsoever for our troubles. I know you can't control weather delays but the experience and customer service is something you can control. We had to get a rental car and drive from Boston to Charlotte to get home! Worst flying experience I ever had!",-1
2023-07-02,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Hartford,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1,We will never use Jet Blue again,True,"  
Our flight was cancelled a few hours before takeoff and we were informed it was due to flight mechanical issues and that we should receive compensation for our flight not being rebooked until 2 days later and that we would receive an email within 7 days with compensation. It took a while day to rebook everything for our trip, including 2.5 hours on the phone with jet blue. After speaking to the representative today, (9 days later and still no email) she said we were not getting compensation, but will not give the full reason why. This cancellation not only interrupted our full trip, but incurred late cancellation fees to correct. Since the reason for the cancellation was not a Forced Majeure Event, we should be allowed compensation. It is unacceptable. Our return flight was delayed twice as well. No reason given. We were pushed to the last row of the plane (since it was rebooked due to the original cancellation and we didn't get seats until we arrived) where the stewards were very loudly banging several times throughout the flight startling me and waking up the screaming infant after she finally fell asleep (several times). This was the worst experience I have ever had and we fly regularly. We will never use Jet Blue again.",-1
2023-07-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,got delayed 12 hours,False,"  The worst ever, bought a flight and got delayed 12 hours, going back the same thing almost 10 hours. When i was in Newark they said they where late because of weather condition in Florida, now I'm in Florida and they are delay because of the weather in Newark. Then they tell you that airline traffic department wont allow them to land but they will need to cancel because now they don't have an airplane, when people decides to cancel their trip 1-2 hours later they get an airplane, I think they overbook or they put 2 flights into one.",-1
2023-07-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Hartford,4.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,lying when they said we could get a refund,False,"  On April 17, 2023, I was scheduled on a jetblue flight from Fort Lauderdale to Hartford. About an hour before the approximately 7:00 flight, they announced a delay. They updated it with a further delay until 10:10. Around 9:30 they announced the flight was cancelled. Of course, everyone rushed to the jetblue ticket counter. It was chaos. They began announcing and continued to repeat the announcement that they could not get anyone on a flight to the northeast until Friday (this was Monday). They repeatedly announced that if you wanted to reschedule (not before Friday), you should wait in line at the ticket counter. If you wanted a REFUND, don't wait in line and call jetblue. I chose the latter. A few days later, I phoned jetblue. The agent said there would be no refund, but as a courtesy he would give me a travel credit. I recently checked the travel credits and it's not there. I contacted jetblue. The agent said she has no record of the credit and, anyway, there is no credit for flights canceled due to weather. So, the agents making the announcement at the FLL airport were lying when they said we could get a refund. The agent who said he would give me a travel credit lied too.",-1

We’ve waited another 2 hours in the plane due to heavy traffic, then the pilot has announced the plane has so much fuel and they got us off the plane. After we left the plane, they said the flight canceled because there are no crew to flight. I couldn’t believe what I heard. My first time and the last time flying with this airplane. The other passengers said it happens all the time. İt was terrible experience. Stay away from this airplane",-1
2023-06-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Los Angeles,,,,,,1.0,1,later deny us a refund,True,"  My wife and I arrived at the airport 90 minutes in advance, and the flight was delayed 30 minutes, so we ended up 2 hours early. The lines for baggage drop-off were out the door. We used a JetBlue kiosk to purchase two bag tags to check two of our bags; it charged us for two but only printed out one. We were told by a JetBlue employee to go to the kiosk help desk line to address the issue: there were two snaking lines of maybe 20-30 people each, manned by just two employees, and they were moving at the rate of one customer every 10-15 minutes. Were we to wait in that line, we almost certainly were going to miss our flight. So, we elected to use a second kiosk to purchase a bag tag for our second bag in the hopes this one would work; it didn't, but it took our money (again). So, rather than jump from kiosk to kiosk, paying more and more money in the hope that one would work, which is unreasonable, we were forced to wait in line. By the time we reached the front, the JetBlue employee told us that we were going to miss our flight and that, in addition, the flight was ""overbooked,"" so they were going to have to ""rebook"" or ""cancel."" She searched for other flights that day, including through JetBlue, its partner American Airlines, and non-partner airlines; the earliest available flight was July 1. It was the morning of June 28, we had just moved out of our apartment and shipped our stuff to LA, and we were scheduled to move into our new LA apartment that same day, so we would have had to pay for food and lodging for the interval period in Boston--a hefty price--rather than stay in our new paid-for apartment in LA. We explained this to the JetBlue employee, who said that she would cancel our flight and issue a refund for our tickets and bags. I requested confirmation that this would be to our original payment method; she confirmed it would be. There was only one more flight in the entire Boston region that had capacity to take us to LA before July 1: a flight leaving in two hours out of Providence. My wife and I booked the flight, quickly compared taxi and rideshare prices, discovered the difference was negligible, and took an Uber to the airport in Providence, where we successfully boarded the last flight to LA. We later discovered that we had been deceived by the JetBlue employee at the kiosk help desk in Boston; she did NOT issue any refund and instead wrote in her ""notes"" that my wife and I were ""late"" to check in our bags, which was a complete lie and clearly intended to create a fabricated, falsified paper trail to later deny us a refund. We could not check in our bags because JETBLUE'S kiosks were defective, but that didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives. The fact that we were told the flight was overbooked even though it apparently wasn't didn't matter to JetBlue's customer ""service"" representatives.  We had to fight for hours over the phone to even get our bags refunded; we're still on the hook for the tickets according to JetBlue's ""policy.""",-1

Upon waking up at 4am to get to the airport we had received an email after midnight saying our flight was cancelled. There was no reason provided. There is no phone number to get help. Just hey click here for a refund or reschedule, no ability to reschedule to next day and it was a 13 hour flight. We were flying non-stop, the $$$ we have put into this trip so we quickly looked for other airlines. Everything is booked or outrageous prices do to last minute booking. So disappointed, my daughter needs to be in Florida to visit a college so we will make the trip, but is now costing us a whole lot more. So my advice, spend the little extra $$ and fly Delta. We did find a direct flight out of Provo, only flight we could find Allegiant Airlines. Not sure how this will go, but at least we will get to the beach at the end of day.",-1

As a result, we missed our connecting flight in FLL & JAX. The rep for Jetblue said she could book us the following day, but wouldn't help with a room.

2023-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Richmon,,,,,,1.0,1,I cannot recommend this company,False,"  I cannot recommend this company in any way! We checked via phone. Arrived at the Airport 2 hours early after verifying flight. The check in machines were down. Long, long lines. People were yelling at the counter people. All these people could have easily been helped with the simple announcement ‘flight xyz has been canceled due to xxx.’ But no, they made everyone go through a long, hot line at Ft Lauderdale to tell us one by one that our flight had been canceled! The next flight to our destination was the following day at 8;00 pm!! 24 hours, no hotel accommodation, no complimentary ticket via another airline! Worse, I was told I had to apply online for a refund! That system wasn’t working. I waited on the phone for 50 minutes to have some guy 1st tell me my ticket was non-refundable. Then without apologizing he said there would be a $100 cancellation fee that I had to pay with the same credit card because they could not process a partial refund! I kid you not! What a joke!!

2023-06-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to New York,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,awful response from customer service,True," On June 16th, my husband and I were set to fly out of Cancun at noon. We received notification that the flight was delayed, but the email also said they were working to resolve it and to come to the airport on time anyway. Long story short, we spend over 12 hours waiting as our flight kept getting delayed. I attempted to contact customer service several times but received no update or information. In fact, the customer service chat was very rude. In the end, at the very last minute, our flight was canceled with no information. We were automatically booked on the next flight out the following day. The biggest problem with this story is that I was personally hosting a baby shower for my best friend on the 17th. JetBlue gave us no opportunity to rebook the flight, (and they ADMITTED they knew it was going to be canceled early in the day), nor did they allow us to cancel on our own to reschedule through a different airline. So 4 months of planning a baby shower and a lot of money spent, they had nothing to offer me. I've cried several times over this. To top it off, my husband and I stayed at a highly nice resort, The Excellence, during our vacation, and JetBlue put us up in a motel in Cancun that was not even 1% comparable, and to be honest, a little scary with no security. They also offered us ""dinner"" - a four-plate buffet of stale food at 11:00 p.m. at night. It was absolutely AWFUL. In the end, on the day of our departure (the 17th) we both received an apology email clearly stating that THEY screwed up and it was an ""avoidable cancellation."" They then went on to offer a $100 credit to each of us. $100! What does that even get us? We don't get our time back, let alone enough credit to take another flight! We spent hours at an airport and spending money on food. $100 doesn't nearly cover it. Last night wrote a long email to the executives that I could find, and the response that I received was ""Too bad, you only get $100."" I have never in my life had such a worse travel experience nor received the most awful response from customer service.",-1

2023-06-17,0.2,Business,Economy Class,San Juan to St Thomas,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never forgive JetBlue,True,"  JetBlue customer service and system is pathetic. We came to St Thomas on vacation but had a family emergency & need to return immediately. I called Jet Blue to inquire about options. It took so long to get a human, then she didn’t seem to understand the situation, then she could only cancel our existing return but couldn’t book our new return. We spent 4.5 hours talking to 3 different people, and by then there were no flights available for tomorrow. Desperate, we tried to book flights for the next day, and Jet Blues awful app would not take my payment—USING a Jet Blue credit card! I tried another credit card, then another, nothing. I was frantic! It turns out the app had raised the ticket price while I was putting in my information (which I shouldn’t have to do. I fly every week and have a rewards membership). I am livid and disgusted by JetBlue. There is no reason not to hire intelligent agents-and plenty of them-who take ownership of a problem, and no reason not to empower them to solve problems. If these agents had not taken 4.5 hours to cancel a flight and “manually” refund points, then we would be at my family’s bedside. I will never forgive JetBlue, and I’m cutting up my Jet Blue credit card.",-1

There has been delays upon my trip back home. I can understand an hour but to have to sit in the airport for 7 hours is ridiculous. When you are not being told substantial reason is even more unacceptable. This is an inconvenience to me as I have other important things to take care of. In addition, having to come at the initial time frame of the original flight is even more ridiculous. Having to come to the airport at 2:00pm and not leaving until after 9:30pm does not make any sense to me. I have been flying with JetBlue for years and it seems like the services is getting worse. There is more fees added and decrease in adequate services. I am going to have to take my service elsewhere.",-1
2023-06-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Albuquerque,2.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1,never fly JetBlue ever again,False,"  We tried to fly home from New York JFK to Albuquerque on Jet Blue Flight #0065 on Friday, June 2, but it turned out to be a total customer service nightmare. We sat on the runway for 2 hours waiting on a “weather delay” while watching other airlines take off and land. After the initial “weather delay” announcement, the flight crew and attendants were non-responsive to our passenger questions and would not provide any further updates on when we would be taking off. After this 2-hour delay, it was announced that we were returning to the gate because the flight crew could not exceed their “flight time hours”. While waiting for an additional 2 hours for a new flight crew to show up but never did, the gate staff were very dismissive and would not provide any updates on our flight departure. We also never received any e-mail or text updates from JetBlue like we did before the flight. After watching our luggage being unloaded from the plane, the gate staff finally admitted that the flight was canceled. After being told to pick up our luggage at baggage claim and to report to a ticketing office to be booked on JetBlue Flight #0066 or on another flight the next morning, we and the other 200+ passengers waited for another 2 hours in a long line while being chastised by ticketing staff to be more patient! After noticing that Flight #0066 was canceled without explanation and after being informed by other passengers that new tickets or hotel accommodations were not being issued by the ticketing staff, it became clear to us that customer service is not a priority for Jetblue so we decided to buy tickets on Delta Airlines at a considerable cost for our return flight home. This was our first and last flight on JetBlue. We will never fly JetBlue ever again.",-1

2023-06-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,LaGuardia to Jacksonville,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,will never use this airline again,True,"  I originally booked a 9 am Jet Blue , B6-340 departure Jacksonville Fl that i would arrive in NY well ahead of The drive rush hour to CT some 39 miles away. JB changed my flight to a 12:30 flight that got me to NY at 2:45, middle of the rush hour. 3 hour drive in heavy traffic to CT. RETURN FLIGHT June 7. Flight 2339 Flight delayed 3 1/2 hours as they used our aircraft for a fully booked flight to Tampa, our Jacksonville flight was about 60% populated. The cabin crew or dispatcher or whomever is responsible for catering the aircraft failed to notify the caterer of the new time, gate etc whatever is needed for the caterer to know where to meet the aircraft. Many passengers were aware of the aircraft switch off and voiced their disapproval of this move. I heard many folks like myself resolve to never fly Jet Blue again. The crew did a very nice job of taking care of us however they could not offer hit coffee or tea as the plane was not catered, Jet Blue offered us a 50$ credit which is nonuse to me as i will never use this airline again. This is the third time JB has botched my flights from or to NY where I travel on a monthly basis. On one JB flight that was cancelled I booked a Delta flight home from JFK after getting a cab from LGA so i would not have to wait 36 hrs for a connecting flight thru Boston to get home to Jacksonville flying Jet Blue. This cost me 559$. No more Jet Blue, they really do not manage the company as though they care about the passenger.",-1
2023-06-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Newark,,,,,,1.0,1,going to stop flying JetBlue,False,"  After a grueling day getting off a cruise ship and waiting hours to pass through Immigration and Customs, my daughter and I learned that our flight was delayed .. not once or twice but several times. Their excuse was inclement weather in the northeast but as it turns out (as I happened to overhear from two airport staff guys later that day), flight crews had refused to work our flight back to NY. Two hours after we were originally supposed to depart, they canceled our flight with no real explanation. I scrambled to rebook another flight home and our only option was a flight on American to NJ instead of NY. I booked it though the app, ended up paying for our seats, and though we finally made it back, my grief wasn't over. I have been trying to claim miles/points for that flight for us since and repeatedly that request was denied! Jetblue lies about how to get your miles/points. You can request them all you want but you'll never get them. I'm going to stop flying JetBlue. I'll fly with a carrier that actually cares about their customers. Save yourself the aggravation and do the same.",-1

My sister had been hit by a car and was in the hospital. JetBlue had June 5th at 7:09am available. I chose that. Returning June 8th. I got to the airport only to see the flight was canceled and rescheduled for the next day. The next morning I arrived and their system didn’t show I was issued a ticket for the flight. I arrived for my only (20 minute) layover in Boston. But that got delayed to 2.5 hours. Why is this airline so incompetent? But hey, it was all worth it because they gave me a $50 credit for cancelling the flight on June 5.",-1

Everything when perfect, landed waited 2 hours for my luggage just to find out they weren’t here at Santiago - all right went to claim it, the lady was just like oh I don’t know where your luggage it’s your receipts shows at inactive, why would they give me a receipt if it is inactive? Then she said that she cannot give me info about where is my luggage and that she doesn’t.

The original flight that was booked was MORE expensive than the flight I am looking to change to. However, Jet Blue is wanting to charge twice the amount with all of its fees. I am very disappointed in how customer service treats its customers and will think twice about booking with your airline in the future.",-1
2023-06-05,0.3,Business,Economy Class,New York to Las Vegas,,,,,,,2,experience was extremely disappointing,False,"  The booking process went smoothly. However, the cancellation experience was extremely disappointing as there were no alternative options provided. The customer support agent I spoke with was rude, lacked compassion, and proved to be unhelpful.  I had no choice but to book another flight with a different airline, which came at a significant expense, just to reach my destination 12 hours later than planned, causing me to be late for a speaking engagement. Moreover, when I called to reschedule my return trip, I encountered a similar lack of empathy and was informed that one flight's cancellation had no impact on the booking of another. To make matters worse, there were no options provided to speak to a supervisor, despite being told that I was already speaking to one who displayed the same rudeness and lack of understanding. Overall, while I used to consider Jetblue a reliable airline, this experience has significantly diminished my confidence in them. From now on, they will not be my top choice for air travel.",-1

2023-06-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Miami,,,,,,1.0,1,I will never fly JetBlue again,False,"  Haven't even flown with them yet and it's already been super stressful. I booked flight on my cruise line to the Eastern Caribbean for a vacation package with airfare from San Jose to Miami for the first Saturday of June (this weekend) and I have had to pick my same seats next to my friend THREE times already. First time, no charge, included in my itinerary (as it should be) but the connecting flight was originally too close to boarding time for the cruise, so they moved the connecting flight to one that is earlier and even though our original flight from San Jose to our layover was the same, they cancelled our seats for both flights. I had to book the same seats (with a cost). I messaged their chat and was assured by the agent I'd receive a refund for the seats while still guaranteed my original seats next to my friend for both flights. I check my itinerary today to confirm and they cancelled my seats when they refunded me.  I chatted with them again today and there's nothing they can do, so now I have had to pay for my flights, seats, and baggage for eachflight (4 total at $35 each flight for just my one check bag and $30 for my seats each way) 3 days before my already expensive vacation. I will never fly JetBlue again. I don't even care if the service on the flights re good. This stress and expense is unacceptable right before a vacation.",-1

I waited nearly three hours for the bags to be delivered. Apparently it was raining and lightning and the airline would not send crews out in the weather. Three hours seems like a long wait, but if it was for security reasons, I would have understood. However, Jet Blue never sent a rep to inform people of the issue, how it was being resolved or how long it would take. There were a multitude of carousels with people waiting for bags and JB was NO help. They were making announcements over a PA system that most of us could not hear or understand. There were a few JB employees - waiting with passengers. I approached one and asked if he knew what the problem was. He suggested I go to the Baggage Service Office. There were three women sitting there. Not one of them wandered out of their office to explain to everyone at the airport waiting for luggage what the problem was. When I asked she said ""I just spoke with them. They're working on it."" The lack of concern and professionalism was very disappointing. One passenger said her husband got an $80 ticket waiting for her. My friends waited over 2 hours in the cell phone lot - one of them is in a wheelchair. No offer of some kind of compensation or an apology. I also had spotty wi-fi. Not the first time this has happened to me on a JB flight. It used to be my preferred airline. Next flight I will shop around. This was one of the worst flight experiences I've ever had. No wonder they're #7. I remember when they used to be #1 customer rated.",-1

The website is so glitched you end up calling a clueless, helpless reservation agent. If you do manage a successful online transaction with an actual confirmation code be sure to triple check because chances are it will be an incomplete record because the payment process never works.

2023-05-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Turks and Caicos,,,,,,,1,Jetblue is making my blood boil,False,"  I never even got to fly to my destination, Jetblue robbed me of over $1000 and are trying to shift the blame on me. I booked a honeymoon flight for my wife and I back in 2021, which we could not take because of covid restrictions. We were issued travel credits (that expire for no apparent reason) instead of a refund. Now we had to scramble to find the time and money to take a vacation within their expiry period during a global pandemic. We tried to book a flight for a shorter vacation, but the schedule would not work out for us so we would have to postpone by canceling that next flight. They gave us a hard time for even doing that like we were trying to find some loophole to buy more time (but why do these even expire?). Then we could finally cancel it and receive MOST of our credit back and they sent an email saying the credit will be valid until it expires (1 year per their policy), but they did not list the date on the email. I tried to go back and book a summer vacation using point I knew I had and saw those points expired THE DAY AFTER THE REFUND. I called to ask them to reinstall that credit since there was no warning and customer service hung up on me. I called back and someone at the escalation department was saying it was my fault for not being responsible with the credit! The gall on these people trying to gaslight and steal from me! Then when I asked how could this corporation have the heart to do this to someone who saved their hard earned money for their honeymoon that was shafted by the pandemic, they hung up on me again. Jetblue is making my blood boil! I tried citing them to the BBB but they sent some pre-generated response about the BBB not having jurisdiction over them because of the Airline Deregulation Act.",-1

The tickets economy class are 1700usd one way, in return most of the flights are over 1-4 hrs delayed on a constant. The agents are extremely rude not even a welcome on board, no ice for any of the beverages and the list goes on. I hope that they won’t find themselves in the same situation as American Airlines that did the same thing in exploiting the Caribbean countries, and now no one from the islands make them 1st choice when traveling.

After destroying my bag, the claims office at the Boston airport made all these promises and for a brief moment, I felt assured I'd be taken care of. Not only are they negligent but they're trying to get away with not paying me. Airport staff took photos of every item damaged, and I provided receipts for 10 out of 13 items (who even keeps receipts from years ago!?), still no payment is being made as they're trying to get away with not paying me.",-1

I had already booked two luggage’s with the reservation but needed to pay for an additional two pieces ! I had no card but Apple Pay I was told to go to the atm and withdraw the cash. I had no card hence not having access to withdraw with the card! There are limited options for paying. Come on it’s 2023! I asked three agents to help me to pay in the Jetblue app and they did not know how to proceed - very distasteful of this airline. I had previously held such high expectations and esteem of this airline. I will take my services elsewhere. There were also not one seat for customers the elderly and very young can benefit from having such. Overall the standards of this airline have desperately fallen.,-1

I made it to the boarding door 60 seconds, yes 60 seconds late and they would not let me board. Man was completely rude. Again 60 seconds late because of airport workers. They gave me another flight almost 4 hours later causing me to miss an important meeting. They also did not assign me a seat and instructed me to go to new gate and speak with attendant there. SHE WAS FANTASTIC, explained everything in detail and was super nice with incredible customer service skills. She bought me back to Jet Blue. Incredible person and deserves many prompts.

2023-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Myers,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,beyond ridiculous to be charged even more,False,"  JetBlue cancelled our flight to Fort Myers, FL minutes before we were to leave for the airport. I followed instructions to switch flights online, and when I did so, found that the next flight to Fort Myers was 2 days out. To travel the same day, I was forced to take a flight to nearby Tampa, FL instead. I was charged an additional $320 to do this. However, in the ""Flights Cancelled by JetBlue"" section of the ""Delays, Cancellations, and Schedule Changes"" page on the website (https://www.jetblue.com/help/delays-and-cancellations), it states that I should be able to switch to another flight at no charge if JetBlue cancelled. I contacted them through their website to request a refund, which was denied on the grounds that they claim that I willfully elected to fly to a different city - this is a completely ridiculous claim, since they cancelled the flight, and the next flight to the same city was multiple days out. No other flights were cancelled or delayed at all that day, indicating no staffing issues. There was no inclement weather on either end. This implies that they must have cancelled because not enough people were on the flight, so it was no longer profitable. It's concerning that US-based airlines are allowed to do this with flights at the last possible minute. As if JetBlue hasn't already jerked me around enough: 5 weeks after the flight, I got an email from them saying I was ""undercharged"" for services offered, and they're going to charge me even more this coming week. It was aggravating enough to be refused a refund, but beyond ridiculous to be charged even more well over a month after the cancelled flight. Beginning to enter scam-like territory.",-1

While I understand that times have been tough for many, JetBlue is the only company I interact with where its employees consistently have blatant attitude problems and clearly don't care about its customers. I’m a laid-back person and can deal with lost bags, delayed flights, and less-than-ideal hubs, but when it’s employees consistently seem angry and look down upon their clients, I cannot help but use another service. During my last trip, there was a system malfunction that swapped my flight out and upon calling the service, they were beyond unreasonable in lending assistance for an issue that was their fault in the first place. Another experience that has left me feeling disrespected and disappointed. I am officially done with JetBlue. I hope this serves as a warning to others who may be considering their services. Stick with Delta, Southwest, American, or even discount airlines such as Spirit or Frontier – the staff is friendlier and helpful and their planes are fine if not better for many flights. FYI: The overall flight and employees are particularly bad flying from New York to Fort Lauderdale and New York to Savannah.",-1

My husband and I were also scheduled to board a cruise ship in Miami, which we scheduled ground transportation from the FLL airport. We had to be on board the ship no later than 3:00 pm. The flight was first delayed to leave at 10:31 am, which caused concern for us as time would be cutting it close but we decided to not panic. This was announced at around 8:30 am. Not even 1 hour after the first delay, it was announced that we were delayed again to leave at 12:30pm! Meanwhile, at the gate next to us, 2 aircrafts scheduled for West Palm Beach, Fl (1 left at approximately 9 and the other boarding at approximately 11) seemed to have no problem. The desk attendants finally let us know that the aircraft was having mechanical issues and that they were working on it. We tried to get on another flight but were told that we would not be able to get our luggage and that West Palm Beach was more than an hour away from Miami. We had to contact the transportation/cruise line to cancel our trip. This was extremely disappointing and heartbreaking. We had planned for months to have a vacation and JetBlue ruined our experience. We found out that the flight was again delayed to 1:30 and subsequently, it left at 2:21, arriving at FLL at 5:08 pm! JetBlue could have announced that there were mechanical issues from the start and offered us optional flights at 8:55. Having a flight credit and adding 100.00 to our account could not and would not replace the memories stolen from us. My husband chose this airline because he was offered a credit card to accumulate points and benefits. So we were let down all the across the board.",-1

The check-in process was ok but once on board, we were greeted by an extremely rude and full of attitude airhostess. We were a family of four with two babies. We had to take the long ramp up the flight and I had foldable overhead stroller which one of babies was sitting in. The air hostess kept taunting and making comments on how I should have folded my stroller before boarding. She refused to help with my stuff. She threw my jackets on the floor. After that she started complaining about our carry on and that we should have checked that in as well. They told us they were upgrading us at the check in counter and charged us $500 but there is no business class on Jetblue, its all the same seats. The seats were uncomfortable and cramped, with no room to move or stretch out. Both air hostess gave us attitude till we got off. We were already stressed out as kids were not feeling well. We were treated horribly. We traveled to Punta CAna from NY on American Airlines and such a wonderful experience and service from everyone. Unfortunately, we had to take Jetblue back due to a family emergency but the flight attendants made sure we were treated badly. Overall, I would not recommend flying with Jetblue to anyone.

2023-04-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Punta Cana via New York,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1,absolutely worthless,True," If you're looking to get to your destination on time, JetBlue is absolutely worthless! They are apparently now among the list of worst airlines for cancellations and delays. Not only was our initial flight from SLC to FLL (and then to PUJ) delayed 4 times, it was finally cancelled, for something not only under their control, but something they would have known about for hours and didn't let the passengers know until about 3 in the morning (their phone support even attempted to say it was due to weather, but there were no weather issues in SLC or JFK where the flight crew was coming from, and we even verified that with the airline). Which means we missed our connecting flight. Then they rebooked us taking a completely different route to our final destination (JFK instead of FLL), which was then delayed and delayed and delayed, making the connecting flight a problem once again. We spend HOURS and HOURS on support with them, trying to get everything situated. We missed out on about $1000 in resort time that we had paid for, not including our time, gas, and other things we had to pay for. And JetBlue's response? Too bad, so sad. They took zero responsibility, and very rudely said they wouldn't do anything for us, even after being very calm with them. Pathetic airline. Will never use them again, and will be cancelling our JetBlue card. Not worth the extra legroom if you can't get to where you need to be on time.",-1
2023-04-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Vancouver via JFK,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,worst budget airline to fly with,True,"  I tried to check in via Jetblue website on my phone but at credit card payment screen it timed out and I had to download the app to check in. I checked in as normal and head to the airport the next day with my family, the check-in machine at the airport could only print one of the check bags tags and we had to wait in line to check our other 2 bags. All went well till I got my credit card statement and JetBlue charged an additional USD45 for a 4th bag. I phoned JetBlue customer service team explain the issue and after an hour of holding and keep explaining to different people they came back that there is nothing they can do as the mistake was done at the airport and there is no way for them to verify that only 3 bags was checked. I explained I have the email confirming that there was only 3 bags but they still could give me a credit. Its ridicules that their customers cannot pay for carrier on if you are not a JetBlue member and have to pay for checked baggage, we had to pay for seat selection as well on our connecting flight from JFK to YVR to complete the check-in process, money grab. First and last time I will fly with JetBlue, their service is horrible and they dont care about the customers. I have flown with budget airlines before but for the expensive price you have to pay to get such bad service they are by far the worst budget airline to fly with.",-1
2023-04-19,0.2,Business,Economy Class,San Jose to Barbados via New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,they refused to let me board,True,"  I googled extensively and was flying to see a friend in Barbados who said no entry requirements and that you will fill out the form once you land in Barbados. 30 minutes before my flight leaves I get called to the boarding desk to show the ""entry form"" and barcode which I of course did not have. I tried the site and filling it out twice but the site was not working. It is not required beforehand and this was from an official immigration officer at Barbados) I'm not angry at the people at the boarding desk because I do understand they were doing their job but they refused to let me board the plane until I had this particular document which I could not get at all because the site is not working. A nice manager walked out and had to get on a computer for 20 minutes and by so miracle got it handled so I could board the plane. I was livid and so upset that I was not going to be allowed to board my plane over something that is not even necessary! Truly the immigration officer at Barbados thought the whole thing was ridiculous and everyone else on the plane (coming from the US) was able to fill out their form at customs. They thought what happened to me was insane and did not understand why the San Jose Airport/Jet Blue demanded I have that and almost denied me getting on that plane. The first plane ride was 4 hours and a red eye and absolute hell. They kept the lights on the entire time, and the flight attendants kept coming up and down the aisle hitting me with elbow/tray at least 20 times. They were angry. 40 minutes before landing they start screaming at everyone to wake up and the person next to me in the middle seat had her seat back and was sound asleep with her hood over her eyes. A flight attendant walked up and stood over me to forcibly yank her seat back, yank her hood off and tell her to""wake up. They then just glared at me to remove the bag off my lap while we still had 30 minutes to land. On my next flight to Barbados, no one asked for this stupid entry form when I was boarding which I thought was super comical. I was in a middle seat and when I sat down there was stuff in the aisle seat but no one around. Flight attendants kept asking me over and over whose stuff it was and I'm like don't know. Finally a sweet older lady comes up with a cane and says everybody calm down, I was at the back of the plane allowing everyone to come though because it's really hard for me to get up and down (come to find out the poor lady had a knee injury). Flight attendants were so rude to her. I had been flying for over 12 hours and was extremely thirsty and kept getting such attitude when I asked for water. I asked one male attendant who never brought it to me & when I asked the female attendant a second time for more water in my water bottle and a sparkling water, she rolls her eyes and fills up my water bottle halfway and doesn't give me a sparkling water and just walks away.",-1
2023-04-19,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours,False,"  JetBlue has to be the worst airline flying out of South Florida right now especially since the fort Lauderdale closure on April 12th JetBlue has canceled the late night fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas flight (flight 607) three times. One flight was canceled on a Monday which 3 days after they actually opened up the airport. That also means that the people in Las Vegas waiting for flight 607 cannot get back to fort Lauderdale because the flight never gets to Las Vegas! The ripple effects are disastrous JetBlue also has four local flights such as fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville and Jacksonville back to the fort Lauderdale and fort Lauderdale to Cuba and Cuba back to fort Lauderdale (flight number 17, 18 1499 and 1500) and for the past 4 days each of them have been delayed anywhere from 3 to 6 hours with two of them being canceled all together and weather really has nothing to do with it since April 15th the weather has been fine down here we have had very little rain. But even the four local flights which are only about an hour and 20 minutes apart also been delayed 3 to 6 hours or have been canceled About a year ago Jetblue stated to the public that they will have fewer frequency of flights which will allow them more flexibility when things go wrong but obviously that is not the case.",-1

They got confused there was two flights leaving to JFK, we were given the wrong gate number so the lady told us we would have to wait, only 2 seats available only our flight but figure we have 6 tickets. I purchased my infant a seat and had no choice but to fly with my infant and 5 year old. My husband had to wait and get on the next flight with my 8 year old and 9 year old. When we asked why we don’t have seats we were told they had to give our seats to flight attendants so why not notify us prior. JetBlue broke my stroller and all they gave me was a credit for my infant seat, disgusting.",-1

Delay after extended delay and the crew is acting like it’s just another day with little regard for how much our days have been turned inside out. Their only recourse is to offer points for the next trip with JetBlue. Why on earth would anyone travel with them again.? Do not travel with JetBlue. The few dollars saved is not worth spending an entire day in an airport n missing functions because of delayed flights.,-1

Next I noticed my travel credit was removed from my account, I contacted them via chat and was told I had to use it within 5 days, I booked a flight but due to illness we had to cancel, but now I'm being told I loose my original travel credit of over $500. What I don't understand is why do they expire so soon, now they dont want to give me my travel credit back. Is like I gave them my money and they want me to book a reservation with the limit restrictions, if its my money either give it back or let me travel when I want to travel no when they tell me to travel. They truly are thieves, took over $500 as bad as economy is and they want to steal from their customers? Never will I fly with them again!",-1

Instead of me loosing my cool, after asking her to politely lean her seat up just a bit so my legs aren’t smushed, she caught a major attitude and said no. I called a flight attendant for assistance and the flight attendant instantly took sides stating the passenger in front of me had the right to lean her seat back to her comfortability, which is totally understandable planes are small and not as roomy, however allowing someone to violate someone else personal space for there comfort is not fair nor okay instead of the flight attendant defusing the situation and coming up with a fair solution she quickly sided and then followed up her last sentence asking me if I understood as if I was the problem as the lady infront of me smiled. It was very degrading. I was emotionally bothered and out of place the whole 5hr which sucked for the amount of money paid.",-1
2023-04-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Richmond,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,such a horrible experience,True,"  I am appalled at JetBlue. They cancelled my flight while I was at the airport and left me stranded with a 2 year old and 3 year old. The flight was cancelled b/c the airplane broke down, there was equipment failure caused by a maintenance issue. I scrambled to get a hotel. I was told by the JetBlue customer representative that I would be reimbursed for my hotel stay. I later find out they will not reimburse me for the hotel and instead gave me a travel bank credit of a very nominal amount compared to the inconvenience I endured. I tried to use the travel bank credit for a future flight found on JetBlue's website only to find out it wouldn't apply because the flight was by Jetblue but operated by another airline. I have never in my life had such a horrible experience with an airline. Imagine traveling with a screaming 2 year old and 3 year old. They gave me $50 credit as if that would sufficiently compensate for the entire suffering. We had to stay at a terrible airport hotel down the street which cost a fortune due to being last minute and JetBlue absolutely refuses to reimburse me for it. And now I can't even use this travel credit they gave me. I have travelled the world with various airlines and by far Jetblue is the worst airline./ Pay a little extra and book with another airline.",-1

More than the cancellation, the agents at the airport told me that my hotel would be compensated for up to $250 given there were no more flights for the day. When I got home, the customer service agents said that this was not what they said, and that they likely meant, your hotel might be reimbursed up to that amount. It was really surprising and also given the hassle and additional expenses we had to incur to get a hotel and to another airport the next day, it was really frustrating.",-1

I tried to reschedule to a 9pm flight that same evening and had to either wait 15 minutes to chat with someone or 35 minutes for a phone call. I was advised that the 9pm flight was full and told thank you without any further assistance. I had to reschedule surgeries I was supposed to perform the next day as I would arrive home at 4am for work at 8am. I arrived to the airport at 10pm and once I got through security I was advised that the flight was delayed another hour. At this point I had to cancel the entire shift and will be sending an invoice to Jetblue for pay I missed. This airline is complete garbage and should absolute merge with Spirit to complete the partnership of trash airlines. They also charge $300 a seat and do not include a carry on.,-1

Two days before flight seating assignment was changed. Have heard similar stories where seating was changed last minute from others traveling on JetBlue flights. This is a real problem for families traveling with children who need to sit together. Added stress my last 2 flights had issue with TV service. Problem with audio or not working at all.

In this day and age it’s such a bonus when bags are included with the tickets. Both flights took off on time. We enjoyed the meal on the way out. Not so keen on the breakfast options on the return. No skimping on the drinks or the snacks. All in all a very pleasurable experience with ample legroom. Will definitely use them again.,1

2023-03-29,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Kingston,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1,"no apology or additional credit"" ",False,"  I’m beyond disappointed with the delays that I experienced with JetBlue for my flights to (flight 1759) and from (flight 8072) Kingston, Jamaica. I paid $590 for my flight and believed that I chose a good alternative to Delta, since Delta didn’t have any nonstop flights to Kingston at the time that I booked, however I was sadly wrong. My uncle and I arrived at JFK airport more than three hours in advance of departure and had to wait from 7am-3pm before we were able to take off. The reason we were given for the delay was that the plane hadn’t left Fort Lauderdale which is what we were told prior to the delay switching from 1:29pm to 3pm. JetBlue did email an apology but only offered a $50 credit, 8% of what I paid for my flight and $15 less than the fee for a checked bag on JetBlue needless to say significantly less than it would cost to book another flight. This may have sufficed if it only happened on the way to Kingston but leaving Kingston to JFK (originally flight 1060 switched to flight 8072) I received three emails that morning as I prepared for my flight, one stating that it has been delayed from 9:14am to 1:29pm but still requesting for me to arrive at the original time, the second email stating that it’s been canceled and then a third with a new flight number (8072) departing at 1:00pm. Another day on the same trip waiting at the airport from 6:30am to 1:00pm. I guess two hours earlier is an improvement in JetBlues eyes because I received no apology or additional credit. The only saving grace was that the flight crew was pleasant. Here’s the kicker, the reason for the delay was that the plane hadn’t left Fort Lauderdale. My uncle flew out the day before I did and also experienced the same half-day delay. This is truly unacceptable. It seems like it’s a common practice instead of a coincidence for their flights to Jamaica. Because of the delays going to Kingston my uncle and I had to get a hotel so we wouldn’t have to drive 2hrs that night to our final destination once we finally arrived. The credit doesn’t even measure up to the time wasted and additional money having to be spent due to the delays and same excuse. So please tell me why would I ever consider booking JetBlue to go anywhere else with a $50 credit to experience the same things.",-1
2023-03-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Aruba to Boston,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2,She was extremely rude,True,  I have been flying Jet Blue for years and have said many good things about jet blue and hospitality from crew members. However yesterday flying from Aruba to Boston I had a very rude crew member on flight B6 273 on March 27th. I was being courteous waiting to go to the bathroom and when it was my turn this crew had answered the phone from the Pilot and stated we need to be seated for 15 min per the captains orders. I quickly went to use the bathroom and stated I am so sorry It’s an emergency I have to use the bathroom. She stated you need to sit back in your seat the captain has asked we remain seated for 15 min. Also you can not stand here I need to pull the seats out for the crew members to be seated. I did what I was told and went to be seated. Not even 10 min later another women had walked to use the bathroom and nothing was said to her. We had no turbulence. So I then became very annoyed I was spoken to like that when I just had to use the bathroom. After the lady had came out I walked up and she had the cart to serve water the passengers out. I said excuse me so I can get in the bathroom. With no response. So I slightly just moved the cart so I can get to the bathroom since I have been waiting like I was told. She then replied don’t touch the cart I will move it. There is a way to talk to passengers and this was not it. She was extremely rude. Not sure if she had a bad day but I have never been talked to or treated like that with jet blue crew members.,1

He went above and beyond to help me find and courier my lost passport. I was stuck in America without my South African passport and very stressed.

2023-03-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Hartford,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,"never fly JetBlue"" ",True,  Worst experience with airline ever. Our flight on the way down to FL was delayed but only for an hour. The way back was a terrible. Delayed from 1 PM to 2 PM then to 5 PM. Jet Blue moved us to the 4:15 Flight and that was delayed then finally canceled. The only thing Jet Blue would do is move us to a next day flight and then they would not even guarantee that flight because it was full. At the boarding gate they were so swamped the recommended that we call on our cell phone. When we did that we got redirected to a third party site that told us they would reimburse our Jet Blue tickets at full cost and book up on American Airlines but we would have to pay another 554 dollars now and get reimbursed later. After getting to the TPA airport expecting to get home at 4:00 PM EST we ended up not getting in until 1:00 AM the next day. After seeing only an 83 dollar reimbursement per ticket from Jet Blue I called just for Jet Blue to say we only get less than 1/4 of our tickets costs because it is cheaper to from from TPA to BLD then the other way. They said the third party was a scam and they held no responsibility for us having to pay extra for the flight home. This was all due to Jetblues planes breaking down and JetBlue not helping out their customers at all. Save yourself a headache and never fly JetBlue.,-1

Near 3 hour flight delay meant I missed all my connecting flights. They didn't have enough crew then apparently didn't check the plane was working correctly during that over hour delay and so we had another over hour delay. Jetblue would not help at all. They all seemed to agree I deserved compensation for the problems they caused me such as food voucher and hotel but they all said they couldn't do it themselves. In person staff said I had to do it online. Online said Jetblue in the airport had to do it. I showed them the messages from online and they said too bad. I asked online what to do now and who could I talk to, they also said too bad. They literally just abandoned me in NYC. I will curse their name to everyone who will listen for the rest of my life.

I have to say that I am super disappointed with the services policies offered. First disappointment was that they charge for a check in bag. Who goes on a vacation abroad without a checked in bag? Ridiculous! Second disappointment was that they do not provide any complimentary meal. It doesn't have to be a full meal course like a rel  airline company does but at least provide a small meal/sandwich or something to hold you off on the 4 hours or more flights. Most international flights I have done (using international airlines, of course) provide that. At JFK airport, during the return, while awaiting for the customs, JetBlue did change the flight gate from one end to the other end, and did not notify the passenger that were at the customs, and the time between customs and the flight were cutting short, and passenger could end up missing the flight, having only minutes to make to the gate. That created a huge level of stress and frustration and this type of service is unacceptable.",-1
2023-03-12,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to New York JFK,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3,The plane is tiny,False,"  Decent seat size, In flight complimentary meal, drinks and snacks. Selection of films/movies/ live tv to watch. Nice staff. The plane is tiny. I personally wouldn’t care about this except for the fact that the turbulence is horrendous.  My partner vomited several times due to how rocky and up and down the plane was going. An aircraft that small would be fine for a 1-2 hour flight, but not London to New York. The smaller the plane the more you will feel the wind and turbulence. Because of how bad the turbulence was the seat belt sign was kept on the entire 7 hour flight barring one time in which the entire plane (understandably) rushed to go to the toilet. There was no word or explanation from the pilot as to why the turbulence was so severe or even an update as to when it may calm down. The air stewards just went along like nothing out of the ordinary was happening whilst simultaneously being thrown around the aisle trying to control the drinks trolley that was being shaken like mad. Take off and landing we’re genuinely terrifying.  I will say that the flight home to London from New York was smoother, and the pilot  communicated over the speaker advising when there was turbulence and how long roughly it would last. So that was the plane, the customer service was very odd also. After the horrendous flight to NYC as soon as we got to our hotel I phoned jetblue customer service to ask about if there was anything we could do on the flight home to make it less inconvenient for other passengers when he would inevitably be sick again (not nice for people to see/hear). The lovely lady told me she would him move free of charge to a disabled/extended leg room seat that hadn’t been booked which was sat closer to the toilet and had a bit more room incase he was going to be sick again he wouldn’t be stuck in a tight row next to anyone. I was over the moon as it meant he would feel less embarrassed and hopefully less people would have to see him vomit. When I go to check in online on the morning of our flight I see the seat hasn’t changed, so I phone jetblue and they say yes you can have the seat but it’ll cost $100! I said the lady I spoke to said it would be FOC and she already reserved the seat and they said sorry she must’ve got it wrong and she isn’t allowed to do that - how do their staff not know what to do? So we go to the airport (jfk) and find the JetBlue help desk and explain to the lady there the situation, she thankfully says that’s no problem I’ve assigned you both the extra leg room seats for not extra cost and have made a note on your ticket that a wheelchair will be available back at Gatwick should he get very sick on the plane and need some assistance getting off. Thank god we spoke to the help desk (which shows they definitely did not need to charge us an extra $100) and got it sorted. I will say we had no delays, everything was on time.",-1

2023-03-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to St Maarten,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,JB would be my last option,False," First, don’t thanks us for choosing your airline, it was just the better time departure or arrival. If I had a choice JB would be my last option. This airline is ALWAYS DELAYED, DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM, delayed flight due to bad weather in NYC, when I called friends flying with different airlines at the same time were able to land in NYC, had to stay in hotel and rebook another flight in the AM. Not refundable because weather issue, right. Another flight delayed for 6 hours. Then today, getting to airport 2 hours before flying to St Maarten, trying to get my baggage checked with no success and got refused boarding 1.30 minutes because we are late. Never happened in 20 years traveling international. It looked like the plane was overbooked, I could not select a seat and ruin my vacations having to rebook my whole trip again. They do not care about customer service, they are here to grab every penny they can. DO NOT SUPPORT THEM.",-1
2023-03-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LaGuardia to Charleston,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,Horrible customer service,True,"  Never fly Jetblue. Horrible customer service. The 2 staff ladies at the gate are very very rude and derogatory. There was some confusion about “mosaic” status. It shows up on my account/app/website, but was not included in the booking. So they charged me an extra $65 at the gate for my carry-on bag (I purchased base fare but mosaic can ring carry-on regardless fare type). The lady was so rude, asked me step aside, doesn’t listen to my explanation, talk loudly over me and said “You need to give me your credit card for the charge, otherwise you can sort this out and take the next flight” I was shocked and angry and upset about how she treats me. I have my mosaic status through my corporate benefit. Maybe she thinks I’m lying because I look like a student? When I reached out to customer support later, they didn’t offer any refund or apologies. I asked to send my screenshot of my account. They said there’s no way they can receive a screenshot through email or chat. It’s just absurd. So I ended up having to pay $65 for a carry-on bag? I mean if I know I’m not mosaic anymore (if it doesn’t show up on my account), why would I not book a normal fare that allows carry-on??",-1

Finally boarded the flight and then they notified the passengers that they had no pilots for the flight. Sat on board with the rest of the unhappy passengers for another hour. I paid more to change to this flight to avoid weather and paid more in change fees that the original flight cost. I could not talk to anyone to make the change. Waited 2 hours in a chat que, to wait another hour and 52 minutes for the rep to make the changes. Never flying this airline again.",-1

Our flight was delayed over 7 hrs and had to change two planes. Initial flight time was 9am with that being said I was at the airport at 6 am with my husband and son (23 months). They kept changing our gates and flight didn’t come until 11am and started boarding us at 11:30. Finally we thought we are taking off soon but no apparently there was a safety issue and made us sit in the plane till 1:45 pm. Horrible experience ever. I would never travel with JetBlue again. My son was over tired and irritated made our travel experience exhausting. I also don’t recommend anyone to travel with JetBlue even my family has similar experiences in the past.,-1

They dragged it so late into the evening there were no other flights to get us to LA. JetBlue also could not get us there themselves for several days missing our vacation window entirely. When asked to refund our hotel reservations per their own policies they stated that due to it being cancelled for weather they are not obligated to give us reimbursement. Never trust a cheap airline. It's not worth it they will treat you like a cheap customer. Do the right thing JetBlue.,-1
2023-02-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Francisco,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,incredibly rude and unhelpful,True,"  I had the Most Miserable experience I have had in 20 years. I booked a flight to San Fran for $1,200. flight time at 5pm didn't board until 9pm get on plane and pilots timed out which means the pilots ran out of time to fly and have to rest. we needed to de-board the plane and the flight was moved to 2am and eventually cancelled. got on another flight that was supposed to leave at 9:30pm we didn’t board until 11pm. at 2am the pilots timed out again. All flights canceled. booked an Uber home to sleep. Still needing to get to San Francisco I booked a flight though ""partner"" AA for $1,700. Mosaic customer service said it wasn’t their problem and they could not book me on a American Airlines flight, So if i wanted to go i would have to pay the difference. My 2pm flight to JFK landed, we made it to the connecting flight in JFK 20 minutes early, but they closed the gates 10 minutes early making us miss the flight! They re-booked up for a 6:30pm flight and it is now delayed until 9pm! All JetBlue personnel have been incredibly rude and unhelpful, telling me “Too bad"". They said that I would get some sort of travel credit but now my business trip and plans are totally destroyed I have also lost my hotel reservations and will be stranded in San Fran at 1am in the morning! The Mosaic Customer care said they might issue some sort of travel bank credit in 7 days if they decide to review the flight. I am distraught at the level of disrespect I have been treated with by all of the JetBlue personnel and the unprofessionalism that has transpired.",-1

I booked outbound flights with American and return flights with JetBlue. Little did I know, I had paid a no carry on fee for the latter so upon leaving I learned that I my carry on would not be accepted. I had to spend another $200 on upgraded seats just to take my carry on on two flight segments. I was also met with rude staff at the gate in Fort Lauderdale who seemed annoyed that I was late (due to the prior JetBlue flight being delayed) because they would have to open the jet at again etc. Very rude and unprofessional service. I’ve never been forced to pay more for seats to bring a carry on! I will stick with United, Delta and American for work and pleasure!",-1

It's the little things that matter and the flight attendant on board was one of the nicest people ever and I appreciate the free beer more than I can explain. Says so much, and he shook my hand and genuinely told me I'm sorry for your loss and I know he meant it. Amazing airline and people working for it you got my business for life Jetblue",1
2023-02-17,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Cancun,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,Met my expectations in every way,False," Met my expectations in every way. I am not a frequent traveler, but I look for comfort and efficient service. Takeoff and landing were both smooth and we didn't hit any turbulence during our flight. The seat was comfortable, but the button to recline was stuck. Luckily I had a lot of leg room (I'm 5'3"") and was comfortable the entire flight. The windows were dirty and there was probably a kid sitting there before me, but I also can't expect the staff to wipe each window between flights. I love that the snacks are free and I fully take advantage by grabbing one of each thing. The staff was quick and efficient with in-flight service, and super friendly each time we interacted. The back of seat tv had a ton of movies and tv shows to choose from and I purchased a set of wired earbuds to watch an old favorite. I was happy with this flight and after taking a different airline back, Jetblue is much better. I purchased through a third party site and I think I got a great deal and had many time options to choose from. Taking away two stars because of the dirty windows and seat that wouldn't recline. Otherwise it met my expectations: I arrived at my destination safely and had a comfortable trip.",1

Today Feb 15,2023 my flight from MCO to BOS has been delayed for smell of oil in the cabin. It never fails that there is a problem with this airline.

2023-02-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Boston,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They have degraded to Spirit quality,False,"  I am still upset by the disregard shown when JetBlue changed the destination airport from Boston to Worcester the morning before my return flight. Worcester is 40 miles from my home, with no reasonable public transportation to my home, and a LYFT from there would have been extremely expensive. I had to change to a flight getting in at almost midnight, and couldn't use Public Transportation at that late hour either, incurring another $65 that I could have saved coming in at the original time of 7:30pm. The flight changing was a hassle, taking me 40 minutes to complete. Nowhere on their customer bill of rights is there any mention of what passengers rights are when the airline decides to change you destination to a place 40 miles from your target. They were unsympathetic. Unrelated, I have to say I was also alarmed that the desk personnel did not look at any of the scanned border passes as we boarded. Anyone could have been on that flight. JetBlue was a wonder when it was started. They have degraded to Spirit quality and I won't use them again. I wish I could let them know, but they don't want to hear from their customers.",-1

I had to cancel a flight due to an accident. I spent all day today trying to rebook -- their online form would not accept my info; they charge $25 just to call them; I chatted with someone, got shuttled to a call center in India; and then back to someone else, who -- after 5 or 6 hours of this -- ""sweetly"" told me that no, I could not rebook. Interminable wait times.. NO ONE told me my ticket was too old to redeem. It should have been relayed to me in the first interaction. Moreover, the website says nothing about it either. When we got our cancellation email, they did not say we had only one year to redeem, just that they would be there when we wanted to use the tickets. After literally 6 HOURS working on this, I found out they were keeping our $700.",-1

I had gotten a credit due to COVID traveling restrictions. It was expiring on 10/20/2022. So, I called customer service for an extension. I was told no more extensions are given but I can book to hold the value of the money and keep changing it and extending or give it a relative. I did just that. Booked 2 tickets to London from JFK for 6/2023. By January, we decided we wanted to go to Caribbeans for family vacay. I call them to make changes. I was flat out denied or I will be charged fee. Their misleading website indicated I can cancel my flight to get travel credit. So, I did. THAT, completely messed me up and my credit had expired, somehow. ~$2000 gone to JetBlue without any service. Nothing but rip-off. Very disappointed.",-1

I accepted and took the later flight out but had to also change airport. Arrived home 5 hours later than was supposed to arrive with the original flight.

They said they could not get us to Florida or even back home for 5days. I was stranded as a single mom with two children in New York City with no where to go for 5 days. Their were no hotels because it was the week of New Years Eve and their were no rental cars that would allow a one way rental home to Missouri. I had saved for this vacation to Florida with my kids for two years. It was ruined but that I could deal with but the lack of accommodation to reimburse me with extra flying points is ridiculous. That is the very least they could do for putting me in a very dangerous situation with my children for five days with no vouchers for hotel or food. It was a terrifying experience. Shame on you JetBlue for not making it right and taking accountability.,-1
2023-01-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Newark,,,,,,,1,Customer service is pleasantly abysmal,False,"  JetBlue Customer Service personnel fabricate information that is not honored when attempting to use travel credits in 2023. Example- flight booked 9/21, cancelled 1/22 with original expiration date of 9/1/22. Called customer service 6/1/22, 8/1/22 and was told not to worry,the Sept expiration date extended to mid-Jan, 2023, call the Intra Dept use tckt. no. when calling. Extensive notes kept of call discussions. Attempting to book a new ticket in escalation to supervisor Valerie of Salt Lake City indicated- she's sorry you were told incorrect information, credits expired on the original date of 9/1/22. No accommodation whatsoever, out $194. Lesson Learned- all Jet Blue communication must be on email or in writing as their discussions are not honored. Customer service is pleasantly abysmal, with a rating of below zero. Confidence in the airline zero. Trust in the business below zero.",-1
2023-01-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Denver via Boston,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,do not fly JetBlue,True,"  Check in was not smooth, the website kept glitching while i was processing my check in on 12/26/22, also i purchased 4checked bags. On our way to the airport i looked at our tickets and the seats i had purchased for our family of 4 the night before were no longer listed on the ticket. The website was having “server issues” per the customer service operator i spoke with on 12/27/2022 in the morning hours. The agent over the phone advised me she couldn't help over the phone that we would need to speak with an agent at the check in counter. On arrival to the airport we went to the counter and were told to first print our tickets and bag tags at the kiosk and then they could assist. When we checked in at the kiosk it said only 1 bag was processed and that i had to purchase the additional 3. So i did. Finally tickets and bag tags printed. When we arrived at the JetBlue counter i spoke with the agent who was very helpful, she advised me that 7 bags were paid for, she mentioned they had been experiencing issues with the kiosk. We only had 4 bags, we only checked in 4 bags. She said she noted our account and to call JetBlue to get our $135 refunded since we did not have 7bags. We waited an additional hour to figure out the seats, she tried several methods to fix our seats since we were traveling with two little kids (4&5). After several phone calls she was told for us to go ahead and go through TSA that by the time we arrived in Boston for our connection our seats would be taken care of. While she was trying her best to help us, another agent came around and said to her “you’ll be here all day if you keep trying to help them”. To this she answered “sometimes we have to do the right thing”. I give her so much credit for actually trying her best to do her job the right way. They assured us we would be taken care of by the time we arrived in Boston with a final destination to Denver. We continued to our gate and boarded our first flight. On our arrival to Boston for our connecting flight not only dis we still not have seats but they had us and our son on a standby list and my daughter was the only one with a seat! My husband stood at the counter and talked to the agent endlessly until we finally got seats with our children. I would like to note our flights had been booked for 6 months, there was absolutely no reason we were being placed on a standby list. On our return home my husband contacted JetBlue to request a refund for the additional 3 bags we were wrongly charged for. We were advised the charge was non-refundable. Basically they are saying they took our money for 3 bags we didn't check in. If i can give any advise to anyone booking a flight, please save yourself the hassle and do not fly JetBlue.",-1

On our first flight from SFO to FLL the flight was delayed about an hour because it was coming from New York. The gate agent was super friendly and was helping people with a smile. She gave us extra reward miles for the inconvenience. On the plane, there was a self-serve bar with snacks and drinks, and you could take as many as you wanted. On our second flight, the flight attendant was very friendly and even went out of her way to give my son JetBlue wings. The wifi was free and very fast. The legroom was amazing and there were TVs on every seat. If you can, go on JetBlue.",1

Second time flight is delayed. 3 hour delay and 1 hour taxiing.. Unfortunately called customer service and they were extremely rude and would not give any credit on account, stating the delay was 2 hrs 56 minutes, even though we have proof it was a 3 hr delay. Looks like they like to alter their numbers. We are paying customers and deserve respect. Please retrain your staff and do better as a company.

The cancelled my partner’s flight on the way to New Orleans and couldn’t book him for another 3 days; they wouldn’t even direct him to another airline! Then they cancelled our flight back to New York, so we scheduled for the next day. They then delayed it another hour and a half. Ok, whatever. At the last minute they moved the flight up another 30 minutes, causing us to rush to the gates! Once we got there, they said they weren’t boarding yet! What a waste of time and money, this experience has made me never want to take another flight.",-1
2023-01-05,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Myers,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3,been a disappointment,True,"  Jetblue used to be my only choice for flying. For years it was the primary option with having Fly-Fi, Directv, assigned seating, and relatively low rates. But the past 2 times I've flown them have been a disappointment. Our family of 4 was flying from BOS to RSW round trip. In BOS our flight was delayed several times then an additional set of delays until the crew (who would not communicate why we were not boarding the flight) decided to inform everyone that the flight was oversold and would not board until someone volunteered to give up their seat. This happened several times before allowing us to board. In total it was a 5 hour delay from original itinerary. When we arrived in RSW no one brought the strollers and assistive devices to the jetway for at least 15 minutes after the flight was deplaned completely, leaving those who most need their equipment hanging. No one is more patient than a dozen toddlers and infants who just sat in a terminal for 5 hours and then flew 3 more hours. Luckily, it was a moot point as the crew took another hour to get the luggage to the carousel. On the return flight, it was delayed and then canceled the day of with no explanation. Called Jetblue to figure out other options and was told possibly the next day but we wouldn't be able to sit together. This isn't an option as we were flying with a 3 and 4 year old. We offered to drive from RSW to TPA, 2.5 hours a way to get a flight with seats together. That flight was also delayed an hour. When we landed in BOS there was a long taxing delay. We deplaned and no one unloaded the luggage for 2 hours from when we landed. Several of us parents were stuck on the jetway for 45 minutes because you can't pass through the ticketing agent because you aren't able to return through. We asked if anyone was bringing the assistive devices and the ticketing agent had no answer for anyone. After another 30 minutes they found a crew to unload the strollers. In total it was over 2 hours from deplaning to getting our belongings. Jetblue offered me four $50 travel bank credits to make up for the delays on the way and then 4 more on the way home. I signed up for the travel bank and got into it to only see one credit for $50 dollars and not the $400 they said I would receive. Also, their TrueBlue and Mosaic system is flawed and never records my flights. You call to try to get customer service and the wait time is 59 minutes. I think I am done with Jetblue. Also, Jetblue advertises having Fly-Fi and TVs and our entire row of TVs were completely non-functional and the Fly-Fi was out of service area for most of the flight. On the return flight 2 of our seats audio jacks were non functioning and one of our TV controls didn't work at all. In exchange for having zero entertainment options they offered an extra bag of cheese itz.",-1
2023-01-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to San Jose via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Customer service was horrible,True,"  Customer service was horrible. They made several changes to my route, so I changed the flight to one with a layover that made sense, and came with a $48 credit. However, because I paid for part of the ticket using a credit that has since expired, they said that the $48 credit I received for making this change was expired. The whole ticket was around $590, I paid for about $340 of that with a credit, and the other $250 on a credit card. I tried using JetBlue's chat feature, only to get told multiple times that the credit was expired, and no response when I asked why they were using the expired credit as a measure rather than the $250 new credit card purchase, as the credit I should have received was nowhere close to that amount. And then the customer service rep just ended the chat on me while I was typing a response to her latest 'credit is expired' BS. Part of me wants to pursue it further, but then if they do end up giving me the credit, that means I have to fly JetBlue again, and I don't think it's worth it.",-1

2022-12-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lima to Boston,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,The worst experience of my life,False,"  The worst experience of my life. As we get to Lima to go to our connecting flight they tell us the flight is so delayed that we won’t make it to our next flight in time. They then give a direct flight from Fort Lauderdale to Boston, which we were happy about, then we realized we will be in the airport for 8 hours, without being fed anything on any of the planes. We tried to change the flight when the help women just said “nope, there isn’t any other flights”. Doesn’t check. Then we get through security and see a flight we could have made for 11:45 instead of 5 pm. We were told we were gonna get a food voucher cause 8 hours without food plus not getting fed on the plane is disgusting. They gave us for lunch and dinner $12 USD. Will never be doing this again, completely ruined my trip and the New Year!",-1

After a 6.5 hour delay and counting, I need my medication from my checked bag. I guess since we're so late and they can't get my bad with medication, I will have to suffer.

2022-12-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,would rather I pay for a flight than use miles,False," Completely useless. For three days in a row I'm trying to book a flight with miles. Three days getting errors and the specific error is blocked by a pop-up. I'm building a website and I can say that JetBlue's website may as well have been designed by high school students. Doesn't pass the most basic quality tests. I suspect the ""error"" is that Jetblue would rather I pay for a flight than use miles. Now on hold for 20 minutes. If I were running Jetblue the Chief Technology Officer would be gone with immediate effect.",-1

Was rebooted (with A LOT of effort) from a cancelled non-stop to a route with a stop in FLL. The flight times have fluctuated wildly all day. Even as boarding approaches, they’ve run much later than posted. AND, there have been absolutely no announcements. We’re currently waiting on flight attendants, but say nothing if you don’t ask. JetBlue really failed me on this trip.",-1

2022-12-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Charleston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst customer service,True,"  Worst customer service I’ve ever experience in an airline that I trusted. I used to rave about how Jetblue what the best. Now, I feel, they are the worst. Grandfather died and we needed to make the trip on Christmas Day (today). They delayed the flight 3 times: we checked every 5 minutes on the status via the JetBlue app and email. All of the sudden, the app said the doors were closing one hour earlier than the last update earlier! We’d gotten some food and when we ran to the terminal the attendants wouldn’t let us on the plane. Customer service desk did nothing to help but put us on the waitlist. We were numbers 2 and 4. We finally get to the gate to the flight leaving 7 hours after our original departure and they moved us down the standby list to numbers 4 and 5. We missed the flight by one seat. The flight attendant checking people’s boarding passes actually gave a seat to a couple with a stroller crib “for their convenience.” Of that haven’t happened, we would’ve made it to my grandfather’s funeral and I would have gotten to see his (his body at least) one last time before they put him in his grave. Because of Jetblue, I did not. I will never forgive them for this.",-1
2022-12-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Buffalo,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Treat your customers with care and respect,True,"  This Christmas Buffalo NY, where I live, experienced probably the worst snow blizzard in history. My wife was supposed to fly with JetBlue from JFK to Buffalo on Dec 24. Her flight was cancelled, which was not a surprise. JetBlue website and app didn’t work but I managed to rebook using the customer care chat. She was now scheduled to fly from JFK to Rochester at 5:35 pm on Dec. 24. I was hoping to pick her up from there as soon as weather conditions permitted. She showed up at the airport at about 3 pm. After a long wait (crowds of people at the airport) she checked in and made it to the gate. JetBlue delayed the departure at least five times. At one point, the message to the passengers was that the plane had already arrived and only needed to be cleaned. But then … it disappeared. JetBlue must have prioritized another destination and decided to keep the Rochester passengers waiting. At 10:46 pm JetBlue delayed the departure until 12:56 pm. At 12:06 am on Dec 25 the flight was cancelled. After having spent nine hours at the airport my wife had to figure out how to get her luggage back and find a hotel for the night. It was a difficult day for US airlines; no doubt about it. Many flights across the US were cancelled. All the airlines faced major weather-related difficulties over Christmas. That is true. But my son was travelling with United at the same time. His flight was also cancelled, and he had to rebook it twice. But he could easily do this using the United app, the airport staff was available and helpful, and most importantly United got him to Rochester on Dec 24. United, in the face of crises, proved to be a much better airline than JetBlue. At the same time: - JetBlue seems to have had no idea where their planes were - There was no JetBlue staff at the airport to attend distressed passengers - JetBlue website was down - JetBlue app did not work - The wait time for the customer care chat was an hour - Customer care chat had no idea where the luggage was and advised to talk to the airport staff, that was nowhere to be found - The luggage return was a mess with suitcases damaged and piling up. My wife is not a young and strong person. After having spent nine hours at JFK terminal 5, which is now a comfortable place to be, her physical and mental state were terrible. JetBlue provided no assistance. The airline refunded the ticket. But it is not enough. JetBlue put my wife’s health in danger and showed no care. Treat your customers with care and respect that they deserve.",-1
2022-12-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Ponce,,,,,,1.0,1,Worst airline experience ever,True,"  JetBlue cancelled our flight at the gate, minutes after we were supposed to take off. No explanation was given, and the abundant personnel at the airport were clueless, rude, and condescending. Their remote ""customer service"" was even worse. They took over 6 hours to get me to a chat. The clueless staff at the other end would take over 10 minutes responding to my chat message. But when I waited 10 seconds to respond to the chat, it dropped me off. Worst airline experience ever.",-1
2022-12-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Liberia to Boston,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,JetBlue communicated terribly,True,"  JetBlue is a very disorganized airline. Our plane was canceled while we were waiting for it at the airport. Jet Blue handed the cancelation miserably. Initially they told us to wait a minute while they looked for a hotel for us. After 4 hours of numerous wait ""one minute"" comments, they told us we were all set. A Jet Blue employee helped us through customs and so on, then left us outside the airport without a hotel. We went back to the ticket counter, and they told us they couldn’t help us despite acknowledging that our plane had been canceled. They told us another airline also had flights just canceled (after ours) and that airline had booked all the hotel rooms. I’ve been on many airlines and have had numerous cancelations. All other airlines handled the cancelation reasonably well. Yes, sometimes I had to wait hours, but the other airlines were always polite and communicated clearly. JetBlue communicated terribly and left us in a foreign country at the airport curbside with nowhere to say. We were able to book a place to stay, but the cost was on us and had the headaches of figuring out how to do that when we didn’t speak the language. I wish I was on the American Airlines that had their flight canceled hours after us as I believe American picked up the tab for the hotel and helped the travers get to the hotel. Stay away from Jet Blue.",-1
2022-12-24,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to New Orleans,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4,extremely disappointed in JetBlue,True,"  Jetblue use to be a great airline, however, they’ve clearly decided to put money over customers. Tacking on fees here and there for everything as if this was a spirit or frontier flight. They have great seating on the planes and great inflight entertainment but these new tickets and extra fees for bags is ridiculous. They say they’re giving you options, but is this really options or Just another way to beef up their pockets. My flight was delayed over two hours and the customer service representative refused to do anything to try and make it right. I’m extremely disappointed in JetBlue and I will think twice about booking a B6 flight in the future.",1

2022-12-20,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Aruba,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,very unprofessional and unrespectful,True,"  I fly with my mother on December 14th to Aruba from New York JFK. The flight was at 7 am. We did the check in on the machines and when going to drop the luggages on the luggage drop, the guy in charge was beyond rude to both of us. First, we asked him help on how to put the luggage tag, to what he replied:” its not my problem if you don't know how to read the instructions”, which was not the case, we just were confused, in a rush, and trying to get it right faster. After that he asked us for the ED CARD, when asking him what that was, he replied “you will not be flying to Aruba today” . I then asked him if this was something we could complete right away at the airport before taking the flight, and he just replied “get out of the line”. Now, I understand we were not well prepared but this positions require good customer service and every single passenger deserves some human dignity and respect. It is very unprofessional and unrespectful to give this kind of answers to customers. We did mange to get all done and fly but the treatment was completely unnecessary.",-1
2022-12-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,was more than an hour delayed,True," Worse experience ever whenever possible I will always try to avoid Jetblue. First, just to check in my bag me and my daughter waited outside on line forever as staff was slow, inefficient and limited and it was soo freezing that we ended up with a cold. The inside machines were not working. Then I am TSA pre but somehow it did not appear on my ticket so I did the regular line and let me tell you, OMG I have never seen in my life a line like this. Literally a snake line that was barely moving and so long that it was impossible not to lose mine and others flight. The hysterical thing is that TSA pre line was barely anything and even worse is that there were lots of check in kiosk that were not operative, so basically Jetblue was completely understaffed. Moral is that most of the people in line lost their flight so to make your flight happen you had to be at the airport at least 4 hours before the departure hour, this just because Jetblue is the most unorganized company ever. Also there were few poor old men that were extremely tired of waiting and not able to stand so long, most kept trying to skip the lines but we were all late no matter what flight it was. Oh and I made it to get my flight just because Jetblue was more than an hour delayed good for me but come on there is not one right thing about Jetblue. Great job Jetblue for being the worse flying company ever.",-1
2022-12-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,New York JFK to Denver,,,,,,1.0,1,employees are unbelievably rude,True,"  JetBlue employees are unbelievably rude and fall on the border of harassment. I have never experienced such a poor experience with their employees at JFK airport check-in desk. Essentially, I wasn’t allowed to board my flight and had no guarantee of a refund after denying my service animal (when I had all the paperwork / registered him prior). They gave me no legitimate reason for why we wouldn’t be let on the plane other than it was “against guidelines”. I experienced yelling, screaming, and child-like mocking from their hot-heated employees and have never experienced anything like it from any airline. It almost seemed like they had a prior stigma about me before even speaking to them. For the love of god, please save your time, energy and money from Jet Blue. JetBlue - you need to seriously think about who you’re hiring or restructure your customer service employees. I will never fly this airline again. Truly put a damper on my holiday plans!",-1

No reason announced. Landed 45 min late. It was raining. Another 10 min wait to open the door. I told the crew I am going to miss my connection flight. I had 2 hrs in between. No reaction. They did nothing. After leaving a plane I couldn’t enter the customs area for 20 min. I was told there is no space. While a couple who had global entry was allowed to enter customs with no issue. I had to pick up my luggage and check it in again, but was told that my next plane left. I was told to walk with a suitcase to next terminal in rain to get to JetBlue desk. The JetBlue crew showed zero empathy. They refused to look for another flight and said next jetblue is in the morning forcing me to take overnight hotel. They gave me a hotel that had no shuttle in the morning to get back to the airport. Hotel told me I have to call a taxi and the file for reimbursement. I spent 4 hours on all of it. Each time when calling jetblue waiting 15 min on hold to even speak to an agent. I am totally confused and lost any desire to travel anywhere. This is totally unacceptable customer service.  No support if something happens. Slow response. They don’t care.",-1
2022-12-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Aruba,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,JetBlue was absolutely terrible to fly with,False,"  Both ways, JetBlue was absolutely terrible to fly with. I was not allowed to board my departure flight because the flight was to leave at 7:20 and we arrived at 6:00am. We may have been able to board if we weren’t told by a random employee at the line to fill out ED cards (4 forms for each family member, 2 of them minors - a three year old and a 2 year old). We had to go all the way on the other side of the terminal to reschedule our flight. Anyone would be upset in this situation and instead of “we apologize for the inconvenience. Security checks are a long process here,” I get, “your itinerary says you need to be here 3 hours in advance (booked through Expedia, and it did not). Listen to what I’m saying instead of this temper tantrum you’re throwing right now.” Imagine that with 2 little children. On top of that, ED cards weren’t even verified. They had the previous flight number on them so basically, they are just a waste of time. My husband had an expired green card and a letter from the USCIS saying he could travel. It took 15 mins + to verify that this letter was acceptable (meanwhile in Aruba, there was no issue). Boarding passes were printed with no seats for my family so when it was boarding time, the representative at the gate was left searching for seats. I was worried we weren’t going to be able to board. I was then told that I needed to do this from home to make it easier. Well, I tried to check-in from home but, there is no option to enter a green card number at home. Thank goodness I didn’t have to reschedule my flight again. All I can say is, JetBlue you need to make life easier. I hope you learn from this review and get your act together because you really have a bad rap for a reason.",-1
2022-12-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to New York,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,They cancelled last minute,True," Jet Blue emailed us 5 times saying our flight had been delayed until, finally, they cancelled the flight which originally was supposed to leave at 11:30pm. They cancelled last minute and they didn’t have any other flights available that we could use. We had hotel reservations that had to be postponed last minute, we lost money on Broadway tickets that we couldn’t attend and I had to pay a lot more for a last minute ticket from another airline. Jet Blue refused to give us any kind of compensation, it’s the worst airline I have ever had any contact with. Will not buy any tickets from them again.",-1

My pregnant wife & I were removed from a flight because we would not accept a terrible flight attendant's rude & inappropriate behavior. Jetblue refused to compensate us, even according to their own published standards, as we were delayed overnight & nearly 12 hours. Shame on this once terrific company. A flight attendant basically yelled at me & incorrectly told me I had to place my paid for carry-on item at my feet, as a personal item. Then he refused to move aside & allow my pregnant wife to sit down. Then as mentioned above, he had us removed for abusing him.",-1

Great leg room which is very important as I am 6.3. Very good service and they paid attention to the extra details.

The self-check-in machines were only printing 1 checked luggage tag. Therefore, if you couldn't get the machine to print a second tag, you had to go a make an overcrowded line at the counter. I think it would have been easier for them to put 1 staff to help customers with the printing of tags in the machines. I have never seen JetBlue at SJU operating so poorly. Only the individual that was taking the checked luggage showed a good customer services out the few others that were there. It was a terrible experience.",-1

Meaning we missed our 3 hour layover in Florida. Our next flight was not available until 2 days later. We finally make it. Now on our way back the plane is delayed an hour and a half because the plane “was too heavy,” everything is weighed out before you fill the plane so I’m assuming they lied. So on the way back we run to the boarding gate and the lady at the counter closes the doors and says she can’t open them. We could see the plane still docked. So we had to go back to the counter and they tried putting us on a flight a day later. We cancelled and are awaiting our refund which they should. They cost us 2 days of vacation and money to fly a different airline. I used to love JetBlue enough to even own stock, not anymore, they went real down hill.",-1

We flew out of Logan Airport in Boston on JetBlue. Needed to check in with customer service the agent took my passport card and helped us through the process. We boarded our flight only to arrive in Aruba to find out they do not accept passport cards only passport books. I take some responsibility for not doing my due diligence but I also feel the JetBlue associate should of been also aware since they routinely fly out of Boston to Aruba. When I got to Aruba after waiting in the customs line forever. The customs agent/ Airport employee lost his mind and caused a scene regarding my US passport card. Then the nightmare began the treated us like we were international drug dealers. Treated rudely and presented a hostile environment. We are 2 middle age women in a foreign country we were scared and shaken. No one cared they separated us and did not allow us to see each other. They then ""perp"" walked us through the airport through 3 security check points to put us back on a full plane of angry passengers that were required to wait for us. What a horrifying, traumatic experience.",-1

I'll rather pay a little more than fly with JetBlue. They already delayed my flight two times without notifying their customers. It's totally wasting my precious time so if you're okay with waiting 4-5 hours in the airport just to ride JetBlue, go for it.

The flight overall was great but there was one flight attendant who was quite rude. I had purchased a hot coffee and a small bottle of Baileys for an extra $10 and I wanted to take my time drinking it. The flight attendant came by only after 10 minutes to take trash and insisted that I throw my coffee out. I found it extremely weird because I’ve been flying for years and never had someone wait there until I threw out my drink. I told her I was still working on it and she still persisted that we were going to be landing soon. I burned my mouth trying to chug down hot coffee and threw out half a cup still full. I know it wasn’t a long flight but you should let people finish what they pay for.,1

When I went to desk to check luggage the JetBlue attendant told me I did not had to pay for carry on because once I took the more space option the carry on was part of deal. The attendant then destroy the luggage tickets I had n printed new tickets. He told me to call JetBlue to request a refund . Upon my return home on October 18 after a horrible delay JetBlue flight I call jet blue to inquire about my luggage refund. A representative stated several times that luggage money was not refundable. I ask to speak to a supervisor as she refuse to give at least a credit. She put the call on hold to get a supervisor.

The staff was the rudest I have encountered in all of my years of traveling. I will never fly with this airline again. Terrible customer service which also concerns me for the safety of their airline due to not paying attention to what is going on around them.

We was waiting 1 day in the airport for the luggage because the JetBlue crew member in Punta Cana suggest us to wait for the luggage, when the luggage didn't came he was disrespectful, laughed at us, and didnt gave us any service. I still cant believe i got such a bad service from a JetBlue staff, yesterday evening the lost-luggage department told us that they will deliver the luggage to us at night, Of course that they didn't do that, and today we got a mail who told us that the luggage arrived to Punta Cana. When we called them, they still didn't knew where is the luggage, and lied us that they gonna deliver it before the wedding, so today we had the wedding without our suits and cloth, we called to the luggage department and they hanged off the phone. We are on a vacation for 2 days without clothes, our wedding was destroyed, and we still don’t know where our luggage is. We expect a compensation and to get our luggage immediately!",-1

Was told the flight was not refundable but I would be issued a credit. Credit however did not include Taxes and fees, prepaid checked baggage, or seat upgrades. So out of over $1,622 I got a credit for $876. That credit could not be used for checked bags or seat upgrades on another flight. They nickel and dime you and then rip you off. AVOID JETBLUE!",-1

Spoke with an online agent who said I’d be refunded the full amount. When I went to the counter to verify this the agent was less than helpful. Said he could not verify this and offered nothing for the inconvenience. I did ask for a food voucher or something and he just said that they’d offer snacks once we boarded. Terrible experience!,-1

They put me up in a hotel and had a flight arranged the following day. Well they screwed something up at the hotel and I was charged for it. Now JetBlue refuses to reimburse me the full amount that was charged to my credit card,-1
2022-10-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Aruba,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worthless company and customer experience,False," BUYER BEWARE with JetBlue Airlines. I am truly just wishing I never made a reservation with them. I had a pandemic related travel credit that I have been repeatedly trying to use and getting one useless extension after another. The limitations on travel credit for JB are you can only use it for travel to JB hub (which there are a limited number of). Had a conference come up in the Caribbean - wound up using my credit to attend and a few months before JB cancelled their flight that day changing their departure to a day later causing me to miss my conference. Had to change airlines at significant expense due to late reservation. Now I still had the useless JB credit. Next I had a Florida Keys vacation come up. Perfect. The Keys are a destination on the JB website. Went to check out. No option to use credit. No explanation. Another long attempt to reach a human (never happens) and finally am told can’t use the credit as they use a partner airline to get to the Keys. Fast forward now, finally after a few weeks of research decided to make a trip to NYC solely to use the credit (that’s how useless it was - couldn’t fly anywhere I wanted to go). Made the reservation. Paid online. Got the final splash page confirming my reservation (locator number given) with dates and times stating expect an email conversation. Started making hotel reservations. The next day - all kinds of hotel confirmations. Still nothing from JetBlue. I log in - and it says my reservation was “canceled.” Not by me. Called JB - can’t get a human. Go through their long text and wait process - AGAIN - and given explanation: “It looks like the ticket did not process so the reservation was canceled.” What an explanation. Spent an hour and finally have reservation confirmed. Let’s see if it is cancelled. Worthless company and customer experience. I will never willingly agree to subject myself to the JetBlue Experience again.",-1

Rude attendants at the gate. I had medications & food which I needed prior to get in the plane. Came in very early. I was dropped off four hours earlier than my departure. I did not Check in my carry on thinking I can check in by gate. The charge for checking carry on was $35 but when I get to the gate they charged me $65. The staff were rude. They keep pointing to the boarding pass that you are not supposed to have a carry on and giving you a dirty look. They charge me $65 and very pleased with it. The attendant said That I could wait to take a flight at midnight if I wish to go and check the bag downstairs. Oh sure. How pleasant. Last time flying with this airline.,-1
2022-10-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Saint Lucia to New York JFK via Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,customer service is absolutely deplorable,True," We had a connector flight through JFK that we were advised we were going to miss and had to rebook due to Fiona in our flight path. We were told we would not get a flight out until the following day at 6am. We asked about vouchers, food, accommodations, putting us on another flight, even potentially cancelling as we could rent a car and drive home from JFK. We were advised that all of this would be taken care of when we arrived to JFK. After several hours we finally landed at JFK. We were made to gather all of our checked baggage and directed to terminal 5 only to find the entire terminal is closed. Lights off, no agents, nothing but sad elevator music playing, completely closed down. People wandered around hopelessly looking for someone to aid them with information and there were no agents manned to the terminal, only airport employees who clearly could not assist us properly. They didn't even know when the next person would be in, at 11pm when we're realizing this issue they told us we could expect someone ""maybe around 2 am, we're really not sure."" Not that I'd expect them to truly know, they don't work for JetBlue. Because we were made to take our checked luggage we could not pass through security so we were forced to remain in the open public area until who knew for how long. Again, no one to talk to us about anything, food vouchers, accommodations, not even a bottle of water. There weren't even chairs to sit in, only the cold hard tile. People were breaking wheelchairs out of their carrousels to let the senior citizens have a place to sit. My husband now completely triggered by this commotion (PTSD military war vet) found us the safest corner to hole up in, took some clothes out of our luggage and did the best he could to make ourselves comfortable. It was absolutely freezing and I was literally sickened with anxiety and exhaustion. Again, attempting to reach an agent through customer service or chat was simply impossible. Wait times that would take us up to boarding time were clearly not helpful. One of JetBlue's agents did not arrive until 3 am and no one still advised us of food vouchers or anything to assist us. They allowed us to re-check our bags and pass through to our departure gate, where we at least had chairs to sit on and carpeting. Accessible food and water (of our own cost). The customer service we received and frankly are still receiving is absolutely deplorable. To be quite literally just dumped and left stranded without any assistance is in my humble opinion shameful. Delays are to be expected, times are tough, we even understand staff shortages, Covid, all of that; but there is no excuse for the lack of customer service, plain humanity and care that was so blatantly missing here. I finally reached out directly to the President of JetBlue through LinkedIn and she directed my claim to one of her executives. We were met with no recognition of their wrong doing, given a bunch of excuses for why they were closed with links about why we would not have received any assistance if there were anyone there anyway and then offered airline credits for our troubles. Why on earth would that be acceptable? I will never fly with this airline again! Offering credits with a deadline to use them by when one is clearly upset with your service is despicable! We may be just a drop in their financial bucket for but I will continuously share our experience through reviews and social media and book with any other airline from now on!",-1
2022-10-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly JetBlue again,True,  JetBlue has just taken 7 hours of my life and I want it back.

I will never fly JetBlue again.,-1
2022-10-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Horrible experience,True,"  The plane was delayed 6 hours. Every other airline carrier was flying out of Fort Lauderdale no problem except JetBlue. They charge you $35 for your carry on back. Horrible experience. I always fly Delta, just because I worked late and wanted to sleep in I messed up my whole Sunday and my whole Monday. I have to drive two hours after I get to Fort Lauderdale. I took a plane where I could drive on daytime but now I have to drive the everglades at night. Worse decision I ever made. It is not a one off event, they are late 40% of the time. Don't make the same mistake and do not fly with jetblue.",-1
2022-10-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minnesota to Miami,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,The most horrible airline,False,"  The most horrible airline ever! My husband and I had a reservation flight from Minneapolis, Minnesota to New York and from there to Miami, Florida where we had a cruise leaving early in the morning. They canceled our connecting flight from New York to Miami and instead told us we had to get to West Palm Beach which is an hour away and “figure it out.” We arrived at New York at 10am and this new flight was leaving at 8:45p. They made us go through TSA multiple times and each time they would throw away a new item of ours. They would continuously single us out and check us. We only had the boarding pass without a gate number and a seat number and when we were finally given one, we were seated in totally different seats. There attitudes was horrid and one agent said, while my husband and I were trying to figure out the boarding pass to give, “what do you think this is?.” The most horrible airline I’ve ever flew with and will never ever make that mistake again! Disgusting",-1
2022-10-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,1,will never fly with them again,True,"  My wife and I were flying from EWR to MCO for a 1 week vacation which was booked 3 months in advance. The night of the flight the aircraft experiences some sort of maintenance issue and needs to be checked out. We sit around for hours and eventually are pulled off of the plane due to it not being able to be resolved. My issue is that due to this, we are out a night at our hotel that was already paid for and now we have to pay extra transportation costs to get to and from the hotel due to showing up at 3-4 AM when the car rental agency is closed. Jetblue staff told us to reach out to customer service, who then told us there's nothing that can be done and we just have to deal with it. I was a long time customer with Jetblue but after this experience will never fly with them again. Stay away unless you want to get to your destination late and pay double doing so, all while",-1

2022-09-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to New York,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,hides behind their customer bill of rights,True,"  Jetblue hides behind their customer bill of rights, but its more like a lack of rights for their customers. My flight was delayed 3 hours and 40 minutes and they pretty much said, oh well all you can get is a $50 credit - as if I want to fly with them again. When I finally got on the plane it was filthy. I wiped off the seat with a Clorox wipe and could not get the gunk off.",-1

I missed my flight to Boston with this connecting flight. I got home a 1:45am the next day. Had to call out of work because of the terrible service. I was at the airport from Friday 5am to Saturday 1:45 next day. JetBlue just apologize and dismiss my complaint because I do not matter.,-1
2022-09-26,0.3,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,New York to San Juan,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,nothing but problems,False,"  My husband and I were scheduled to fly out on the 18th to the 23rd of September. We were previously going on the 9th but due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to delay our trip. But I digress, the 18th was the hurricane and JetBlue pushed us back to the 20th but not extending our stay for 2 days. They shortened my trip. I waited for over 2hrs daily to speak or chat with someone to make sure that everything was a go for the additional 2 days that we lost, but it wasn’t. I called the hotel to make sure that they had power and we were all set. I finally get to my destination and the hotel tells me that they thought I was a no-show and I did not have a reservation. I flew for 4hrs and this is what I hear. I had to call JetBlue while I was there so they can speak to someone to let them know that I did have a reservation. Because the hotel couldn’t reserve the reservation from a 3rd party on the same day, I had to pay for the 1st night. JetBlue is supposed to refund the money. They tell me it will be in a credit. Who says that I will be using them again? I was very lucky that there was a room available that fit what I wanted. I was supposed to have the continental breakfast because that’s what I chose for my initial trip but that didn’t happen. So, I had to pay more money just to eat breakfast which was $76.00 per day after the “$150.00” VIP perk was used up. I paid for the extra legroom but then both ways, the internet did not work, and we couldn’t watch the DIRECT TV on board. What is the point of having it if you can’t use it. This trip should have been for leisure but going and coming was nothing but problems. I know weather is not their fault but since there were so many issues going and coming there should be some sort of incentive. I am angry and frustrated because I was almost in a strange place away from home with no place to stay because JetBlue did not do their due diligence.",-1
2022-09-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Juan,,,,,,1.0,1,customer service was horrific,True,"  I spend a very large amount of money on very overpriced plane tickets. I paid extra on top of that in order for them to be fully refundable. I received an email confirming this from JetBlue stating that my ticket is fully refundable and will be refunded in the original form of payment if cancelled. I am less then 2 weeks away from my travel date and the island I am traveling to has been hit with a hurricane and is being evacuated so I am no longer able to go. I cancelled my flight and received a refund through travel points rather then to my bank account so I called customer service to fix this. After waiting 65 minutes to get in contact with someone on the phone he was of no help. Told me I was incorrect and by the end of the telephone call he specifically told me that I was ""wasting his time"" but he ""will continue to repeat himself to me for as long as I want"" and that he could do that all day. The customer service was horrific and I have never had to end a service phone call on terms like that. It was extremely disrespectful. On top of that the amount of false advertisement on the JetBlue website referring to refunds is unbelievable. It is apparently just an easy way to get extra money out of you with no intention to follow through with what those additional fees are actually for.",-1

2022-09-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Boston,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,they showed absolutely no regard for the people who were left stranded,False,"  We flew JetBlue for the first part of our journey to India. We were supposed to fly from Raleigh Durham to Boston and connect at Boston to Qatar Airways which would take us to India. Our RDU-BOS flight was scheduled to depart at 5:30pm and land at 7:30pm giving us three hours to make our international connection in Boston. The flight was delayed from 5:30 to 6:30, and then repeatedly until the flight only took off at 8:30. During this time, absolutely no explanation was given for their delay. There were 22 total passengers in this flight looking to make the same connection. When we landed in Boston at 10pm, JetBlue said there were 15 minutes in which we could make our connection (scheduled to take off at 10:15) and asked that these 22 people be allowed off the plane first, however, we then sat on the tarmac for one full hour, with no gate available. At 11:30 when we got a gate (note that by this time, we had watched the plane we were supposed to be on taxi by our JetBlue window and take off - they had tried waiting for 30 minutes), there was no jet bridge available to allow everyone to deplane. JetBlue was not only deeply incompetent in this situation, they showed absolutely no regard for the people who were left stranded in Boston at midnight. There were families with children and elderly people traveling alone. No JetBlue employee was available to help people get a hotel room overnight or find out where their checked luggage might be. When we tried to reach customer service, for chat, the delay to speak to someone was 1 hour and 20 minutes and thirty minutes by phone. We are never flying JetBlue again.",-1

I have been traveling all around the world with many different International and Domestic airlines. I make it very simple. Constant cancellation. Their representatives at airports, especially JFK are extremely rude, and unprofessional. They refuse to provide assistance to the passengers who are stuck at airports due to cancelations.

I was on my way home from laying my mother to rest. I was frustrated with the agent who checked me in, and then had to go through double security and sit in a sectioned of area until boarding. Upon ending the plane one of the attendant remembered me from my trip down some days earlier. Seeing my frustration he asked what was wrong. I explained. After that the entire crew took care of my family and I. I rank their hospitality among the best I have ever encountered while flying. Natalie, Eddy Shondel and Lenny. You guys deserve awards for the tremendous care and compassion you showed. Knowing that we were hurting from our loss of our loved one. You went above and beyond the call of duty. This can never be repaid. I just want to extend the warmest thank you to you all from the bottom of my heart.",-1

Please train your flight attendants to be a bit more accommodating to families with crying infants in flight. Talk about no compassion towards a hungry baby. All we needed was a cup of water to mix formula for our hungry baby, but this New York base crew refused to provide any service until we had to raise our voices. We initially asked kindly attendant Mark for room temperature water for the crying baby, and he went back to inform the other flight attendant of our situation since he was sitting in the back and in charge of that area; however he said when the opportunity came he’d get it. 20 minutes passed so I attempted to go the bathroom to get tap water for my baby, but since the seatbelt sign was on he refused again. Attendant Mark then starts serving paid services (specialty crackers) in our area and still no water for my crying baby insight. At this point I raised my voice as my blood was boiling and hurting for my baby who couldn’t get something as simple as water for our formula. I was even willing to pay or get it myself if no one could help.  We would get water during the drink service, but no baby can wait 40 minutes.",-1

No. Was the plane uncomfortable? No. But what bothers me about this airline is they made no announcements to the passengers on the plane about the unscheduled delay until asked an hour into the delay.

Sign on counter said there hours 8:15am. It was 8:00am At 8:45am still no one working The line was now out the door. I called the number advertised on the counter 65 minute wait. At 9:10am I called the Minneapolis airport to have JetBlue paged. 10min later they all strolled out laughing and joking. I pointed out the time on there sign said 8:15am I was told No we don’t have to go by that as long as we come out 2 hours before a flight we are good. I said the kiosk are not working they all laughed Yes we know. By the time they got the computers on and stopped joking around it was 1hour before I got to security The airlines are surprised that customers are being aggressive on flights. It all starts as soon as we walk up to the ticket booth. You get treated terribly. Then you get to be degraded by the TSA people that could careless. Then you go to the rude people at the gate.,-1
2022-09-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Boston,,,,,,1.0,1,extremely traumatizing experience,True,"  My recent interactions with Jetblue and their representatives was an extremely traumatizing experience. At the airport for my flight from LA to Boston,at Los Angeles LAX JetBlue domestic check-in gate, I was denied boarding because the check-in agent made the unilateral decision that my service animal, Skylar, was not allowed on board, despite repeated attempts to show her the appropriate documentation in my possession as well as explaining our history together. Her questions and attitude towards me and my experience at the check-in were curt and dismissive to me as a person and insensitive to my condition. I imagine her frustrated attitude was due to the fact that there was a lot of confusion and chaos in the boarding area which added to everyone's discomfort. Additionally, her questions were not in line with the code of federal regulations when she demanded repeatedly for a detailed answer of what service animal I had and wanting for me to say something to justify my disability and need for her. When she considered my answers incomplete, she orally aggressively told me to get out of the line, when all I did was calmly explain my situation, and threatened repeatedly to call the police on me if I did not comply to her demands. The agent then escalated the interaction by saying I was ""no longer a JetBlue customer"" and calling her colleague (I asked to speak to her supervisor which she refused for over an hour, and only another employee came 1 whole hour later) with a member of LAPD police despite my reasonable answers in the face of her intimidating tactics. When I realized that the CRO was not there to arbitrate, rather support only the agent and not me as a customer, I had no recourse but to fly a different airline. American Airlines check-in counter was in the same area as the JetBlue check-in. The American Airlines agents accepted me as a customer when I produced my service animal documents without further questioning. When I followed up with Jetblue customer service, their agent inaccurately described the events and offered a) absolutely no compensation for what had happened, when all I asked for simply just the cash refund for the flight they refused to let me on, b) they have me stuck with flight credits that I cannot and refuse to use, c) admitted they did nothing wrong or illegal. When it comes to airline travel, I would like to know that those who are tasked with providing a pleasant experience from gate to gate are reasonable employees with proper training instead of discriminatory judgement, especially against a young woman of color with a disability service dog. Failing that, I would expect a reputable company to make right any failings in that experience. The agents are examples of how Jetblue and its employees are callous, rude, and misuse the power and responsibility they have. Travelers, especially those requiring accommodations, should look to another airline as Jetblue does not have any interest in customer safety or satisfaction.",-1
2022-09-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Syracuse,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,given me the worst experience,False,"  Jetblue by far has given me the worst experience of my life this far. Not only was my flight delayed due to them. Causing me to miss my connect flight back to Syracuse. They put me in a hotel, almost missed the shuttle to the hotel because of how late we landed… once we got to the hotel, I found out we have to find our own transportation back because they don’t have a shuttle running earlier than 6:30am. Our flight left JFK at 6:30am. And that’s not even the worst, once we get to our room at the Hilton gardens Inn there were roaches in on our beds and the bathroom. The bathroom was disgusting with no running water. I checked out immediately as I have 2 small children with me. They were terrified. While I’m the waiting room sitting down trying to figure things out, a roach crawled up my 5 year old daughters leg. I called JETBLUE and was advised by one of their “managers” they couldn’t do anything to help me. After I asked them for another supervisor, she proceeded to hang up on me. The hotel had no transportation and at the time no Uber/Lyft or taxi. I had to take a bus and a train to get back to JFK, all at 1:30am. Once there we had to sit until 7:15 am to get back into another connect flight. A nightmare is an understatement.",-1

2022-09-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Cartagena via New York JFK,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,JetBlue doesn’t care enough about customer service,True, JetBlue canceled the first leg of my flight from San Jose CA to JFK New York. This also caused us to miss our flight from JFK to Cartagena Colombia. We were not given a reason for the cancellation. We received notices of delay before the flight and after we reached the airport we were told the flight was cancelled. We were rebooked on an American Airlines flight the following day at 11.30 pm. We needed to get new COVID tests to enter Colombia at a cost of $150. We had to pay for a night at our hotel in Cartagena that were were not there to use. We had to pay for a car that we had booked to take us from the airport in Cartagena to our hotel that we could not use. After our trip I contacted JetBlue to request that they reimburse us for these costs and after submitting all the paperwork they requested they just said they would not cover these expenses. I realize that there is no law that requires airline to reimburse these costs but had hoped that they would do this as a customer service as the flight was not cancelled as a result of weather or act of god. JetBlue doesn’t care enough about customer service to do this. I will not fly them again and I want other to know how they treat their customers.,-1
2022-08-30,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to New York JFK,4.0,4.0,1.0,,,5.0,2,Seat 16D tray was not cleaned,True,"  Flight 872 on Friday, 8/26/2022. The front lavatory stunk badly. It’s a good thing the back lavatory was in acceptable condition. Seat 16D tray was not cleaned. I requested the lady Inflight Crew to kindly assist. She laid several napkins on top of the pinkish stain and torn napkin stuck on the stain, said “sorry about that”, and something like she will take care of it later. After the drinks and snacks service, she didn’t bother to wipe the tray. I do appreciate her having said sorry and her temporary solution.",1

The flight could not leave at 10:48. He checked why my layover was only 50 minutes. He then informed me that it’s the same plane to New York and the embarkation gate would be the same gate where we would disembark. He also printed my next boarding pass and handed it to me as I was concerned and mentioned to him that the app would generate my connecting flight’s boarding pass only after the first flight would be completed. I thanked him and approached him again to say how relieved I was because of his courteous and pleasant assistance.,1

Our family’s experience to and fro the journey on this airline was nothing other than commendation for the airline, the staff etiquette and attitudes, the foods/drinks galore, free snacks provided at the rear of the plane, inflight entertainment, cleanness and serene ambience of the interior of the plane, is something to write home about. It was a great service, and happy to fly them again and recommend them too. A particular host on board, Paul, was exceptionally polite, and made great efforts at enhancing the inflight experience. I observed that Jetblue air hostesses/hosts are given the opportunity to make important announcements about the flights/arrivals, etc.",1
2022-08-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to London,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,Very disappointed in JetBlue,True,"  We were leaving to London from Salt Lake City Utah. We had a layover in NY. The person at SLC accidentally unchecked us through London. No big deal. Stuff happens! But when we went to gate 23 on flight 007 to London leaving at 6:00 p.m on August 26th we were greeted by Troy and his assistant who was not wearing a name badge so we could not get her name. We told them are situation where the Salt Lake City employee accidentally unbooked are seat assignments to London. So we went to see if they could upgrade us to mint since those were the only seats together. They said no which is no big deal but worth a shot. So we asked if we could at least be put together since it was a 7 hour flight. They said no and persisted to basically call my wife a liar about having seats together and accused us of never having assigned seats. So my wife patiently waited for them to stop firmly speaking to my wife as if she was stupid. Then my wife presented the boarding passes that we printed in Salt Lake City Utah proving that all are seats together. They seemed dumbfounded and still stuck with there overbearing attitudes. How these to people are in the customer service industry is beyond me. The Horrible thing about this, is that all of the experiences with JetBlue members were very pleasing. Both of these people were horrible to my wife and tried to make her feel less than. Very disappointed in JetBlue!",-1

Our 1st leg of the flight was delayed for 1 hour, so we were not able to make it to the 2nd leg of the flight. I am pregnant with certain food restrictions (there is no food I can buy in the airport), after I explained this to the agent, the agent said that I should expect some extra expenses on this trip, as there were no available flight until next day. No options except waiting in the airport for the next 22 hours without food ! So ridiculous! I bought Southwest tickets to get home at the same day right away . Will never fly Jet Blue again.",-1
2022-08-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Punta Cana,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly with JetBlue ever again,True,"  Flight from Newark, NJ to Punta Cana, DR on August 6- Be aware of the charges on excess weight on a checked baggage. The day before departure my husband and I paid $35 for each bag, total of $70. The day of departure when the bags were weight in at the checked baggage counter, the weight of one bag was 4lbs over and the second bag was 6lbs for a total of 10lbs. The Jet Blue person behind the counter stated that I needed to take our some clothing from the two bags. I asked her if she had a bag to give me and she stated that she did not. I didn't carry another bag or carry on because our tickets were blue basic which we are not allow to have a carry on. The JetBlue person at the counter said that she had to charge us $150 for each bag in excess for which I told her that was a ridiculous charge for a bag that was not over 10lbs. I told her that most JetBlue should charge is $35 to 50, just as if I had a third bag. Unfortunately, we paid the $300 because I was so embarrassed at the airport with over 300 travelers waiting to check in their bags and so upset. I reached out to JetBlue last Sunday and no answer. JetBlue contacted me today, unfortunately they are not going to refund my $300 per the customer support person that email me today. I will never fly with JetBlue ever again. The disrespect on any travelers is unheard of. This is for travelers to know, read everything from what you purchase on any airline, especially JetBlue. JetBlue had no consideration trying to make the consumer happy, or as even to make things right by either giving us the whole refund or even half, they just take advantage of the travelers. I also paid for seats on the plane that were suppose to be extra leg room which I didn't mention because my husband said that Jet Blue would not give a worry to much about it. According to a pilot that was on our flight that was sitting near my husband, there is no extra leg room on JetBlue planes. So why are they charging the travelers? Do your homework on getting the best of your vacation. I got to Punta Cana that day with such a headache, that it lasted me until the next day.",-1

Arriving in Charleston I made a claim. According to what they told me, they located the luggage in Newark and they would send it to me in Charleston. I finished my vacation in Charleston and never came. I was authorized to make purchases and so I did, buying the minimum with my BPPR Jet Blue credit card. Since then I have submitted all the documents and reports that have been required of me, I have called by phone, I have gone to the Charleston and PR airports and still no one has been able to help me. On occasions I have made the call but then they leave me waiting. I understand that this situation has not been handled properly for my benefit as your client. I will appreciate someone answer.

My flight from St. Lucia to JFK was delayed for over 8 hours and they didn’t even offer a simple apology. When I called to make a claim and they had me hold for over and hour, then said I will be getting an email in 21 days after they completed their investigations. Mind you, I called twice. Its rather unfortunate that I have to continue using JetBlue because they are the only direct flight to St. Lucia.",-1

Our flight was delayed for 2,5 hours, and when we came to our gate it was announced that crew members’ work time was ended so we’d fly from Santo Domingo to Fort Lauderdale to change the crew and then go to New York with the new crew. Then we were boarded. And after 20 minutes of sitting at the plane it was announced “The take off is delayed again so we’re not gonna fly till the morning, we’ll take you back to the airport tans give you back your baggage”. So they booked a hotel for us and checked in for the morning flight (8 o’clock). Next morning we came to the airport at 5:40 and we had to check in our bags again ( we stayed in line for more than hour). And when we were about to board they told us that the gate was changed and the flight was delayed for two hours. And we’re still waiting for our flight at the worst airport I’ve ever seen",-1

To begin with the customer service was horrible. They did not greet you and were not welcoming , they looked like they didn’t want to be there and seemed annoyed when you called them. I used to always fly JetBlue but honestly this will be the last time. I also was turned off that I was charged for headphones and food, when on American Airlines it was for free and better quality. I am so disappointed with the service and quality of the flight.",-1

They Charge you extra for your carry on bags and do not let you carry the bags on board. You have to check them in. I not only had to pay for my bags but I was unable to bring my bags on board and most, if not all all, overhead bins were empty the entire flight. In addition, upon my arrival to my destination, I had to wait at the carousel for one hour to get my checked bags. They also charge you for the “free” inflight movies by charging you $6 for the earbuds to watch those “free” inflight movies. They claim to have “free wifi” but you cannot connect to their WiFi. I will no longer give my business to JetBlue.",-1

JetBlue cancelled the flight at 4 am and when I arrived with my ticket on my apple wallet at 6 am, TSA recheck official directed me back to JetBlue kiosk where I was told I had not checked in to the new flight they had just create 2 hrs prior. Looked at my email and there it was! a 4 am notification of a flight cancellation with a rebooking for a flight with the exact same departure time .. obviously this is a scheme to get last minute cancellations on early flights and they managed to book my seat for someone else. Fighting to get some flight credit back but honestly will probably avoid flying with them",-1

The day I am able to check in I receive an email telling me I am not entitled to a carry one bag because I’m flying economy and must check my bag and pay $35 to do so. This is disgusting behavior designed to extract even more money from customers who have no choice but to pay this charge. There is no one that flies without any bags so actually the fare is $35 higher than the listed price. Typical corporate theft from the public and we are all forced to pay it because there are no laws preventing this and all the airlines do the same thing because they can get away with it. Oh and the flight was an hour late. Maybe I should charge Jet Blue $35 for lateness.",-1

Will not refund my fee for the checked bag I paid for knowing I was too late to check a bag. Never flying JetBlue again. Customer Service defers to their ""Terms and Conditions"" ... you would think the reps at the desk would let me know it was too late to pay for a checked bag before paying and direct me to customer service for a refund? Refund has to be made prior to the flight taking off, even though they rebooked us on a flight we had to be escorted through security and RUN to our gate to make the new flight. So ridiculous.  Will never utilize them again.",-1

They could not get us on the next flight to San Juan so we where stuck in Boston only to take the next flight to Orlando the next day. They still could not get us on a flight to from Orlando to San Juan so we have to stay in Orlando for a night. Once we got to Orlando they lost our bags.

Upon arriving at the airport, I received a text message stating that the flight was canceled which I ignored because my mom was hospitalized and I needed to see her. When I reached the counter, they informed me that my flight was in fact canceled, and the earliest possible flight available, will be April 4. Feeling so dejected, but determined to see my mom alive regardless, I had to pay $867 with another airline even though I would be getting there later than expected. I arrived at my final destination and learned that my mom passed few hours before I got there. I’ve lost not only the money I spent to pay the fare, but also $80 to pre check luggage.

2022-07-28,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LaGuardia to Kingston via Ft Lauderdale,4.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,try and do better for your customers,True,"  One of the worst traveling day I ever experienced. My daughter, my mother-in -law and Myself have experience. We have over the fact that we have been to the airport from 3am to catch 6am flight and our flight turn in an 8pm rather flight. Which end up from our original airport which is LaGuardia and have to pay for another Uber to get JFK to catch flight that scheduled for 1pm, only to get emails on top of e-mails that the flight delayed over and over. When we were finally on board at 2pm we sat on the plane without any explanation of why we are not able to at least move a bit. We were taking off the plane without another explanation as to why. We had been held back on the plane again for another two hour without still an explanation again why we weren’t moving. We were talking down to, talking about, like we don’t matter. One of the flight attendants was rude, disrespectful and have no regards to our feelings. Finally, we take off which is now after 8pm only to get to Kingston Jamaica after 11pm where our luggage was nowhere to be found. That took us another 2 hours to take care, of which ends in a no luggage to go home with and reach home at 2am. I had been calling as to where my luggage is, I got yelled at, saying it seem like I was getting frustrated and was hang up on. Remember now am in Jamaica, phone calls to USA are expensive and had been on hold for ever, only to come get hang up on, so not only do I have waste time hold on the phone for almost an hour I was treated like I don’t matter and hang up on which just end up cost me money for the calls. Finally, after three days and three nights in Jamaica without clothes and personal items for my family and I. We finally got our luggage after 9pm only to see how broken up our suitcases are, they can’t stand on their own and cannot reuse. So, to sums this all up it was a stressful situation and to tell you the truth I was expecting hostility from the people on board but we have some wonderful people on board that behave very well.  JetBlue need to do better not because you can send out an apology that don’t make it better you guys have to figure out ways to work this out so we can have a better communication with your customers. We deserve to treat more than this, we have feelings. Fix the problem because apologies can not only do because people time, money, effort mean a lot to them. Please try and do better for your customers.",-1

Then comes another hour+ of customer service being able to get non locals hotels and that’s pretty much all they can do. Can’t even cancel the flight and give a refund.

2022-07-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Cleveland,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3,he won't help us without us paying,False,"  We were flying from Boston to Cleveland and due to an error needed to change our flight to an earlier flight that had at least 25 seats available. After calling in advance to make the shift we were told that the change can only be made after modify the day of the flight. On the day of the flight we called and they said that now we will incur a $75 same day fee which was not mentioned to us earlier. We were told to go to the airport to talk to the ticket counter since they may be able to help us more. We arrived to the airport early and talked to a manager, explained the situation and then asked if he can help, knowing that he had authority to wave the fee and make the shift. He bluntly said he won't help us without us paying and that he doesn't care if we remain customers or not. We were calm and respectful and he was very dismissive and rude. We decided to take the later flight only to learn that that flight had a long list of standby passengers. By shifting our seats he would have helped alleviate that problem on the later flight. We fly all over the world and have developed a loyalty to particular airlines and decided to try Jet Blue. It's unfortunate that the manager was so short sighted to see that with a little bit of respectful conversation and trying to help he would not only help multiple customers but also gain support for the airline through word of mouth and we would have elected to use their services again. Now we will let people know not to use them if they can help it.",-1
2022-07-10,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft. Lauderdale,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,3,not been the best experience,True,  I fail to understand why we set rules & why we pay to have extra comforts. Why do we sell more leg room to some if I could just book a flight have no assigned seat and get seated in more space for no extra fee. A family of four sat right next yo me on this flight - I know their tickets were not purchased with the extra as they boarded in group C. Also it’s an exit row which I propose LY always choose due to the age restriction. The son in this family of four could be no more than 14. It’s disappointing as I normally have no issues with this airline but the last 2 flight have not been the best experience.,1
2022-07-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Austin,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,unprofessionalism was disgusting to witness,True,"  This is the worst air line I have ever witnessed in my life. It was my first time flying ever, my flight was at 8:40. Then without even giving us enough heads up it was changed to 10:45. Then they switched us over to a new gate to wait. Then they switched us to a third new gate and told us boarding changed to 11:35. It is now 12:17 and we have yet to board and it got switched to 12:30 without them letting us know on the loud speakers. I will never in my life fly with Jet Blue again; the unprofessionalism was disgusting to witness",-1
2022-07-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Denver,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never fly JetBlue again,False,"  I originally purchased my tickets based on the fact that the airline had two seats on one side and three on the other. I purposefully purchased tickets in the back at row 21 so we could sit alone. Which meant we boarded last. I could have purchased seats in row 12 and sat next to another person, but we wanted to sit alone. Our original flight was changed and delayed several hours. When we finally boarded at 10:30 pm, the airplane changed and we sat in a three person row. If I would have known we were going to sit next to another person, I would have purchased the seats in row 12, not 21. So now, we have no bag space, a person sitting next to us, and arriving home at 2 am. Needless to say, I will never fly JetBlue again and will tell everyone I know, to avoid them unless you want the lowest end flight experience. Okay, to be fair, there is a very blurry tv screen in front of me, which perhaps, Frontier and Spirit don’t have.",-1
2022-07-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,unable to think for themselves,True," Denver to Boston. This is the absolute worst airline I’ve ever dealt with. They canceled my flight because their pilots were at there time limit for flying. So I had to buy a ticket that was triple the price to get where I needed to go. Of course the multi million dollar company can’t reimburse me my 850$ plane ticket because that’s too much of a burden for them. I was then told they would reimburse me 250$ for a hotel room. This sounds nice but unfortunately when you end up paying an unexpected fee of 850 additional dollars, some people can’t afford a hotel room. After talking with countless employees who quite literally sounded like they were all reading a script, unable to think for themselves. They all gave me the same conclusion that there is nothing they can do and as a bonus no one I spoke to seemed to have a person above them to handle this, so convenient isn’t it?",-1
2022-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I would have given a zero rating,True,"  We are True Blue members. Vacationed in SLO CA about 3 hrs from LAX. JetBlue cancelled our return flight out of LAX expecting us to take an LAX flight at 6am, which would have required my family of 5 to leave at 1am to get to the airport 2 hrs early. We rebooked out of SFO to make it home. By doing so, we had to drop off our Budget car rental at a SFO instead of LAX. We prepaid $827 for wk car rental in CA. Budget hit me with another $425 due to change in return location caused by Jetblue. Airline companies like Jetblue could care less. They are economically killing the consumer with all of these cancellations and effecting our hotels, car rental, ABNB, work reservations and schedules. Jetblue should be accountable when they cause these disruptions and added expenses to the consumer. I would have given a zero rating if it would allow for such.",-1
2022-07-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Mayaguez,,,,,,,1,upset with the way things were handled,False,"  Originally bought tickets for my father to pick up his mother in Puerto Rico (which is why I can’t verify the review, the boarding passes are all under everyone else’s names) and bring her back for care here in the mainland US. She contracted sickness suddenly and I had to make quite a few changes to the itineraries such as adding my mother to go with my father as he needs assistance with his own health issues and he would probably now need to stay more than a week. Even with knowing my grandmother might be passing, they refused to give me any kind of discount. Then my grandmother did pass, and I needed to make more changes to my parents return tickets. More refusals for discounts and the attention very nonchalant. I get it, you’re tired and you want to go home and I must have been the thousand customer of the day with a stressful situation. Get in line right? I’m upset with the way things were handled and instead of spending my original $600 something, with all these changes with my grandmothers passing, I ended up spending over 1,400 dollars. JetBlue does not care about your situation, they are more concerned with squeezing you for every last penny regardless. I will not forget the way JetBlue helped me during this difficult time in my life. My parents are retired and I’m unmarried so no dual income. I will have to eat this cost entirely. Not to mention all the costs I’m eating in addition…I was expecting my grandmother to be coming back with my father so I bought her a thousand dollar sofa bed (taxes and fees) and little things here and there. That part has nothing to do with JetBlue but I’m emotionally and monetarily exhausted and spent and I feel they could have given me SOMETHING of a discount.",-1
2022-06-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Port of Spain,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I want my money back,True," Fort Lauderdale to Port of Spain. I booked a flight to Trinidad 3 years ago and because of Covid had to cancel as they were not allowing flights in the country, I called Jetblue and they said I can either get a refund or they can put it in a travel bank which I can use at a later date, she said once Trinidad opens back up I can use that money for another ticket. Three years later my travel bank money is about to expire so I book tickets to NY for me and my friend, her ticket was $308 dollars. About a week later Trinidad borders opened back up so I spoke with a gentleman with JetBlue who was very nice and was able to use the ticket as well as my money from my ticket and book us the flight to Trinidad, all was well. Then this morning JetBlue emails me saying they cancelled my flight to Trinidad which is absolutely ridiculous. Apparently they are no longer flying to that country as of today. I called JetBlue after waiting 2 hours to get a person on the phone, the woman refused to refund me even though they cancelled, she said all they can do is put it back in the travel bank. That serves me no purpose as the only place I travel to is Trinidad because that is where my entire family lives, including my very elderly sick parents. I need my money back so that I can go book with another airline. They owe me $683 and I want my money back. I also asked to speak to a manager and she refused to help as well.",-1
2022-06-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Montego Bay via New York,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1,attempted to charge us for the bags again,True,"  My new wife and I had a lovely vacation. We spent 9 days in Jamaica and one in New York. The entire trip was excellent, except our time with JetBlue. To begin, we got notified that our flight got changed a week before the vacation and it made our 6 hour layover 15 hours. This was a major inconvenience as we were scrambling to find a hotel in New York. Luckily, we were able to find one. On top of this, we were also told we would have to pay for our checked bags again. Luckily, after speaking with many customer service agents one told us otherwise. However, when we got to the JFK airport they attempted to charge us for the bags again and questioned why I would have been told they would waive the bag fees. Luckily they did waive the fees for the connecting flight. As we started our trip our first flight they left our bags in New York as we ventured on to Jamaica. We were without our luggage fore the first 36 hours. Luckily, they offered to reimburse us for the clothing we needed during this 36 hours. However, this put a major strain on my wife’s anxiety. After our trip, we began to venture to New York for our 15-hour layover. During this flight, the flight attendants were extremely rude. It was very uncomfortable. To add on, our 4th flight with them, the boarding was delayed 30 minute. This was no problem for us, however when they offered no information and finally came on the intercom to let us know we would be “boarding soon” 10 minutes before we did and 15-20 minutes after scheduled boarding. Also, upon arrival to Detroit we had to sit for 20 minutes on the plane waiting for a gate. Lastly, JetBlue’s check in system and customer support is a joke. My wife and I as well as many other guests trying to check in were not able to do so and had to wait in line for up to an hour. As for customer service, good luck. If you need to contact JetBlue I hope your able to sit on hold for 90+ minutes or wait for them to respond via chat for 2+ hours. They don’t offer anything for inconveniences. No refunds or bag vouchers.",-1

They sell you a flight, secure your payment and then change your flight and offer you a Jetblue credit for a future flight. Truly Horrible. You can try to complain or even just request some assistance but their website is designed to frustrate you and retard any real progress. I avoid flying as much as possible because of how the airlines rip us off and screw us around. I also can't believe our so called rulers have sold us all out and just let these horrible corporations to do whatever they want to customers without any accountability.",-1

Four of us (me, wife, 7 yr and 1.5 yr old) went through 2.5 hour long security check in. Flight was at 9.59pm. Got delayed to 11.22pm. at 10.30pm send message that flight got cancelled. No information at the gate. Staff at gate said well flight got cancelled and we don't know anything else. Check your emails for more details. Went to help desk for rebooking and night stay. They even won't allow us to ask any crew for this and said check your email we can't help you. Went to baggage claim as we had six bags checked in. They lost one and blamed me that you have only checked 5. After one hour discussion they said they found that sixth was checked in. Although they were not able to find sixth one and said they will let me know. Nothing on compensation side for overnight stay as flight was obviously cancelled due to lack of passengers though they just said it is ATC issue. Spent 3 to 4 hours to get my bags and left airport at 2 am. Only compensation they gave was $50 credit to book next Jet Blue flight per traveler. Hotel and taxi cost me $500 and this guys just even there to talk. This airline has poor management. 2 hrs wait to talk with them when you are at the airport and trying to figure out things at 1 am.

2022-06-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Salt Lake City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The absolute worst experience,True,"  The absolute worst experience I have ever had. I will never fly on JetBlue again. The level of incompetence at every single step was absolutely shocking. Arrived to JFK to find out our flight was cancelled. Was told to walk half a mile with all of our luggage to the rebooking line. Stood in line for nearly 2 hours only to be told that there was nothing they could do. Our 4 hour direct flight to SLC had been automatically rebooked to a flight The next day with a connection from Boston that took over 12 hours. Basically losing and entire day and a half of my life. Walked the half mile back up to the “kiosk help desk” where we waited in line for another hour. The girl at the kiosk clearly had no idea what she was doing. After standing there watching her struggle for over 15 minutes to try to find any other flight options, I had to grab another employee to help her. By this point there was nothing they could do because any chance we had of getting on an earlier flight was lost because we stupidly waited in multiple lines for over 4 hours due to the incorrect instructions of everyone who tried to “help” us. Not only were the employees not helpful, they were also rude and impatient. There was also no compensation for hotels, or transportation for the extra day lost. I have never been so angry in my entire life. This airline is negligent!!",-1
2022-06-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly JetBlue ever again,True,"  I will never fly JetBlue ever again. This was the worst experience with an airline I've ever had. I was supposed to leave Boston at 4:00 today, but due to D.C weather that never happened , which I could forgive under normal circumstances, however what happened was they had us board the plane to then have us unboard it for ""50 minutes"" which quickly turned into six plus hours. I couldn't eat, because it was always just one more hour. Eventually at 11:30 they told us they were finally boarding. They proceeded 7 minutes later to inform us that they were canceling the flight and we needed to go to the ticket desk. At the desk I was told that there were no flights for the next day and that I should keep my eyes open for a potential email for a voucher. This overall is an awful experience and I can't really capture in words how angry and disrespected I feel right now at 12:56am in the morning. Now I need to pay money for a whole other day here including a hotel room. I'm lucky that my parents have a hotel in town here where I can sleep on the bathroom floor. Yeah thanks JetBlue.",-1

The flight was scheduled to leave Burbank airport at 1.45pm, but did not leave until 5.30pm. The flight crew was communicating that issue was they were not able to fill the airplane with fuel to get us to New York due to the airplane engine issue and therefore they had to figure out a different route where they can stop by to fill the airplane. The time to fuel the plane was also expected to be 30 minutes however it did not leave the airport for another hour and a half to two hours. During this time, there were multiple passengers that have flown with JetBlue in the past and were receiving emails letting them know that their account will be credited for the delay. Since this is my first time flying with JetBlue, I did not have an account and therefore did not receive an email however I called JetBlue to let them know about the delay and ask for compensation. The person I spoke to on the phone informed me that the issue was whether and therefore out of JetBlue’s control so they cannot issue credit or any sort of compensation. I was very shocked and disappointed by the fact that the airline did not document the actual reason why there was a delay on this flight to avoid any compensation or credit to their passengers. It was the worst experience I’ve ever had and will never ever use this airline again!",-1

They will end up looking for any vacant space at the back. And also not to bring anything that has the size larger than a regular bag as it won't fit under the seat. We happened to sit on row 1 and the flight stewardess was not helpful to help us find a space to place our back pack (imagine, just a backpack) as it won't fit under the seat. She was not helpful. She was just standing in the corner telling us what to do (with a sour face) instead of helping us look for a space as what I had normally experienced from other flight attendants. We would rather have our backpack placed under the seat as we didn't want to disturb other passengers on the plane but she insisted that we should place it inside the overhead bin.",-1
2022-06-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,The worst customer service,False,"  The worst customer service I've ever experienced for a U.S. flight. I traveled with a guitar and brought it onto the plane as the carryon bag. I've traveled with guitars many times before and there had never been an issue. When I boarded, the overhead cabins around my seats were full, so I came up to the flight assistant, asking if she can help me to arrange a space. She looked at me with arrogance and didn't even budge, only said ""I cannot help you, you'll gonna have to check it. Would you like to do that right now?"" I was shocked at her attitude and didn't know what to do at that moment. She then asked me to go back to my seat because the plane was about to depart. Nobody on the plane offered help the whole time either. Eventually I was lucky enough to find one overhead cabin that fit my guitar myself. But that was definitely the worst flight assistant I've ever encountered and I will never fly with JetBlue ever again.",-1

Lauderdale, a 10pm flight on Friday, it’s Saturday afternoon and we have been delayed almost 18 hours, the reason? Because of 1 single crew member. They can not fly the plane without a full crew, and JetBlue was unable to find one nor fly one to the city in almost a whole day. And when one arrived, they ""needed to rest"" and along the way, every single member of the JetBlue employees lied to us and withheld info, to the point that on Friday they told us ""good news, your flight isn’t cancelled but it will be delayed until tomorrow"". In other words it was ""good news"" for JetBlue because not cancelling means we the passengers could not get refunds! We had to stay here in the airport like cattle while they slept in beds, needless to say, all of us are livid and the lies keep coming. The latest was that the crew is in Vegas and coming, we heard that for the past 2 hours. Where in Vegas are they that they require over 2 hours to get to the airport? Liars. They don’t have the guts to tell us the truth. My hope for JetBlue is bankruptcy. I did hear, however, that the pilot who was talking to another pilot, that it wasn’t his flight but that JetBlue is ""paying me big time for this, so yeah I’m here"", so glad JetBlue dished out for a pilot and not for its customers.

They refused to give us refunds, so everyone had to find a hotel for the night so we could take the next flight in the morning. They also refused to cover our hotel bill as well. They wasted the time of our day in the airport, don’t cover our hotel for their mistakes, wait a couple of hours to unload bags so we can pick them up, it was extremely unorganized and unprofessional and absolutely a mess.

Talking with the customer service agent was the most frustrating experience as she could not really give me any options but she was the ""supervisor."" Unwilling to give me a refund in my method of payment but said I had to get a credit for the flight since they were willing to give me a ""even exchange"" to the city over 2 hours away.

Missed our connecting flights. Sat on tarmac for over an hour after boarding. 1 hour 55 minute flight was changed to a 2 hour 45 min flight due to a route change.

When I explained that he couldn’t be by himself and could they figure out another alternative, they explained that another “larger” family had booked and there was no way to sit us together! First of all, how is that my problem as I paid the same amount for my ticket as they did! Secondly, their next solution was for me to pay more to sit together! I will never fly with this company again as they are so budget that they sit a 9 year old by themselves and think that is ok! I’ve heard many bad things about this company and this will be my first and last flight with them!",-1

I missed a flight because jetblue updated my flight with 2 hours delay at around 4 pm. Original flight was 7:20 pm but changed to 9:11 pm departure. I checked my app all the time for updates and it was still confirmed that delay of 2 hrs. So i adjusted my driving to the airport. Right about 6:50 it wax still delayed, but @ 7:10 when i wac about to keave my house, they change back to boarding time beginning now. While I am still at home relaying on the information they provided before. How horrible it is. I tried to call in vain waiting for 1 hr - no answer.

We actually boarded close to midnight because of lightning, then a replacement part, then a plane out of service and then a sick crew member. We were then on the runaway for over an hour to be told we were returning to the gate to refuel because the plane was being rerouted to a longer route. It is now 1:30 am and we’re sitting here getting fuel. My question is, how is JetBlue planning on making this up to its customers. This is just disgraceful!",-1
2022-06-01,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Boston,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,so undertrained in their field,False,"  I’ve always loved flying JetBlue because of their great service and accommodation. But my flights out of Albuquerque this week were unmatched in making me wanna scream at other humans. Our flight leaving Albuquerque was delayed an hour and a half which caused us miss our connection to Boston. This was unavoidable, but the reasoning we actually got was that a flight attendant at one of the airports was late to their shift causing delays for entire day. Insane. So we talked with JetBlue Albuquerque staff to try and figure out a new connection. When we were told the only flight available to us would be one 13 hours later we were astounded.  I opened hopper and looked for other flights. Immediately, I found an American Airlines flight. One at 8:05am and one at 9:50am. We would arrive at 7:30am in JFK and were told we would “definitely” have enough time to make the 8:05am. Egg on my face for not remembering what JFK is like. But when my party and an additional group of 9 got to the shuttle exit for the American flight to BOS, we were all denied at once with no consideration of holding the flight. We had been told the same information and advise. No effort was made to accommodate our situation. So we were directed to the JetBlue help desk. This is where things got unbelievable. Me and my partner approached the help desk and were met with rude and intensely unhelpful agent who really only wanted to tell us things to make us go away. The only option we were given was a flight at 10:30pm; It was 8:00am. This was, of course, totally unacceptable. I understand JetBlue is super understaffed, but the people we talked to throughout our entire trip were so undertrained in their field it was laughable. As a customer service representative, I don’t think you should start a conversation with yelling, well that’s what happened to us. The reasoning for this was explained in an unclear and facetious way. We were yelled at by the attendant and told there was nothing they could do at all to accommodate us or help. We were booked on a 10:30pm flight and given standby tickets on a 9:50am flight, (no guarantee). We walked away, resigned to our situation, but then realized we didn’t know where our checked bags would be. We came back to the help desk and dealt with a different attendant who reexplained the situation calmly and politely (wow that must’ve been so hard for that other lady to do). People who were in our same connection situation all were trying to do the same, all met with intense rudeness. So me and my partner arrived at our new possible flight Gate 30 flight 690 with service to BOS at 9:50am. This had a boarding time of 9:32am. I watched as this flight attendant caused serious delays of up to 40 minutes because she had an issue with every other customer. This is not an exaggeration. Finally, after everyone was boarded, all us standby customers were left. An older man, who did not speak English very well, approached asking for help. His pleas were met with dismissive responses and no effort to make sure he understood the situation. I understood he never got an actual standby ticket from the help desk, but because of the language barrier, he couldn’t understand what was going on. No effort was made to get a translator for this man and he was left in JFK. We finally got on the flight by minutes.",-1

I was tired and exhausted and unable to argue and explaining to her it was a carry on, specially after 2 hours flight delay. On top of that they gave seat apart when I asked them to put us together she said we need to pay for upgrade.",-1
2022-05-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,This severe neglect of a minor is inexcusable,True," Yesterday, JetBlue cancelled a connecting flight for our niece, who is only 17 (and considered a minor by the United States government) and was traveling alone. We were only given 2 hours notice, which was not enough time to find flights on other airlines. They refused to put her on a different airline and only offered her a flight for Monday, which would have been 48 hours later. That meant they were perfectly comfortable forcing a 17 year old girl to be stranded at an airport in a state where she knew no one for 48 hours. They did not care if she slept or ate, or that she was scared and alone, and did not consider what could happen to her during that time. We texted with three different customer service representatives, the customer service representative who was at the JetBlue desk in JFK, all of which were rude and offered no solutions other than the Monday flight. Her parents ended up having to book her a different flight on American Airlines to get her back home. This severe neglect of a minor is inexcusable. I want other people to know about the treatment of children between the ages of 14-17 so that they do not book JetBlue flights for their children and do not have to go through what our family went through.",-1
2022-05-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,There was no care or concern for us at all,False,"  Do yourself a favor and listen to all of the bad reviews you see for this airline – especially from recently. Every review from the past few months outlines the exact same issue we had with Jetblue this week. We've had a horrible experience and so have many others, so heed the warnings now before you choose this airline. Girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Fort Lauderdale from Newark, NJ. First red flag was our departing flight that they pushed from 10am to 6am about two weeks before the trip. Inconvenient, but not a huge deal. We accommodated it fine. Wish we would've had a little more of a heads-up, but things happen. The problem really came on our returning flight. Reported some bad weather back in the Newark area, with Jetblue sending us an email that the flight was still active and it was unlikely that it would be moved or canceled. Flight was supposed to leave at 8pm. No worries, we kept our eye on it. Checkout for our room was at 11am. 10 minutes before room service came knocking on our door to kick us out of the room, I check our flight status and find it canceled. Not only was it canceled, but there were no other flights for the day for the entire area, not for Newark, and the next nearest airport they had was over two hours away from home. Bad timing, but again, things happen. Really would've wished for more of a heads-up, considering the weather had been predicting storms the day of our return for the whole week. Called the airline for support, trying to desperately move our flight that we waived – they hadn't updated our flight in over an hour after the cancellation. Wait time for the call itself was over 2 hours, which is already ridiculous given the time crunch we were in to find another way home. Panicked and trying to fix the situation, we were met with decent service over the phone with the guy moving our flight to the next day (as it was the only one for Newark and for our area). The problem really came when we went to make a last-minute booking at our hotel following the inconvenience of the cancellation. When we called the airline again to ask for any possible reimbursement or compensation for our hotel room that we had no choice but to book another night for, we were met with an attitude and a completely unaccommodating employee that begrudgingly told us that there wasn't anything they could do, and they were not legally required to compensate for any overnight stays following cancellations. Guess we should've figured they didn't care quite at all, considering the disclaimer on their website already warns you that you're screwed on your own if they call off a flight and leave you stranded like they left us. How did it end? With us having to pay 500 dollars on a Friday night, Memorial Day weekend, at a 3-star hotel in the Ft. Lauderdale area, completely out of luck with absolutely no help or care at all from Jetblue after their last minute cancellation. I'm not one to write negative reviews for anything, but these inconveniences were absolutely unacceptable and quite costly for me and my girlfriend. There was no care or concern for us at all regarding the inconveniences we were put under by this airline, and it seems to me that we're definitely not the only ones with this horrible experience. Do yourself a favor and book with an airline that will warn you ahead of time, work with you in times of inconvenience, and show they give a crap about you when these things occur. Never flying with Jetblue again.",-1

In the last year and a half I’ve come to be somewhat dissatisfied with JetBlue especially Customer service The waits to speak or even to chat with someone are several hours long. They were once a very flexible airline trying to accommodate the passengers needs, today I was with a live agent on chat after waiting for 2.5 hours he rushed me through gave me a link and told me thank you for contacting us I hope I was able to assist you. The only thing he did was informed me that my attempt to change your flight would result in a penalty of $200. When I asked questions he sent me a link to manage my flight. In a moment he was gone. I’ve received another message if you would like to chat again there was a two hour wait would you like to wait. If I’m paying hundreds of dollars for a flight offer anything for that matter I like to feel valued a little bit. JetBlue you disappoint me.",-1

Paid for the seats then another 35 USD for my case, got to check in, oops your case is over that will be another 150 USD, it's nothing but a complete rip off. Flew from Boston to Miami with AA and only additional cost was 30 USD for my case. Needless to say I will never fly Jetblue again and would recommend they are avoided at all costs.",-1
2022-05-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando Fl to Albany NY via Saratoga Springs,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst flight experience imaginable,True,"  Worst flight experience imaginable, they canceled our flight while we were in the terminal with 2 small kids and offered no flights or resolution except a flight 2 days later that would arrive in Buffalo 4 hrs from Albany Airport. Customer service was terrible! Sympathizers waiting in line were more helpful offering us their tickets to Boston and White Plains cause they felt so bad for us, we couldn't accept. JetBlue offered us a rental car reimbursement to drive 20 hrs home which we had no choice at that point but to do that that (it was awful) however we made it on our own safe and sound. Now Jetblue won't reimburse us for the rental car and gas that they promised us! They don't care at all what they put us through. Terrible, worst and most disrespectful company I've ever tried to give business to. It's been 2 weeks and we're still upset about it, as well as out the money for the rental car they promised. Never again will we fly this deceitful airline.",-1

If you have a connection flight definitely missed your connection flight and they will not take any responsibility. My experience because of their mistakes my flight delayed and missed my connection flight. I has to wait more than 8 hrs in the airport with my small kids in the airport. The JetBlue supervisor in Boston airport was very rude and irresponsible. She doesn’t know how to behave the customer’s. My humble request to the travelers, if possible please avoid to travel in JetBlue.",-1
2022-05-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Jose,,,,,,,1,complete disregard for their customers,False,"  I live in the Boston area. I’m going on a vacation to Costa Rica at the end of June. Today, I discovered that Jet Blue changed my flight home. My original flight would have me arriving at Boston at 11:58 PM on July 3. Jet Blue has now scheduled me on an overnight flight with connection in NY, which gets me home at 8:30 AM on July 4. I started on the Jet Blue website. When I enter my Confirmation code and name, I get a red message that says “There was an error processing your request. Please try again. If you receive this error repeatedly, please contact 1-800-JETBLUE for assistance.” After trying multiple times, I called the 800 number, 90 minute wait. I tried the Jet Blue chat. Entered my info and the site said they would contact me. 20 minutes later, I received a chat from Jet Blue’s customer service. I stated that I did not want to fly overnight and asked if they could change my flight back to the earlier flight. The rep said my original flight was cancelled and there was nothing they could do. The rep stated that JetBlue obtained another flight for me rather than stranding me. I asked if there was any rebate due to the fact that I now had to fly overnight. The rep stated that JetBlue would not offer any refunds and that they found me a flight. The rep stated that JetBlue accommodated me on another flight. I stated that it wasn’t an accommodation, it was a huge inconvenience. The rep stated, and I quote “It’s a side effect that comes with the luxury of flying.” There was a time when I held JetBlue in high regard. With this type of customer service, they show a complete disregard for their customers. This isn’t something that can be blamed on the pandemic, this is just being rude.",-1

Was unable to log on to my JetBlue account after 20 tries. Their check-in kiosks at JFK similarly did not work. The line to see an agent had over 100 people in line. The befuddled staff told me that their systems also do not work well. Despite arriving over an hour early, I almost missed my flight. I was saved by there being no one to clean the cabin, which caused about an hour delay. I would prefer a $172 flight with systems that worked to my $72 flight with systems that did network. Worse yet, think about the level of aircraft maintenance that is run by the same company that can not get their check-in process to work. When I called the 800 phone number, their recording says there is a 96-minute wait. DO NOT FLY Jetblue.",-1

We are getting late, very late to DR, but I couldn't afford to lose days, since we are in a 2 week vacation. JetBlue was very unprofessional, not caring, sloppy, disorganized.

Once we got there we were told our flight was canceled, but we had to get back to NYC that Friday. They offered no accommodation, no credit or hotel room, and pretty much kicked us out on the street even though there were little kids with us. At first they wanted to give us a ticket to fly out on Wednesday, we got lucky and are now able to fly out on Sunday instead. It is terrible how they treat their clients what if someone does not have the money to stay in a hotel for another couple days or if someone has to be back home on a specific day for work or school or any other reason.

This company is no longer the best value for money. I have flown with JetBlue for years and every single time there's either a delay, a departure gate change, cancellation, or last-minute itinerary changes. I'm convinced that this airline can never provide a smooth travel experience to anyone. It is THE worst. And most of the time their staffs are unable to manage frustrated customers because they have no de-escalation skills. This is airline needs to do something quick regarding their service quality or they'll be forever stuck in making it up to displeased customers. Today JetBlue strikes again by delaying my departure flight to JFK out of Miami, which translates to me getting stuck in NY the same exact way last November 2021. My connecting flight is leaving JFK at 10:38 pm so I already know it's the last flight. I'm not even mad anymore. I'll just never use them again.

I told her that I just got there and she said “too bad”. Another passenger actually helped me while she continued to berate me. I walked over and asked her name, she then held up her badge and very rudely told me her name and said “go ahead complain its not gonna get you anywhere”. I was mortified and felt belittled by the whole interaction. I used to like this airline but that is quickly changing. It is not the first time JetBlue staff has been rude.

There new carryon policy is a scam, might as well buy a more expensive airplane because you have to pay for carry on anyways. Also the lady who rescheduled my flight completely messed it up. I had three flights, the first one was delayed and in the second location (Fort Lauderdale) they rescheduled me on another flight that would make it on time to still make my original third flight. I asked if my luggage would make it and how to get my boarding pass. She said no problem your luggage will make it on your flight and you will just pick it up on your concourse at the end of your third flight, just get a boarding pass at the gate where you leave from (which was a different airline). Clearly should have checked in with jet blue staff before I walked 15 mins across the airport to my next flight where they told me they see my name on the flight list but I am not allowed to board because whoever rescheduled my flight messed something up.

The representative they have was rude and not even try to alleviate the customer irritation towards the situation, to sit here for 12 hours with a child it’s ridiculous.

Trying to get a fraudulent charge handled and have been on hold for 6 hours already. 1st time on hold for 2.5 hrs to be told I need to call back the same number and ask for “crew Support”. So I did only to wait again for 2 hrs and be told they had to transfer the call to crew support. When I was transferred the call dropped. Had to call back again, wait 2 hrs again the employee again told me they had to transfer me. I told them story on hold for over 5 hrs. They said they would hang on the line until “crew support “ answered and here I am still on hold waiting for “crew support “ to answer 2 hours and 50 minutes later. So angry. This is how they run their business? Awful!",-1
2022-05-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,JetBlue has offered no help with this whatsoever,False,"  I recently purchased two unaccompanied minor plane tickets leaving from Richmond to LAX on August 6th 2022. After receiving multiple emails ever since I booked this flight on how the flight has changed and for me to confirm it I realized the last change made it from a non-stop flight to a stop in Chicago. Unaccompanied minors cannot make stops like that. The airline company should have made arrangements before I have to call and do it myself. I called and it said it would be 160 minute wait it gave me a text option that it claimed would be faster than phone. After texting and told me it would be up over a two hour wait. Once I finally got a hold of an agent through text messaging they told me the only option they had was to cancel my reservation and refund me in full. I received an email confirming that they canceled one unaccompanied minor not two. So now I am on hold for another 2 hours to try to get them to cancel the other flight because both of my kids need to fly to the same destination together. JetBlue has offered no help with this whatsoever, I will never fly with them again.",-1

My daughter fainted from lack of oxygen, the staff were quick at responding, caring, and continuously attentive to both my daughter in need and her terrified mother, me.

I called customer service to get one transaction canceled (since I am not paying for two seats for myself) and the customer service representative, particularly the supervisor, says that it will cost $100 dollar for a refund because I chose basic. I explain to her that it is their app that continues giving me error and that I already book one flight with them and they hang up the phone. I have never disrespected no one on the phone, and never will, but the supervisor gives me an attitude and hangs up the call. A shame of representatives as the image of the company.

People complaining about other low budget airlines, but Jet Blue is definitely on top of the list, or rather the very bottom. Didn't make it to two flights due to airlines fault. First, they send you a boarding ticket for one time and when you are at the gate ahead of time, oops, sorry, boarding already closed, no notice or updates.  The only solution was to book a flight next day, which doesn't work with all prebooked arrangements. Compensation? Forget it. Waste of time trying to talk to someone at the airport or on the phone. Ended up going across the city to another airport to get a last minute flight with another carrier. Avoid, unless you want to be treated like $ sign, I am suspecting they do that when they are overbooked",-1

Their system couldn’t track my suitcase but then I got a phone call saying that they found it and that I could get it at the JFK airport. I traveled for a whole hour from Manhattan to JFK to find out that JetBlue still doesn’t know where the suitcase is. Still hoping to get my suitcase back. I’m a mother or a four year old baby and this has been a huge hassle for me. If you call their phone number , you’ll have a wait time or about 20- 30 minutes. So this is how JetBlue helper me to start our vacation : we don’t shower for a whole day because we don’t have our suitcases , we don’t get to see Manhattan , instead, we’re just travelling to the airport and waiting there to see if anybody can find our suitcase.",-1

So we have to wait at the terminal, not the gate to get our connecting flight and to drop our bags again. Not one attendant we came in contact with seemed to enjoy their job or their passengers. It was a green for us to even talk to them. There were many open seats on our flight and we were told we could not move to these special “orange seats” when we asked because people pay more for them. Obviously no one had purchased them since we’d already taken off. But I watched 3 other people move to these seats during the flight and not a word was said to them. So because we asked we didn't move but they can move there with no words said? Their flight attendants are so rude and we had to pay for everything. It’s like you do things the right way and pay what you’re supposed to pay and turns out no one cares anyway so we could’ve just done it without paying. Nice plane but absolutely no customer service. Rudest airline I’ve ever flown with. And apparently I’m not the only one and JetBlue does not care since every review on here says the same thing.",-1

This turned into a 13hr trip with a 6hr layover (Austin->LAX turned into Austin->Boston->LAX). I received no notification that the flight was cancelled and had to hussle to find an alternative route home on the last day of my vacation when I was due to fly home. Judging by other reviews they are doing this multiple times per week across several routes. I will never fly with this airline again. It's not worth the risk of cancellation. The booking agent at Chase travel advised that this is a recurring and systematic issue with JetBlue and Alaskan airlines specifically. Jetblue routinely overbooks lower margin flights and cancels them without notice. I looked at the flight history for my specific route and noticed several days where the flight did not operate in prior weeks on the same weekday. This is a clear pattern of cancellations and an underresourced airline. Its not worth the stress/headache when you're on vacation, hoping that your return flight won't be cancelled. I will not be flying with this airline again and advising others to book with a more reliable airline.",-1

I got an email at 3:00 a.m. on the day I was going home, cancelling my flight for 10 hours later. There was no attempt to help me rebook, no way to contact Jet Blue, and no apology. When I called the airline I was told that there were no available operators and they would call me back. They did but it took them 1.5 hours. They then offered to fly me home- 2 days later! Fortunately another airline was able to find us a last-minute flight that evening. JetBlue has absolutely no customer service and should not even be in business. This is the second time I have had serious issues trying to fly with them and I will use any other airline in the future.",-1

I called and asked for them to keep the departing flight but reimburse the returning flight. Stayed on hold 2 hours spoke to a supervisor. They said I’d see the change. Waited 5 days called again, stayed on hold another hour, they said they fixed it. Got an email that the whole trip was cancelled. Called again they said that I’d have to buy a new ticket and they couldn’t reimburse the difference. Spoke to a Supervisor who said she was ignoring me, then said she had no authority to reimburse me and could not fix my problem. In all, I spoke with 5 JetBlue employees & 2 Supervisors none of them knew what the hell the were doing. JetBlue is changing flights on a whim.",-1

We went to airport to catch our flight to JFK, which we had another flight (Delta to ATL) once we land in JFK. Flight with Delta was for 9:20pm. When we arrived at the airport in Bridgetown and found our flight was delayed four times, we were livid. We tried to cancel flight with Jetblue, and go with AA because booked the last flight home, but they were full. By this time, we knew we were going to miss our flight home and may have to sleep in airport with homeless people (I was in tears, I had never). While in the air with Jetblue, the pilot alarmed us even more, by telling us we may get there one hour later because of a storm. We arrived about 10:30pm, we had to cancel our delta flight, and rebook for 6am. While exiting the flight, I let the pilot know I was disappointed in my first flight with jetblue, and his response was ""third is a charm"". We didn't leave JFK until 8:20am (I didn't sleep while at JFK, I allowed my husband a little). I am still sad from this horrible experience. The saddest part, I had to sleep in airport with the homeless.",-1

This was my first experience on an aeroplane and it was horrible. Our flight going to Vegas at the last minute changed and gave us a 10-hour layover in Boston. Then on the way home due to the flight leaving Las Vegas late I missed the connecting plane home. And that was the last flight out for the day. So needless to say I am stuck in JFK from 9:30 am Saturday until Sunday am for the next flight home. Never again will I ever fly JetBlue - very disappointed.,-1
2022-04-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Orlando,4.0,,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,they are now a horror-show,False,"  I am a TrueBlue member and once preferred Jetblue to all the other airlines. Unfortunately, they are now a horror-show. The short version of the story is that my flight was cancelled and I was stranded for 3 days. A Jetblue representative at the airport told me I would be reimbursed for accommodations and transportation needs, up to a specified limit. The actual cost for 3 days was higher than the limit, but knowing I would be getting some kind of reimbursement took the edge off, and after dealing with uncertainty for the day and a half prior I was exhausted and just ready to have any kind of plan. I never got the instructions they said would be provided via email so I called them on the phone. Good luck with that. There was an option to have a live support person message me when my turn came up in the queue, so OK. It took 3 attempts with a total wait time of over 8 hours to actually get some assistance. Except 'assistance' is not what I got. The support person said they do not offer vouchers/reimbursements for flight cancellations and there is nothing they can do. Mind you, this is after I was promised , face to face, that I would receive a very specific amount of money. So, I was stranded for 3 days due to their failure, promised a modest (not total) reimbursement, then they failed to deliver even that. Do not trust anything they say, if you have a choice in what airline to fly, maybe choose another. The chances of you getting stranded with JetBlue seems high these days and who has the time and money to deal with such uncertainty. On top of it all I wasted many hours of time trying to get what I was promised, with no small amount of stress.",-1

Originally my flight was June 10 11:10am - June 10 7:30pm. Now it’s changed to June 10 10:53pm - June 11 7:07am. I am suppose to surprise one of my family member’s birthday on June 10th, but now I can’t. I call to see if they could do anything about it, and so they will charge for $537 to change my flight? You guys are a joke. If you can change my flight, then I ask to change my flight without a charge. Seriously, if you guys are reading this and not improvising by the time I fly out in 2 months, I am never flying with JetBlue ever again, and my review will never be deleted.",-1
2022-04-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to New York,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,I’ll never fly with JetBlue again!,True,  Going to Orlando we got delayed almost two hours and we were okay with it given that it’s only two hours. We were supposed to fly back on Monday 6 am but got an email at 12:30am that our flight was cancelled and they booked us on a flight on Thursday to Newark instead of JFK. Not only did I have to call out two extra days from work I had to cancel the flight they booked and pay 300$ one way ticket for each of us. Our resort could not add another day so we had to book a two minimum night hotel in addition to an Uber to take us there. Such an inconvenience. When I called for a voucher or some sort of accommodation for the hotel they said they cancelled because of weather and our own safety. But all other airlines were flying so I guess JetBlue is the only airline that cares about the human lives. They refused to give anything for hotel or anything. Even spirit airlines were flying out that day with no delays. Even with my insurance on the ticket I only got a hundred dollar refund from the ticket I had paid. Okay I’ll never fly with JetBlue again!,-1
2022-04-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to New York,,,,,,2.0,1,cancellation of flight seems normal practice,False,"  We booked this flight as part of an itinerary with American Airlines and were due to connect to a flight to London from JFK. I was unable to check in online as the booking reference was not recognised on the JetBlue website. Only found out the flight was cancelled when we reached the check-in desk at Orlando. The reason given for cancellation was “mechanical “ but this seemed a stock response without any details to back it up. No alternative flight options could be offered although the agent did try. Consequently, we were a unable to make our flight from JFK to LHR and had to overnight which was a great inconvenience due to work and school commitments. JetBlue were unwilling to offer any hotel room and suggested we make a claim for the hotel costs afterwards. I suspect if we got anything at all it would be a travel voucher which is useless to us! Our booking ref with American Airlines was cancelled during the search for alternative flights so I was unable to resolve the issue with them. Thankfully we are now booked on a direct flight MCO to LHR with BA but the cancellation of the JetBlue flight seems normal practice and done without any efforts to inform passengers or re-route them.",-1

Flight 686 on April 23 2022 delayed by 5 hours, as a result I lost my connection with Europe. Almost all flights with Jet Blue have been delayed, while Delta and American Airlines departed on time. Once arrived at JFK I noticed that many other Jet Blue flights have been delayed or canceled. I bought the ticket on European site of American Airlines and I didn't receive any information. Be careful, if you have to be somewhere on time or have connection flights just don't take Jet Blue! It comes with a big risk and it costs me 2,500 $ and a day lost because of their inability to respect schedules. It's not any airport issue, it's only Jet Blue responsibility. Awful, never again!",-1

I flew almost 6 hours with a broken TV and non working outlets to charge phones. An extremely long flight to not have the tv working. I paid for all amenities included and did not get them. I paid a fortune for the flight. They indulge by offering a $15 credit. Disgusting business practices.,-1

My family and I booked a trip from Worcester MA to Las Vegas with connections at JFK NY. Very unhappy with my Jetblue experience. Round trip flight started out with a 2hour delay that turned into more than 3 hours. Our lay over was already 5hrs so we were in JFK for more than 8hrs. Everyone knows more time in an airport means more money spent on food/drinks with a 500% inflation price. We thought for sure once we got on the plan at least our meals and ear phones would have been free. Instead we got a 50$ credit for a future flight. Our flight back was more than equally subpar compared to this. Again started with a 2hr delay. Connecting flight at JFK. The delay made it so we would have 10min to get from gate 20 to gate 2 in terminal 5 at JFK which is relatively close. We decided to check our luggage so we would have less to carry in order to transition from gate to gate quickly. We were told they knew we were coming and would wait. So we ran to the next gate and arrived before take off but the plane took off early and left us. This delayed us to the next day, next flight would not be leaving until 1200. We were booked a room over night and told to pick up our luggage at the baggage claim. After waiting patiently for 30 min at carousel 5, Our luggage never came. Another customer service person told us they did not know why we were told to pick up our luggage. This posed a problem for us as we had prescription medications in our checked baggage and we were told we would have to wait 2 hrs to get our luggage. At this point it was past midnight and we could not wait this long with two young kids. So we called for the shuttle service to the hotel and waited again patiently for 30 min, we decided to call again, turns out the shuttle picked up one passenger and left even though he was told we had four in our party. At this point it looks like JetBlue is the new Spirit Airlines after all. Spirit Airlines is know for flight cancellations, delays, and uncomfortable flights with unrealistic spacing in between seats. Getting compensation toward a new flight at this point is simple not enough.",-1

After we boarded the aircraft we were told something is wrong with the engine and we all have to leave the airplane. Everyone on that plane was traveling for spring break vacation to Disney. Why was the plane not checked before they boarded the passengers? What’s ironic is that our friends were flying from Newark airport to Orlando. Their flight was supposed to depart 2 hours before ours on JetBlue. They were told the same thing and they were delayed 3 hours. I think that JetBlue is using the excuse for pilot not feeling comfortable flying the plane for over booking! Our family is loosing a whole day at Disney for which we paid a lot of money for. Our poor children are losing it waiting for a new gate. The worst part is their customer service. I came up several times to an agent who refused to give his full name as though he knew he is being rude to everyone asking him for an update and he would just respond with a dismissive tone that he knows nothing and will not tell us anything. Jetblue needs to train their employees to be kinder and more compassionate as we are the ones who have our flight delayed! We have been sitting here for over 2 hours! No one has any answers on when we will depart. They took a whole day away from our families in Disney! They could have prevented this issue by checking their plain in advance! JetBlue is not the same airline it used to be! Major disappointment! Never fly JetBlue again!,-1

A 2-hour delay for starting the trip, then 2 hours on the tarmac, then they send us back allegedly for a small technical issue which turned out to be just a “small matter to be logged at captains book” (keep in mind we stayed 2 hours in gate before starting the trip) and that lead to a refuel operation, another 1.5-hour delay. Total 5.5 hours delay, 3 of them aboard! When finally we were left to deboard to buy some stuff they insisted on taking no more than 30 minutes, and we couldn’t buy a decent meal with such short time, and that for nothing because we spent 1 hour more after reembarking!",-1

The representative was not understanding me, he wasn't listening. He canceled my son's flight, told me he'd rebook it, and then told me he couldn't rebook it. Gave me another 1800 number to call and rebook and they wanted to charge me a $150 unaccompanied minor fee even though my child wasn't traveling unaccompanied. That representative hung up the phone on me when I questioned the charge if my child was not traveling unaccompanied. Worst customer service ever.

But in the worst turn of fate imaginable, they switched me over to Jetblue anyway. My flight is cancelled, I am stuck in Boston (for the fifth time this year) and I am only being offered the opportunity to reschedule three days from now on Jetblue.

The people at the airport were less than helpful in trying to get us on a flight home earlier or giving us a refund for our tickets and the luggage that they already took the money for for a flight that was never leaving. We ended up having to pay $1,200 out of pocket to get a flight home that day with Delta. I put in claims for refunds but have heard nothing yet and we had travel insurance. Complete disaster and apparently it's happening to multiple flights all over the country with this airline. Don't take people's money and book flights if you don't have the employees to run them, it's that simple.",-1

We were all packed up and ready to go home from NYC. Checked the flight before we went to sleep. 5am hit. We dragged out of bed and I noticed I had an email from JetBlue. It said your flight was canceled! This email was sent at 1am when we were asleep. They claimed that they rebooked us for tomorrow however, both myself and my wife need to get home so we could prepare for work on Monday! And, now I don't trust this airline that they won't cancel us again tomorrow! I don't know what happened to this airline, I've flown with them for years and it's always been a good airline. Now? A 3rd world airline company. You'd have better luck booking a Russian airline and actually getting on board then you would a JetBlue and that's sad! You got us twice before JetBlue, 3rd time makes it my fault if I continue flying with your company. Done! Never again! And oh, ""Flight credits"" is only good if #1 you don't cancel your flights! #2 filing bankruptcy because honestly? You won't be in business much longer treating your customers this way!",-1

After delaying it three times, at midnight (around 11:59 pm) they said the flight is cancelled. It cost me over 1k $. I was all alone by myself and it was late night. I had to take a taxi from airport to a hotel at NYC, (and most hotels were booked at that time), the hotel and taxi cost me a lot. I had to take a hotel at NYC and I took another ticket with another airline the following day. I called JetBlue many times and I wanted them to compensate the cost and difficulties I went through. They were not responsive for the financial difficulties I went through at that time of night. Is it okay to leave your customers at midnight and not taking responsibility for the damage?",-1
2022-04-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,will never book with jetblue again,False,"  Our flight was canceled at the last minutes after two hour delay. No reason was given. Since JetBlue is the only airline serves this route, we don't have other option. The helping agent gave us another flight three days later. After long negotiation, they finally agree to book us another flight from a city 200 miles away and two days later. We have to arrange our own transportation. For all these trouble, we get a $50 credit for future JetBlue flight which expires in one year but not for ""Even More Space/Even More Speed"". We will never book with jetblue again.",-1

JetBlue canceled our flight at the last minute after delaying it 3 times. No explanation. Had to spend 2.5 hours to speak to customer service. They told us they could not rebook us and would refund our fare. We lost over $3k in hotel and car expenses we could not recoup. Last spring break with my daughter before she goes to college down the drain. Issued $100 credit per person and when I went to use it for our family of 5; I was told that I could not bundle them even though we have $500. Only one can be used. I spent over 90 minutes trying to talk to someone and awful customer service again. Never flying JetBlue again!! Stay away!!,-1

2022-04-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to New York JFK,,,,,,2.0,1,absolutely nothing by way of compensation,True,  My flight on JetBlue out of New Orleans on 4/9 was canceled without explanation. There was no way to reach anyone at JetBlue for more than 6 hours so I was left to find my own way home. I booked a flight on another airline as JetBlue had zero options available for 4/9. I incurred substantial additional expenses to book a last minute flight home. I then waited more than 8 hours for a JetBlue Crewmember to call me back to cancel the flight they automatically booked me on for 2 days after my original flight. Today I spent more than 2 hours on hold to try to get compensated for the additional $300 I had to spend to get home only to be told they will provide absolutely nothing by way of compensation. I will never fly this airline again!,-1
2022-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,JFK New York to Houston,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2,unprofessional and disrespectful,True,"  They delayed my flight for 1 hour and 5 mins then ended canceling it eventually. They don't even feel sorry for themselves. The lady just stand there and made an announcement like nothing big happened. I guess they have been doing it for a long time now so it's totally fine for them. After the cancellations, they don't even follow-up with the next steps. Most people were just walking around and didn't know what to do, including myself. Also, they updated the cancellation through email after 2 hours. Everything seems unprofessional and disrespectful to their customers. Do yourself a favor to stay away from this JetBlue. They don't need you and of course there are plenty of airlines out there that would treat you better than these guys. I got on the line for almost 2 hours just for re-booking. The girl at the counter couldn't even look up my flight info even though they just cancelled the flight in less than 30 mins. It took her a while to see what happened in their systems. After re-booking, I can't even check-in online for the next flight and have to see a crew member at kiosk assistance.",-1

2022-04-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,Portland to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,purposely delay flights,False," Portland to New York. JetBlue is the worst! Their waterfall effect for flights is ridiculous. Let me break it down for you. They purposely delay flights all day and night. The reason is so they can bump currently booked passengers to another flight and get standby passengers on your booked flight. This is how they minimize the financial impact of crediting flights and giving travel vouchers or hotel cost. This should be illegal as it’s the only way JetBlue can operate. They have no compassion or reason to be on time ever, if your traveling for vacation your better off spending the extra money to ensure your flights arrive on time to your destination. If you have a customer service issue expect 2-6 hours of your day spent just trying to contact them. Another way JetBlue gets you is by recording the time of landing when the wheels hit the tarmac, not when the plane arrives at the gate which in some cases can be 10-30 minutes. They will deny till they are blue in the face that your flight wasn’t late based off that time. My family and I will fly Delta or United from now on spend the extra cash to ensure our 7 month out planned vacation isn’t delayed based off a company that tricks and fools you into thinking your getting a good deal. JetBlue has an on time arrival and departure rate of 32% let that sink in if your thinking of a value flight.",-1

I am currently disgusted with the pre-flight process. We arrived from a ship thinking we could check our luggage stress-free and proceed back into Fort Lauderdale to do some tourist activities. WRONG. We have to sit on the hard floor for 6-hours because JetBlue and/or the airport does not have baggage hold or will not let us check our bags for our late flight. This is not a well thought out arrangement for a tourist central airport and flight line. They should be prepared to handle these influxes, and give partnered groups at least options for holding baggage or pre-checking it. The city loses money this way and leaves myself and others tired, hungry, and annoyed we stood in line for nothing and have no options. Will not ever fly this airline again. Complete lack of foresight.",-1

Our flight was delays then delayed again because another aircraft took our crewmember for our flight so then delayed another 2 hours - no compensation nothing. Calling by phone over a 2 hour wait. To handle it in the airport over a 2 hour wait. They are just as bad as American and that is the worst airline ever. They are tying with them and that's real bad.,-1

We waited on hold over 3 hours to talk to someone. There's absolutely no one to help. And to rebook a flight online, they want to charge more for the flight and make us pay the difference. Jetblue cancelled our flight home, jetblue should be putting us on a flight for the same price and should have contacted us to tell us. I will never travel jetblue again.

As I was driven to the airport, the flight was delayed until 8:20pm. Then it was delayed to 9:05pm, 9:15pm and on and on until the flight was canceled after midnight. The employee at the gate told us it was because there weren't enough pilots. We were sent from one help desk to another to be told that there was nothing that could be done for us, we were treated rudely, without having our concerns heard or addressed. Sometime in the early AM hours of 4/3, my flight was rebooked for 4/5/22. I spent 4/2 -4/3 trying to reach customer service but didn't hear back from them until after 7am on 4/3. And yes, I was at the airport all night. JetBlue doesn't care about their customers at all. They would not give vouchers, transportation, or anything for those of us who had no where to go. They wouldn't even hear us out. One help desk was closed after standing in line for hours, we were pulled out of another help desk and sent somewhere else only to be told there was nothing to be done for us. No one even tried to be helpful. I spent over $300 to get back to Connecticut since my flight to LAX wasn't until Tuesday. I finally heard from customer service as I was being driven to CT and had to turn around for a flight that had been available the night before but which employees refused to reschedule for me to get me an earlier flight. I recently received $300 in credit for my next flight with JetBlue. I will never fly JetBlue again.",-1
2022-04-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to New York LGA,3.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,experience with JetBlue was awful,True,"  The second week in a row jetblue has changed/cancelled my flight 2hours and 30min prior to departure. The exact same 19:00h flight from BOS to LGA was delayed last week and the cancelled. I was put on a flight the following morning which was cancelled before I left the airport. I then went back into the airport and rescheduled the reservation a week later hoping the issues would sort themselves out. This was not the case. On my way to the airport 7days after the initial flight reservation was planned, at almost the exact same location in time and space, approximately 2h30min prior to my departure I received another delayed flight notice. This time the delay was for 5h30min. I was also not able to check in for this flight on the webpage, in the app, or on the kiosk at the airport. I waited 1h in line to speak with someone who gave me a seat on a flight to my destination. This new flight was originally scheduled for 17:00h departure, is actually leaving at 20:57h as on this moment. I have been waiting in lines cumulatively since the original booking for 6hours. The only consolation for the first cancelled flight was a travel credit with JetBlue for less than half the original cost. The customer service in person at the kiosk were very nice and tried to help. Especially The one who got me on on of the delay flights from earlier in the day as a standby flier. Unfortunately it appears to be an issue with the management of the planes and crew. The online customer service was helpful to a bare minimum. I asked multiple questions that went unanswered. The was a canned response given by the live customer service rep that was repeated used. Now I am sitting near the gate in a terminal filled with flights. All of these flights are delayed by a minimum of 1hour. This was a similar situation one week prior. I would not recommend this airline. I only flew once with jetblue 2 years ago in 2019 without any issue. Today JetBlue does not seem to have a handle on their scheduling across the entire east coast. The most common response for the reason of delays has been crew issues. Some responses are initially weather but then develop with further questioning to crew related issues. My experience with JetBlue was awful! Never again! I wish I could take the travel credit to delta airlines.",-1

Stay away from this airline they suck! Customer service they may as well not have it! My wife and stepdaughter's flight from FLL to RDU was cancelled after a 9-hour flight from Brazil. They were bumped to another flight and at check in they were told it was booked full already. After 5 hours in limbo they finally got a flight of inconvenience from FLL to BOS to RDU they would not compensate us for their mess up nor give a voucher. I wouldn’t fly a dead body on their airline much less myself ever again! Avoid them, Breeze and Azul - they are all owned by the same company and person",-1

My return flight was scheduled for Sunday, 3 April 2022. Sunday AM I received an email stating that my flight was cancelled. We had to cancel our own plans to tour beautiful old Savannah to head to the airport seeing as I tried to call JetBlue and my estimated wait time was over 3 hours. While on the way to the airport I received a follow up email from JetBlue, instead of my 2.5 hour flight from Sav to Boston I was to fly to Detroit (not even remotely on the way) and then to Worcester, MA (note: not the city from which I had flown out). But then the real punch to the face...the flight was Tuesday! Would the JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes allow a business to just tell him to pay for a hotel for two nights and miss work because it was convenient for them? Obviously not. I asked the JetBlue desk staff to cancel my flight and found a flight via Delta. Postscript...Tues AM I received an email from JetBlue to check into my flight, the one they told me that they had cancelled. I ended up on a 1.5 hour call with JetBlue to get it cancelled. They could not have given me a more terrible customer service experience if they tried. I will never, ever, ever fly with JetBlue ever again...they simply don't care about their customers.",-1

The delays I’ve sat through has cost me lots of valuable time that I won’t get back! I fly at least once a month with Jetblue and my wife travels twice a month with them. I have to say we are not happy with how we are treated with all the time wasted! I ask that Jetblue just be honest with your guests. Don’t book flights you don’t have staff for and for closing Newark airport is probably the worst airport in the United States. How many times we land and sit and wait for a spot! Then if you have to wait for luggage? Good luck with that!,-1
2022-04-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Boston via New York,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2,did not offer any support or information,True,"  Jetblue connecting flight from JFK to Boston on April 1-2, 2022 was a disaster. The flight was for 7am but we did not board until 11am. The plane had an engine misfire problem and we were kept on the plane for hours in the heat. Finally deplaned with no support or direction. We waited hours in the airport and were reboarded. The same problem occurred and we were kept on the plane in the heat for hours. This process was repeated again later in the evening after finally taking the plane out of service at 9pm when it was too late to make other travel plans. They would not cancel the flight. They would not return our luggage. They did not support us with food, accommodations or other travel options. We were essentially held hostage by this company at JFK airport for 32 hours. Wait times to speak to a rep were >300 minutes. No one was available at the airport for assistance. The flight was finally canceled at 1 am the following day. A new flight was provided for two days later which I declined. Prior to the flight being canceled, I had no option but to leave my luggage and take a $550 uber ride to boston. The following day I had to drive down to JFK 7 hours round trip to retrieve my luggage. This was one of the worst experiences of my life. Jetblue did not offer any support or information. They waited and waited and poorly managed everything. They were grossly incompetent and careless. Do not fly thru JFK with Jetblue unless you plan to stay at the airport for days.",-1

Four of us missed our connecting flight in Ft. Lauderdale coming home from Cancun because of a delayed flight out of Cancun due to a ""maintenance issue"" (or so we were told). The JetBlue customer service in Mexico told us we'd have to get on the next flight home from Ft. Lauderdale the following day and that we'd get hotel and transportation vouchers because it was entirely the airline's mistake for missing our connection. They printed us boarding passes for the new flight and we were on our way. We flew into Ft. Lauderdale, and found out there that we were not in fact booked on the flight home the next day (despite being given boarding passes), that we absolutely wouldn't be given vouchers of any kind, and that the next flight home was a whole two days later, and that all the hotels were booked because it was spring break.

They ruined my wedding that I was suppose to have and now I’m not getting married. So I suggest to stay away from this airline if you have big important events.  They delayed our flight 5x and then made us sit in the airplane for 3 hours to then kick us all off because “by law they have to give us 15 minutes to stretch”. And then they never let us back in. What a joke. They were just stalling us and leading us on when they knew the whole time they were canceling the flight… from the night before! Very abnormal behavior from them and all of their staff . And On top of that they would not give us our luggage back. The plane did not even close the gates or depart yet (after they switched the flight number without informing us and picked and chose who got to fly from original flight) and they did not have a care in the world to get our luggage’s and personal belongings back to us. They stated that we have to file a claim and pay for it to be shipped to my house. They are pathetic and unprofessional. Thank you Jet Blue for an unforgettable experience. And Bravo to you for losing half your customers let alone your staff.,-1

When it was 2:35pm close to the boarding time, JetBlue gate attendant said they were waiting for the 1st officer, after 30min she said the aircraft had a mechanical problem and would delay 1 more hour the departure time. Past this one hour, they said they aircraft wouldn’t be able to fly, but they had another one to replace, but they were waiting for a co pilot. After 3h30min waiting, they gave us a good voucher of $16 until after 4hours, they canceled the flight and rescheduled us for another flight 2 days later without being responsible for extra hotel, food or anything. The worse part is, if you go to their website and try to buy a ticket, it’s available for tomorrow. I’ve been on the phone waiting for an attendant for 6hours, yes, 6 hours. I have a screenshots of everything and could provide it all. I lost my hope that someone wants actually help. What a terrible hospitality service.",-1

Unfortunately they have fallen below even AA quality at this point. We were scheduled to fly out mid morning on a Sunday to catch a connection in JFK. Jetblue decided to cancel the flight about 1 hour before boarding due to an insufficient amount of crew. They of course blamed it on weather elsewhere and had cancelled flights the two prior days as well. All other airlines at BTV were on time and flying out no problem. They could reschedule us for the next day but how could you trust what they say at this point. At least give me some notice so I can drive to the second leg of my trip, not what until the 11th hour. So we got them to send us from Boston instead but they would not compensate us for a rental car, only credit for future flights on Jetblue. Why would I want some credit to fly with them again? Jetblue is now on my list of airlines not to fly and I'll probably only use them again to burn out all of my points or if they're cheaper than all other airlines.",-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Salt Lake City to Rochester, NY",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,a very unreliable and an incompetent airline,False,"  JetBlue Airways is a very unreliable and an incompetent airline. We were travelling from SLC to Rochester (ROC) on Apr 2022 but when we arrived to NYC, our connection to Rochester at 9.30 pm had been cancelled. They didn't provide any solutions or alternatives to the problem. We were waiting more than an hour to speak with a representative that finally gave us standby tickets for the next day and booked us for a 10.30 pm flight in case standby tickets fail. We spent an unplanned night at NYC spending more money on hotel and transportation than anticipated for our vacations. After several hours of waiting in anguish, JB only confirmed two seats to fly to ROC of the stand by tickets. The other two of my family received a confirmation for a flight at 1pm. However, JB postponed it three times, changing departure gate and time many times that we lost the count, and ultimately they cancelled the flight again at 2 am with no explanations or solutions. My family waited the whole day at the airport and again another unplanned night in NYC. Naïve us that we believed in JetBlue, assuming that they were competent to meet our needs. There was no bad weather or any other big disruption out of their control except their own incompetence. So, another night in NYC trying desperately to find a solution to fulfill the trip to Rochester. We finally had to buy tickets from another carrier because JB was uncapable to tell us what to expect from them. Two days lost, a lot of inconveniences, risk and peril we never thought we had to experience if you planned your trip with a serious and competent business. It is unacceptable that they charge fare and provide such a mediocre service. We have not finished our trip yet, so we will see how this ordeal with JetBlue ends. There is no guarantee that you will be able to fulfill your planned trip with JetBlue Airlines.",-1

I have been flying JetBlue as a mosaic member for many years flying several times per year to LAX, Florida and the islands. Over the past couple of years I have noticed a steep decline in service, attitude, timeliness and delays. Today I arrived at the airport for an 8:59 flight to West Palm for business. I was then notified of an almost three-hour delay. The small airport filled up with many travelers over the next hour or so. No place to sit, standing room was crowded as well. Little by little, we listened to all of the cancelations. No staff showing up to work? In what world is this acceptable? The chaos ensued and the disrespect and empathy for customers disappeared. There’s no accountability or understanding that no one is flying for fun. People had plans, people paid a lot of money, people had business on the other side. You cannot reach anyone to help - even on the Mosaic Line and the app didn’t work. Changing my cc from Jet Blue immediately and not flying with them any longer.",-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Port-au-Prince,,,,,,1.0,1,very disappointed with the airline,False,"  On April 3rd I stood on line for an hour to check in my luggage, no one told me my flight was canceled, I went the security check point and still no announcement was made in regards to my flight being canceled. It does not make any sense to have hundreds of people go through all of this pointless waiting on line for no reason to be told after settling down to board that the flight as been canceled and on top of that, we were told that we would have to stand on another line to be told where we can go to retrieve our luggage. I am fed up with JetBlue and all of their cancelations, they couldn't even compensate the passengers with anything. Not even something to eat or drink. I remembered years ago, the airlines would put you up in a hotel free of charge to return to the airport the next day to take your flight to your destination. I am very disappointed with the airline, I have faithfully flown with jetblue for many years and now I am completely turned off. I will have to find another airline to do my business with because Jetblue has dropped the ball one too many times for my liking.",-1

The gate attendant couldn't have been more rude. When we were finally boarded, we sat in the airplane for nearly hour. On our return flight from the Dominican Republic to Ft Lauderdale we weren't even told our connecting flight to Chicago was cancelled. Not one explanation why. We had to scramble like everyone else on the fight. We ended up stranded and booked a room 20 mins away. After being on hold for over 5 hours, and in the middle of the night customer service finally answered. We were told that we'd get an email explaining to us what to do. Another nearly 6 hours passed and all the email said was that JetBlue wasn't able to find another flight and couldn't / didn't have the capability to book on any other airline. It wasn't their responsibility to get us home and they wiped their hands off the situation. We are livid! My husband is a multi million mile flyer on 2 bigger airlines, we only used this company because we were a part of a large, multiple family vacation that was planned by another family member.

2022-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Rochester,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,I would not recommend JetBlue to anybody,False,"  Our flight from JFK to ROC was delayed multiple times, we waited about 2 hours to find out that our flight was cancelled and zero accommodations were given and zero help as to getting to our next location. Hundreds of people were sleeping on the airport floor and sobbing due to exhaustion and no idea how to get where they needed to go. 5 flights were cancelled last minute along with ours. It was horrible and I would not recommend JetBlue to anybody.",-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1,never recommend Jetblue to anyone,False,  They canceled our flight 10 mins before boarding time. Gave us absolutely no reimbursement for hotel or transportation. Left us in Seattle with the next flight two days away. Nor are willing to pay the $500 difference we had to pay for a new flight. Customer service reps were extremely rude. I will never recommend Jetblue to anyone.,-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Buffalo,,,,,,1.0,1,disgusting how we were treated,False,"  My sister and i had a flight scheduled from JFK to Buffalo at 9:05pm. We got there at 6:15, rushed to the gate, saw it was delayed until 10:30 (not an issue). Then we found out it was delayed again two more times until 12:55. People had a Buffalo flight at 6 pm and theirs got canceled so they had to go on ours. We found out our plane was coming from Boston and idk if it's because there was no staff but it was absolutely ridiculous! The girls working gave us information but basically lead us on saying the plane just hadn't left. It got to be 1am, and we had enough. The called Boston and confirmed their flight was canceled so ours was too. Instead of staying and helping these passengers, they left quickly and their manager or supervisor ignored us. They said ""book a new flight and get a hotel room"". Never did they say they'd give us our money back or help us. Instead they left us all alone and confused. all Jetblue flights were then canceled. It is absolutely ridiculous and disgusting how we were treated and strung along to think our flight was coming. The even let a 15 year old boy, all by himself without answering his questions. My sister and I kindly helped him as best we could. This company is horrible. Always known for postponing flights and then canceling in the middle of the night when customers are angry and tired. I will not be flying JetBlue ever ever ever again.",-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lima to Salt Lake City via Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1,Avoid this unreliable airline,True,"  Horrible customer service! Cancelled our international flight 4 hours prior to departure and customer service went radio-silent. Notification of cancellation was sent to us without offering a remedy of alternatives or options. Two-hour wait to speak to an actual human being via phone. Online chat option worthless. Website worthless. Airport reps gave weather as reason for cancellation, but truthfulness is highly suspect. Sources on the ground at destination verified simple rain storms without wind, lightening, or other extreme conditions.  Avoid this unreliable airline company at all cost!",-1

We arrived in New York from our Tampa transfer around 12:30pm and we were scheduled to board our Milwaukee flight from New York at 4:38pm and arrive in Milwaukee at 6:10pm. We had so many delays, we didn't arrive in Milwaukee until 9:30pm. At one point they told us we could board the Milwaukee plane and we must've sat waiting on the plane for over an hour due to employees not loading customer luggage yet onto the plane. Ridiculous, will not be using jetblue again.",-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Ft Myers,,,,,,1.0,1,I will never fly jetblue again,False,"  We have been at Logan airport since 7am, supposed to leave at 9:40. We were initially delayed because they did not have a crew here, waiting for crew to arrive. Delayed to 10:10 but crew was not here. Then allegedly there were weather issues in FLA but several other flights to FLA have left. Then at 7 pm our crew left as they maxed out their hours so now jetblue has us on hold to see if they can find another crew. They will not answer questions and are beyond rude. We cannot get a refund bc our flight has not been cancelled, nor can we rebook and take another airline bc our checked luggage is being held hostage. I have been a big jet blue flyer, I have lots of unused miles. I will let them all go because I will never fly jetblue again.",-1

We booked this flight more than 6 months in advance and they cancelled us last minute due to a Pilot walking out!

The flight was cancelled rebooked and sat on tarmac 7 times and still no flight. Their customer service recording says that you will wait at least 240 minutes before you get an answer.""JetScrew"" richly deserves the recent awards for the airline with the worst on time performance and the worst customer service.

Their crew were some of the nicest that I have  met in the sky. The seats on their A321 NEO with mint have full lie flat functions with direct aisle access and a closing door. I was surprised how spacious the seats were, and the flight from London to JFK was one of the best flights I have been on. All passengers have access to free wifi for the entire flight. JetBlue is the only US carrier that offers this, and it worked very well. They also had a gigantic IFE screen with live TV and on demand movies and TV shows. The food was incredible. I would be more than happy to do this again.",1

JetBlue managed to lose one of the two suitcases I checked in at JFK after arriving with Emirates from Dubai. No idea how they managed to check in properly one of the suitcases and leave one at JFK. Hardly any info provided online. The next day finally I got an email that my suitcase was delivered. However the lady at the reception says she hasn't got anything, There are about 8 different hotels in the area I am staying at and I am running around trying to locate it. Finally found it at the hotel across the road. I would have probably laughed if didn't feel like crying. Never again I am flying this airlines.",-1
2022-03-30,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to Cancun,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,lack of service,False," Sacramento to Cancun. On the way to Cancun we were stuck on the tarmac which we all hate but I understand that things happen. On the way home we got an email saying our flight would be delayed an hour however we needed to show up at the original time just in case they made up time somewhere. We showed up and the flight got pushed back even further so we spent our last day sitting in the airport. When we arrived in Sacramento and got our bags my son's brand new suitcase was cracked down the front. I tried to find someone to show however, it was after 10:00 and staff was nowhere. I called the next morning and after a 2 hour hold was directed to call the baggage claim at the Sacramento airport. I left a message every day for 4 days and even though their answering machine stated an employee would call within 24 hours, I never got a phone call. I went through contact us on JetBlue's site and received an email that said sorry and gave me a $50 credit to use Jetblue again. I would never use this airline again. There lack of service is unacceptable.",-1
2022-03-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Miami, FL to Hartford, CT",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2,"Thanks, but no thanks, JetBlue",True," Recently was booked on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Boston that was delayed for over 5 hours then cancelled at 1.30am on a Sunday Morning, JetBlue indicated the soonest they could get us to Boston was Tuesday or Wednesday. Needing to be home sooner we ended up having them transfer us to a flight from Miami to Hartford leaving on Monday at 12.30pm. This cost us over $850 out of pocket and 2 days lost wages. On Monday that flight was delayed 5 hours meaning we ultimately got home Tuesday at 1am, when we should have been home Saturday at 11.40pm. We got an email saying they were sorry our Monday flight was delayed and eventually got a $150 credit - total for 2 people. First, $150 cannot purchase anything so clearly this is more about marketing and getting us to spend additional money if we want to use that credit. Second, we get no apology or compensation for the flight that was also delayed 5 hours, then canceled causing the out of pocket and wage losses mentioned as well as frustration and time lost trying to reroute. I also was forced to pay for my checked bag twice - once on the cancelled flight and again to check in to the Monday flight, I was informed I ""should"" get a refund for the bag charge but it would take 7-10 days. I waited 10 days and then used the chat app - which had a 30-40 minute wait - to ask about my refund I was told that it was issued 10 days ago and when I informed the rep that is what I was calling, I was told to just wait a few more days. I also brought up all of the above and asked why I was credited for 1 flight and not the other and was told that was all that they were doing. My last chat message to the rep was ""So wait longer than I was told and also accept a credit that would require me to spend more money since $150 gets me nowhere and trust that I wouldn't again be stranded for 2 extra days at my cost while getting nothing for the flight that stranded me? Do I have all that correct?"" And the answer...""That's correct"" Thanks, but no thanks, JetBlue. I do realize that all airlines are cancelling flights due to staffing but this response from JetBlue and the lack of understanding/compassion that you can't simply strand people for days at their own cost is very upsetting.",-1
2022-03-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Phoenix,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3,bad experience started from check-in,False,"  The bad experience started from check-in. It was a code share flight with AA and online check-in was not successful with multiple attempts from both AA and JetBlue's websites. This was the second leg of our international flights with the layover at JFK. The gate agent (AA) at the origin of the trip (Barcelona) attempted to check us through but failed, and advised us to consult JetBlue after we land - great partnership between AA and JetBlue! 9 hours later at JFK. Tired to get in a line that was marked ""Customer Help"" only to be blocked by a ground staff. Explained the situation and he pointed at a long line nearby and coldly, I mean chilling cold, borderline hostile, replied ""you've got to get in that line"". JetBlue's departure hall at JFK terminal 5 was a chaos with multiple lines for unknown purposes and few staff to help direct the confused passengers. With the check-in problem finally sorted out, we then had to go through the most bizarre security line I'd even experienced, and I had flown a time or two with roughly 500k miles under my belt. The line turned out to be a maze by design. Just when you thought it'd be your turn to get ID checked the line would be closed and you get redirected. It was comical only that it wasn't funny to me at all being treated like a rat running around aimlessly in it, and there were hundreds of us trapped in there. And then came the perpetually shifting boarding times, and the extremely uncomfortable beaten-up seat. But we made it home, 5 hours after originally scheduled, albeit exhausted.",-1
2022-03-20,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bradley Airport to Orlando,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3,Won't be using them any more,False,  Booked this vacation over a year ago. Original bepart time was 7.45 am Then got moved to 9.30 am . Had a weather delay due to weather at our destination. We'll we were still within time to make our cruise. They loaded us on the plane and then announced they had to do administrative paperwork. We'll that made us wait another 1.5 hrs on the ground. Well when we finally got in the air we received a message we were not going to make our cruise. So we missed our boat. Then after being able to get onto another ship and spending 1000.00 dollars on hotel rooms and a rental car we went on. We get back for return flight and of course another flight delay. By the time we boarded it was another 3 and half hours. While waiting we also see that every flight from jetblue just kept getting delay longer and longer. What a bad first impression. Won't be using them any more and by looking at reviews by other people they don't care about customers just the cash.,-1
2022-03-20,0.4,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Pittsburgh,4.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,The customer’s time is not respected!,True," I was asked to come to the airport at original time 9.08 but the new departure time is after 2:00pm. I travel to Boston for work every weekend and usually 16 hours on Saturday. To me, sleep an hour more before catching the plane back would be a big deal. After I went to the gate C 36, I did not even certain that was the one. So I came to Jetblue service desk, asked for the gate information and delay situation. I was told that the airplane is still in one of the cities in New York State as of 10.00 am. The customer service man was explaining to me that the crew were not able to come over to Boston to work because of the delay last night. That is the reason we are delayed. But I am wondering why I have to be punished by waiting in the airport. The answer was they might be able to get another plane to take us. I am very angry. At the time they were sure they only have one choice but they still let us wait in the airport for their delay. I was so tired that I wanted to lay on the floor close to one of the fire exit door to take a nap. But I can not. The customer’s time is not respected!",-1

Jetblue canceled our flight from JFK NY to Rochester NY at 1.30am when the flight was supposed to leave at 10.45pm. No help from gate agents, basically told to figure it out. All hotels within 30 mins booked up. At 2am with a 5 and a 6 year old child we left the safety of the airport at the gate agents suggestion to get a hotel telling us to go to the TWA hotel and get a room and we would be reimbursed for the cost by Jetblue. Fully booked at the TWA Hotel. We were stranded and forced to sleep in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in a hotel lobby as we had no way of getting back into the airport with no flight scheduled at this time and no boarding pass to enter through security to get back into the airport terminal. What a scary and awful experience with my young children and wife. Imagine being a 5 year old child not knowing what is going on and thinking we would never get home and I can only try and comfort them.",-1

It cost the family $900 in rebooking last minute flights through more reliable airlines. This time my flight has been delayed 5 hours, they are blaming customer issues in Orlando. If they cancel this flight it will cost me hundreds of dollars to rebook flights and rebooking fees. Save your money and travel with anyone else.",-1
2022-03-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Aguadilla to Portland via New York,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,1,never be flying with this airline again,True,"  I want to start by saying the airline crew was pleasant the entire time and I give them 11/10. However, jet blue as a whole -10 stars. It was issue after issue the entire time from start to finish. Cancellation, delays, then lost luggage on the way home. We were lied to at every turn about our luggage being lost because it was an ""international flight"". This flight was a domestic flight! We had to buy all new things, stranded in Portland with nothing, not even the keys to my car. We had to get a new set of keys made which cost about 200 bucks, among other hygiene products. They are only offering 62 dollars reimbursement. What a joke! When we finally got our luggage delivered to our house the worker that delivered let us know he was a baggage manager and to never check a bag with Jet Blue. I will never be flying with this airline again, and I will never recommend them to anyone. We fly about 6 times a year, sometimes just my husband and I but mostly with our entire family of 16.",-1

No information was offered to the delay, or any updates for that matter. Using an app I saw that our delayed flight was being flown in from Providence RI. The plane landed and passengers disembarked, still no information. We sat at the gate until 2am, when the flight was finally removed from the departures board. Yet still no information or even an announcement that it was cancelled. Went to talk to the desk representative and I was abruptly told he would provide information when he had it. I told him to get a supervisor. Many others were voicing their concerns as well, the counter person must have felt ""threatened"" because the police were called on passengers that had be waiting for 8 hours and continually lied to, so JetBlue's answer to simple passenger questions is to call the police, how very fascist of a supposedly enlightened airline. After the cancellation we were informed that it was weather, then air traffic control and finally that the crew from Providence timed-out. Unbelievably poor customer service. Time to fly another airline.",-1

Our original departure time was 4:25pm from Orlando, FL, but we didn’t take off till the next day at 7:30AM heading to JFK. With zero customer service and lies, and lies, and more lies!! “We’re waiting on a new crew, we’re waiting on a flight back from NY, oh staffing issues, oh we’re waiting on a flight from Punta Cana, there’s a pilot heading to the airport now” and the lies never stopped coming.  I had small children and a mother in a wheelchair and that did not matter to JetBlue.

Both of our flights were delayed 2 hours due to plane issues or lack of pilots. TVs didn’t work. Took forever to get luggage. Many many around me were complaining they had the same issues recently. I will look to avoid JetBlue in the future and I was a frequent flyer.,-1

No more! Their service has gone downhill all the way with constant delays and poor communication with passengers. Last Friday’s flight was delayed so many times Jetblue issued an apology with a follow up service credit of $50 - as IF that would cover everyone’s frustration with no reason given for all the delays. Then in my return flight home on Sunday another 5 delays where we were then told pilots hadn’t yet arrived but were due to arrive around 8:30 from a Vegas flight they were flying - really? Were these the same pilots that were supposed to be flying our original 6:30 flight? We ended up departing at 9:30 PM - totally unacceptable. I will be writing a letter as well as leaving negative comments everywhere. My opinion - they are short staffed and booking flights with no intention of being on time.,-1

My flight was canceled due to a snow storm. That's fine. When I received the email directing me to my flight credit to re-book my flight - the account displayed 0 credits.

2022-03-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Providenciales,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,They need better customer service,False,"  I purchased a blue basic fare from EWR to PLS. After being delayed by 2 hours and having to switch gates 2-3 times, I ended up being late to pick up my car rental which caused me to have to collect the following day due to the rental counter being closed. I also had an issue with my airbnb check in due to being late. I informed JetBlue and requested to move my ticket by a day so I could try to play catch-up as the following day I spent half the day trying to resolve the car rental and airbnb issue all caused from a 2 hr delay. I spoke with 3 representatives including one claiming to be a supervisor, I requested to speak to another supervisor and was told she would reach out and speak to them directly and that they gave the same response, they would not switch the ticket without me paying a $100 change fee and difference in airfare. The difference in airfare wasn’t the issue the change fee was. I was also informed the flight took off at 2.10 pm when I’m fact my screenshot shows it took off at 2.40pm. Not sure why JetBlue would lie about that. The following day I receive an email from JetBlue stating that as a loyal Mosaic member I’m entitled to switch the ticket without any fees or difference in air fare as long as it’s within 24 hours of the flight. The reps I spoke to all failed to mention that. I called back and spoke with a rep who stated that he wasn’t sure why they didn’t tell me that as he would tell me. I provided my flight info and was told he couldn’t do anything. When I asked to speak with a supervisor to see what could be done he left me on hold for 15 mins. I’m still disputing this with JetBlue. They’re consistently late, I once was delayed for 8 hours and switched aircraft twice. The plane I also boarded I paid for an even more space seat which was dirty had crumbs on it and some unidentified substance splashed on the cabin wall. Not sure what’s going on with that as the aircraft is to be disinfected between flights especially during covid. They need better customer service, learn to stop being delayed often and to clean their aircraft better.",-1

Jetblue needs to revise this ticket category. For now, I will not fly with Jetblue.",-1

Received word early on that there was a flight delay. Every 2 hours or so I received notification about another delay. The okane was to take off at 445 PM. The last notification was that it would be 1AM. When asking about changing flights we were told that was not allowed and when we wanted a refund, were told the flight was not cancelled so that was not an option. We were told they ""ran out of vouchers"" to the lounge and were treated very rudely by the agent. Transparency in why flights are delayed would go over better than not. I was told by many how great the customer service was and I saw none of that. I was told that if we qualified we would automatically be sent compensation- the flight should be comped as well as food for the many hours spent. I will never fly JetBlue again.",-1
2022-03-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Raleigh,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,has the worst customer service,False,  I left my wallet on plane. Contacted everyone that I could and even reached out to the airport the plane was going to. When I realized I went to tell JetBlue help desk and was told the plane left and was already on its way back to Boston but they told me the plane was at gate c10 and I still saw the plane sitting there. So I reached out to Boston where the plane was due to fly next and told them what was going on. They told me that once the plane landed they would recover it an give me a call. They never called which makes me think they never even looked. I now have no id and no way to return home. They needed to take less than 2 mins to just walk to my seat and grab it where I left it and they could not even do that. JetBlue has the worst customer service and lost and found program. If you ever lose something on one of there flights consider it gone for good.,-1
2022-03-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Cartagena,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,we are fighting for our money back,True,  I was supposed to leave JFK at 921am on feb 27 2022. I received a delayed email fairly early that the flight was leaving at 1104 am in which it did. On 3/9/22 we were suppose to depart at 230pm. We were boarded then unboarded do to plane maintenance. The flight was delayed to 410pm then 5pm then 7pm. Jetblue employees have no explanation other then maintenance. This is the second time a flight was delayed this long. First time on my flight in Puerto Rico in April. They vowed the flight will not be cancelled and the next announcement was the cancellation of our flight. Jetblue employees said we would be refunded in full for our expenses do to the fact that there hotel of choice was booked. Till this day we are fighting for our money back.,-1
2022-03-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Liberia to Charleston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Expect delayed and canceled flights,False,"  I usually don't waste my time writing reviews but if this will help in supporting the rest of the many negative comments Ive read so far about their lack of customer service and poor quality in general, than it is worth it. Expect delayed and canceled flights and then to spend endless hours on hold if you are patient enough to try and recuperate some of the money you will lose in buying new flights, connecting flights, renting cars, ubers etc trying to reach your destination. I was actually given a fake confirmation number in regards to a refund they were supposed to issue back onto my card; when i called a month later current employee I spoke to (after another 1.5 hours of my life wasted) was that there was nothing he could do because supposedly they don't even give out confirmation numbers for refunds. I will never fly with Jetblue again and I would advise anyone to do the same. If you think you're going to save money because their ticket is cheaper than other airlines, it's likely that you will spend even more money trying to save your trip by buying and piecing together new flights to make up for their mistakes.",-1
2022-03-08,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Cleveland,3.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,worst travel experience of my life,False,"  This was the worst travel experience of my life. Cancelled flights, rude/disrespectful employees who were unwilling to assist with anything. I provided a 2/10 rating simply because I made it to my destination(s) finally. We started off with a cancelled flight within 15 hours of our departure for a family cruise. Luckily we were traveling with 1 day to spare but because we reserved through Expedia JetBlue would not help - whether this is their responsibility or not they were the one who cancelled the flight which threw the whole trip into a tailspin. Once rerouted on a sister flight with American I had to repay all baggage and extra seat fees. Charges were still on my credit card for the JetBlue fees. We arrived 14 hours after our anticipated arrival but made it. The return flight home was a mess start to finish as well with 2 members of our party having to rent a car at an additional $1000 charge to drive 19 hours home d/t JetBlue/Travelocity issues with their confirmation - even though tickets were purchased 3 months prior. Every arrow points to the original flight cancellation and the lack of concerns in making sure the return flight would still be ok with all the changes made in the original flights. Customer service agent in FLL at the kiosk with disrespectful behavior towards customers such as eye rolling, acting as if they were doing us a favor - I spent my money on their tickets not the other way around? Just ridiculous that a company can make money and stay afloat treating customers in such a poor manner. I won't fly JetBlue again and I would recommend others consider their options before placing any trust in this airline to get you where you need to go in a timely fashion or expectation that you will be treated with the common respect that everyone deserves. Eye rolling to me is not something anyone should have to put up with when they just want the situation resolved. The next treat is that I still have the charges (not pending but charged) on my credit card from JetBlue today for the extras I paid for but did not receive. When calling customer service the wait time is 1 hour - my credit card company can deal with that for me at least.",-1
2022-03-08,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Albuquerque,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3,not want to give refund for transportation,True,  Yesterday the flight was cancelled and no reason was given. I spent $160 to go home and had to rebook my limo $150. Call airline and was told the reason was weather (weather was okay) but I guess they do not want to give refund for transportation expenses. I was charged for my luggage three time time and customer agents at the airport were rude.,-1
2022-03-07,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Boston to Florida,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,They are absolutely the worst,True, They are absolutely the worst. I can’t remember the last time that I had 2 flights in a row without major delays. We flew from Boston to Fort Myers Florida and back. They were 3.5 hours late to Florida and we had no idea of delay til about 10 minutes before boarding. The way back to Boston was better. We were only 2.5 hours late but this time they let us know. They started letting us know hours before the flight this time but we didn’t know how long. We left over 2hrs late then had to wait on tarmac for about 20 minutes. They used to always use covid as an excuse and I accepted it but they can’t use that excuse now. They just do not care.,-1
2022-03-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Orlando via Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The most horrible experience,True,"  I paid my ticket at 3:30pm for the same day flight which should be at 11:50pm. The flight got delayed 1 hour. Jetblue changed my connection in Boston from 7:21am to 3:50pm and sent me an itinerary that reflected an extra charge of over $800.00 dollars. I had to spend 4 hours waiting for a CS representative who told me I would not be charged extra money for this change but at the end gave me no option of an earlier flight. I lost an important meeting in Orlando, Fl and got not even a courtesy voucher for the 8 hours delay and the one hour from Phoenix to Boston. On top of this, I received 15 emails showing my flight on time. The most horrible experience I have ever had in my entire flight history. I will never use this airline again.",-1
2022-03-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to New York,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,3,fix your website,False," Miami to New York. What happened to JB customer service? First, the Mint representative was very rude in NY airport when I tried to check in. Today we spent an hour trying to book another flight on JB website. The sessions timed out 3 times. Had to start over and now we are not even sure it got booked. Now I am supposed to wait for an hour trying to get ahold of them to make sure our flight did get booked! They offer to text you instead of waiting on the phone. The texting app is useless. It obviously a robot that is zero help. How about offering a call back instead of making people wait for hours or offering texts? And fix your website! I always book on Kayak without any issues. Waste of time!",-1
2022-03-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,got zero help whatsoever with them,True,"  Flight from LAX to ATX was delayed but took off. Flight from ATX to LAX got canceled just a few hours before the flight. Not reason given. I spent hours and hours on wait. Their webpage is useless as they do not have the information. They have the link and the titles but the information is not there or very bogus. When I finally got connected they wanted to offer a re-schedule to the ""NEXT"" available flight 5 days later to NYC and then to LAX. They explained that if I didn't want to take this option they could review my case and they would let me know in 7 days if I qualify for a reimbursement. Not Once they could answer what was the reason for the flight to be cancelled. I had the option to spend $$$ on a flight home that day (Which I did for $600 dollars, bc last minute flight) or spend $$$ on hotel for 5 days (5 X $300, plus meals, plus transportation, plus my car parked in LAX, plus my child's sitter) The whole thing was so ridiculous. I would have been better off getting a better class with another airline from the get go than trying to spare some money and having to spend it anyway and being super stressed about it. I got zero help whatsoever with them. If you get cancellation from them, do not waste your time, they would not solve anything for the life of them.",-1
2022-03-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to La Guardia,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,Now they are the absolute worst,False,"  Worst experience that has cost more than $300 due to their incompetency, not including the major impact on my plans and reason for my trip which was a very important doctors appointment. My flight to Westchester was cancelled and they sent me an email 4hrs prior however I’m 65 years old and don’t check my email several times a day. They called me as I was leaving for the airport 2 hrs prior to flight. They took it upon themselves to accommodate me another flight the next day and arriving at a different airport over two hours away from my destination. Spent over 6hrs trying to resolve this on the phone with them, after talking to multiple people and waiting for hrs at a time they had to transfer me to a Supervision and after I waited for an extra 90 minutes the Supervisor answered and hung up the phone on me. Now I had to make arrangements for pick up and pay $150 for a ride on a different day, I had paid for a checked bag and at that point I needed to just bring a carry on and hope and pray I would have time to still make it straight to my drs appointment. I was at the airport and greeted by the rudest attendant who refused to acknowledge what I was going through and unwilling to allow me to just have my carry on after all they had put me through and I had already paid for a bag. She charged me an additional $75 dollars to upgrade my ticket just so I could bring my carry on and I was still the last passenger on the plane. just to bring my carry on ended up costing me $100. There’s a reason they are considered the worst airline, JetBlue used to be good. Now they are the absolute worst. Disgusting the way they treat their costumers, constant delays, and impossible to get assistance over the phone. They are always delayed but this was just beyond. Please I urge you to choose a different airline before ever considering choosing an unreliable airline with terrible costumer service like JetBlue. I’m hurt and saddened by the way I was treated. Extremely disappointed.",-1
2022-02-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Fort Lauderdale to Westchester County,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,Always late late late,True," Always late late late. My sister flies this route every week. Delayed over 2 hours 5 out of 6 times. I’m sitting at the gate. JetBlue Ft Lauderdale to Westchester, LaGuardia and Newark all delayed. Fly American, always on time.",-1
2022-02-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Sarasota,1.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,What a horrible airline,False,"  This airline treats disabled people like luggage. I set out at 9 am for EWR. Then got a call that the flight was changed to LGA. So we turned around, crossed bridges, paid tolls. When we were 20 minutes from LGA they changed it back to Newark - for Tampa. My car is at Sarasota. Got to LGA and port authority offered a wheelchair and assistance finding a JetBlue “manager”. I think this was some girl loading luggage who told me there are not enough pilots so all flights to Sarasota are cancelled. She refused to help me with ground transportation from Tampa to Sarasota so I could get my car. She refused to book me on another airline. When I pressed for further assistance she walked away. Well it’s obvious. She deals with luggage. So my son struggled to wheel me with my carry-on to another counter where I could buy a ticket at a likely inflated price from a real airline. Port authority again to the rescues. This time they got a manager who seemed to be a manager. He offered a choice of flights to Tampa and assured me that JetBlue would arrange ground transportation to Sarasota for me to get my car. So now I am at the gate and there aren’t enough planes so I have to wait another 5 hours. Meantime I need to get assistance with bathroom and getting something to eat. It’s humiliating and exhausting. And if there really is transportation at Tampa at 1am I will be driving home in the dark which I had attempted to avoid. Not enough pilots. Not enough planes. What a horrible airline. With this much unavailability it’s like flying standby - but I’m a paying disabled customer. They are headquartered in NY. They know that making people go round in circles between airports on short notice is wrong. Not enough pilots. Not enough planes. No consideration for disabled. It’s like I’m freight. I wonder how many days it will take to get home. I intend to request my money back.",-1

A hour flight turned into 3.5 hours. Plane not cleaned or sanitized. Jet Blue is disgusting and I will never fly with them again.",-1
2022-02-24,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Albany,,,,,,,1,last attempt has me really frustrated,False,"  I have traveled with JetBlue Airways since they opened and have always loved the service, until recently! Flights have been delayed almost every time we travel now and I don't mean just a few minutes, it's been hours. But that is not my complaint today, I realize things happen that are out of their control and they are providing us with the safest route. My complaint today is when COVID first hit we had a trip to Cooperstown booked and of course was unable to go. At the time I was so happy with JetBlue because they offered what they called a Travel Bank. This allowed us to bank our money in a JetBlue acct and use it in the future, with an expiration date of course, which is fair. My expiration date has been extended but is still coming close to expiring. Since that time we have tried traveling to Panama City, Houston and now Phoenix all being unsuccessful with the travel bank money. This last attempt to Phoenix has me really frustrated. I went to JetBlue.com found the perfect flight got clear to the end to pay and there was no option to use my travel bank money. So I called 1-800-JetBlue, Waited on hold for 35 minutes, not bad, right? Well I got someone who spoke very broken English and I could not understand what they were trying to say. So I asked to talk to their supervisor. Guess how long this hold time was, 1 hr and 48 min. No joke! When the supervisor answered I explained my situation. She had no comment. I asked if she could help me book the flight and she told me it would be $25/per person. Well at this point I was so frustrated I agreed to the extra $75. She proceeds and gets to the final payment and responds to me with this is not a JetBlue flight. What?! It's on JetBlue.com? She said it is a dba JSX whatever that means. I explain once again that I am frustrated with not only my hold time but also with how difficult this has been to use the Travel Bank money. Silence, she could care less. I say, so you are telling me I can't use this money and she response yes thank you for calling JetBlue. Looks like I will be finding a new favorite airline!",-1
2022-02-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will not trust them again,False,"  The morning of our flight to Orlando we received an email stating our flight was canceled. This was at 7:30 am for a 3:00 pm flight. The automated phone call to tell us the flight was canceled came at 10:30 am, 3 hours after the email. We did see the email and tried to call Jetblue to reschedule as per the instructions from the email. After over 2 hours on hold we were told there were no options to reschedule and we would get a refund. That's nice that the airline will refund a few hundred dollars but what about the car rental, hotel, and Disney World tickets? While we were on hold waiting for a Jetblue agent we scheduled a flight with Delta that gets us to Orlando tomorrow morning (paid extra for the option to cancel as we were still waiting to see what Jetblue could do). We ended up paying about $600 more but hey at least we still get to Orland to celebrate my wife's birthday. I decided to google Jetblue and found that they rank last of the major US airlines. I wish I knew that before I trusted them to get me to Orlando. I will not trust them again.",-1
2022-02-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bradley to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly Jetblue again,False,"  Jetblue has terrible maintenance, this is the second time that i have been delayed 6+ hours waiting on plane maintenance.  I have been waiting to board since 8:49 am, it is now 12pm. And was just informed we are waiting on a part to be delivered from JFK Airport and hope to board by 2:30pm, this is absolute nonsense. They cannot even find another plane or sister company to get us to the destination in a timely manner so offering a refund for the flight is laughable. I have wasted a work day and a vacation day being held hostage by an incompetent airline. I will never fly Jetblue again. The last time this happened to me I gave them the benefit of the doubt. A 6pm flight from Texas to my home was delayed until 3 am until they broke and booked us a room at a nearby hotel only to return to the airport for a 7 am flight. I got zero sleep. Missed my connecting flight and it ruined the end of my trip.",-1

I fly every other week for work and have never enjoyed the travel so much. The crew were amazing. It was my birthday and they treated me like an absolute queen with constant care. Unfortunately my travel mate became sick on the flight but I have never seen stewardesses do so much and care so much. The aircraft was clean and spacious, great snack, great entertainment.  I wish I could give a shout out by name to all that played a part.",1
2022-02-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,New York to Fort Myers,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,poor staffing everywhere else,True,"  What happened to JetBlue!? JetBlue used to be the best way to fly. Never again! I checked in the night before and paid for my bag. When I arrived to the terminal, the self check in kiosk would not print my bag tag. No one would help. They put me in a line- with people with the same problem. There were 8 available computers but only 5 people to assist. Of those 5, only 1 was actually helping. They seemed more concerned about taking a break. When the manager was confronted, he only rolled his eyes and shook his head. We waited over an hour just to get a bag tag. They caused the entire line to get frustrated because their lack of work. Finally got done and through security. I went to the gate. I didn’t have a seat assigned. They assigned me 25C. I had maybe ten minutes so I used the restroom. When I returned, the same lady said I wasn’t on that flight - after she assigned my seat. She then said “I changed your seat”. 25A. Not a big deal. I walked to the last row on the plane and someone was in my seat. The flight attendant gave an attitude about the situation. Four people had to be moved against what their tickets said. When the lady from the gate came on the plane to confirm, she accused me of lying and changing my seat even though I showed her the boarding pass she gave me. She accused another young lady of lying. Finally took off. TV didn’t work, gum was stuck to the wall between the chair. The flight attendant still gave us in the back attitude because of the seat issue that wasn’t our fault. She then stood in the back work area and complained to another attendant about how bad it is to work for JetBlue. Not the best representation of your airline. Terrible experience. I fly 40-45 weeks out of the year and while there are always issues to arise, this was by far the worst. Bye JetBlue. I will never fly with you again. Overall rating of 1 of 10 only because we actually made our destination. This ordeal wasn’t the Pilot’s fault. Just poor staffing everywhere else.",-1

Nearly every single person was rude and snappy. They were extremely slow with the service. My flight was cancelled due to weather and not rescheduled until 14 hours later! No accommodations were offered at all. Then, my flight wasn’t able to be found online, within the boards in the airport, nor was I able to check-in. It took 45 minutes to get help at the help desk in terminal 5, while there were 2-5 employees behind the desk at all times and only 7 people in front of me. This was the absolutely worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Spirit has better customer service. Super disappointed!",-1
2022-02-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Cancun to Sacramento,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,experienced the worst stewardess,True,"  Just got off my flight tonight with JetBlue airlines and my wife and I just experienced the worst stewardess we have encountered on any flight with any airlines. This woman needs to be removed and retrained on professionalism. All I asked for were 2 of each complimentary snacks (1 set for me, 1 set for my wife) instead she hands me 1 set and walks away. I inquire about the second set and was met with a rude “I will give it to you later!” and walks away. My wife and I were forced to share one set of snacks between the both of us. I waited for her to come back after serving everyone else and as I said “excuse me” she abruptly throws the second set of snacks on the empty seat next to me with scowl and walks away without a single word, even after I said thank you. Even as I left the the plane she was scowling at me and refused to say thank you to me or my wife but heard her say thank you to others before and after us.  On top of that we spent extra to be in the extra comfort seats. Normally stewardess try to be more hospitable to your highest paying customers but we were met with the exact opposite. This was our first time flying with them internationally and we will not be returning. Thanks for ruining the end of our Valentine’s Day.",-1

When doing the checkin at JetBlue front desk at Orlando MCO airport, It was discovered that Chase never completed the booking and I wasn’t booked for the flight. Diane at the JetBlue airport front desk at 5am, kept me calm and did some magic to get me into the plane. Thanks to her I did not lose the flight to see my family - that’s the type of person and leader you need and want in an organization. You don’t need a big title to be a leader.",1
2022-02-14,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Austin,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5,"Jetblue, please step it up",True,"  JetBlue is a great airline. I flew from Newark to Austin and back after a few days. Service was great, the seats were comfortable, food and beverages were good. The major downside was the IFE system that I encountered on both flights. On the flight from Newark, the A320's new screens were not even working and off the whole time and even the power was not working as I needed to charge my phone. For a 4 hour flight, not having IFE and power working was disappointing. On my return flight, unlucky for me, the seat I was sitting in did not respond and was stuck on the ""welcome on board"" screen the entire flight. At least the power outlets were working on this flight. I am very disappointed on JetBlue's inability to make sure their screens are working on these refurbished A320's. I can't speak for the A321, as it been years since I flew on that aircraft. I have to say the E190's old screens are working fine than these A320's screens. Maybe I was unlucky these two times. But Jetblue, please step it up in this category. Passengers deserve entertainment on these 3+hour flights. Everything else, good job.",1
2022-02-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Washington,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,I’m reminded why I don’t fly JetBlue anymore,True," I used to fly JetBlue religiously but in the past five years the service has gone downhill fast. They’ve made significant changes to how they board and manage luggage to charge for every possible option, choosing a seat, when you board, even charging for carry-on luggage which brings the quality of this airline down to budget airlines like Spirit while Airlines I used to consider comparable in quality like Delta are now worlds better. JetBlue used to be a unique carrier that didn’t nickel and dime you but I’ve since stopped flying JetBlue and am happy to pay a little more for a worlds better experience through Delta. Booked this one flight to travel with a family member and I’m reminded why I don’t fly JetBlue anymore. Flight was 1/3 full yet I wasn’t allowed to carry-on luggage without paying for an extra space seat at 61 dollar upcharge, and forced to pay 35 for checking a tiny suitcase when the entire plane was empty! Clearly have no regard for the customer experience anymore. What a shame, I’ll stick to Delta from now on.",-1

I was boarded on AA elite group seat 8B flight 1766, middle seat. During the flight the TV's were broken at several seats. A few rows behind me there were several seats available with no one sitting in the entire rows. I asked if I could change seats due to being in the middle seat and the TV was not working, stewardess stated that I didn’t not pay for that seat and I could not move, several others asked if they could move as well due to the TV issues and she would not let anyone move seat. She said she could give a $15 voucher due to the TV being broken. I fly multiple times a week on different airlines. I have never seen anyone so rude as to you cannot move your seat. Entire rows were empty and she would not let anyone move. Not your finest employee, I will run all my business through Delta going forward.",-1
2022-02-08,0.3,Business,Business Class,London to new York JFK,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3,rude and aggressive cabin crew,False," Mint (business eqv) is supposedly their premium product on long haul flights. Remembering that this is a narrow body jet the configuration is tight. The seat is very narrow and would be uncomfortable for someone with a fuller figure. Food is OK but nothing special. The worst aspect of this airline is unfortunately their rude and aggressive cabin crew, customer service and consideration just does not feature. When asking for more champagne I was told ""it's run out - you get what you pay for"". They also police mask wearing with a nonsensical zealotry that many found oppressive, intrusive and unnecessary. I have not experienced this approach on any other airline as they seem to revel in telling what you cannot do. The cost of UK£3500 is not cheap for J class and when you factor in no lounges and really horrible to non-existent service, it is very overpriced. I have read many comments regarding the awful attitude of their cabin crew and wonder why management have not addressed this. Needless to say I nor anyone in my business will be flying with this company ever again.",-1

I had a flight booked from Dallas to Boston via (New York) and due to severe weather conditions it got canceled, so they booked me for the flight the next day, but they only did it for the flight from Dallas to New York, not the one from New York to Boston which is absurd. When I tried asking them to book me for a flight from New York to Boston, and they were unable to, I asked for cancelation and a refund which took me 5 hours. The worst service, hands down!",-1
2022-02-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami via Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"employee was really rude, sarcastic",True,"  I had a connection in Miami with JetBlue this last Sunday ,and it was a really nightmare! I came from São Paulo (LATAM) and I arrived at Miami airport at 5:30am, my flight with JetBlue was at 8:00am , the point is the system falls and all passengers and I stayed stuck for 2 hours at the customs service. So I leaved customs service almost 7:30 and I run because my flight was at 8:00 with JetBlue. The employees said me that i just needed to leave my bag with the JetBlue employees (service desk) and run because it was a connection. So at this time my nightmare started, first the JetBlue employee was really rude, sarcastic, horrible person. I explained to her that I just needed to leave my luggage because I had connection, and I explained too about the customs service situation, so even after this she didn't help me. She made me come back to the line, wait,wasted my time and when finally arrived my time for she take care of my luggage she took long, you know when someone really doesn't want to work or help? Yes ,it was exactly what happened there! And when I was in line waiting for she take care of my luggage (before 8:00am) arrived one family and she took their luggages straight, without make them stay on line and during the time that supposedly she needs to take care of my situation she stopped many times to take care of other passengers! So I stayed there waiting for she finished when she said to me ""sorry you lose your flight"" This was horrible, the sarcasm in her face. I asked her for please help me, and she did nothing!  This was at 8:00, so I need to come and go desperate many times and for hours for she say me that she ""could"" give me one ticket for next day.  How I could stay all day and night on the airport and she said again ""is not my business"", she said that for me many times and laughing with the others attendants. My husband bought other ticket (with Delta airlines) and we need to spend almost $1000, this super expensive price because your attendant doesn't want to help me any moment.",-1
2022-02-01,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Boston,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,never been so upset with an airline,False," I have been flying with JetBlue for years and when I was younger, I used to get the best service. Since 5 years ago, they have been seriously struggling. I am continuously let down by this airline. Being a TrueBlue member, I used to appreciate the 1 free bag check, 10/10 services and complimentary items. I have not received this treatment in years. I had a flight scheduled for 7 am on Sunday, Jan 30. It was cancelled due to the snow storm, which I understand. I rescheduled for 3:45 on that same Sunday. Around 1 pm, the flight began delays. Every hour it would be delayed from 3:45 pm to 4:15 pm to 5:30 pm to 6:45 pm to 7:15 pm to 10:39 pm to 11:06 pm to 4:39 am. Finally, the flight got changed from 4:39 am to 1:54 am. I was glad to be back before my nursing classes at 8:30 am. I was on my way to the airport when I got 2 emails ... 1 saying the delay was back to 4:39 am and one saying 4:00 pm. I was confused. I scheduled an uber at 2 am and when I arrived at the airport and tried getting my ticket, it wouldn't load. A cop came up to me and explained the flight (that was delayed over 10x) was cancelled. I understand things happen, but if there was even a thought that it would be delayed over 24 hours, reschedule it. They made tens on hundreds of passengers wait in the airport for 12+ hours, not including the wait time to get hotels, different flights, etc. I have never been so upset with an airline. Today (Monday, Jan 31), I arrived at the airport for 2 pm for my 4 pm flight and they delayed it again on 7 pm. We have still not boarded and it is almost 6:45 pm. The chances of us leaving at 7 pm are slim and they still haven't even boarded yet. I understand difficulties happen, but the first excuse was the weather, second excuse was that the crew members needed sleep and the third excuse was that a crew member was late. The first excuse occurred between 1 pm and 11 pm. The second excuse occurred between 1:30 am and creating a cancellation and reschedule for Monday, Jan 31 at 4 pm. It was again delayed due to a crew member not showing up. Finally boarded at 7:15 pm and in air by 7:35 pm.",-1

I had the worst experience of my life with them. They cancelled our flight home while we were on the connecting flight. We waited in line for 4 hours to talk to someone only for them to not help us at all. They were rude and unprofessional and gave us no real solutions. They offered us a different flight two days after we were supposed to be home. After an additional 12 hours of trying to talk to someone on the phone or chat, they offered us a $100 travel credit as if that makes up for us being stranded for 2 days at the airport.",-1

No customer service. We arrive the next day for the re-scheduled flight and they cancelled that one too. They told me I couldn’t go out till the next day. They held our luggage, made everything harder than it had to be. I haven’t had this bad of a travel experience in all my years. This was not a weather related issue, because every other carrier came and left. They lie all day and make you sit there only to be told there’s a dead end hours later with hungry, tired children. Now they tell me no compensation because it was weather related? I have never seen such horrific behavior towards paying loyal customers. I will Be taking my business elsewhere.",-1
2022-01-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to New York,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2,my first surprise was $70 in luggage fees,True,"  I remember the time when Jetblue would hands down beat any other airline at prices and quality of service. So was a large surprise that on the latest trip my expectations were turned upside down. My round-trip ticket from NYC to Denver consisted of two separate flights. United on the way there and Jetblue coming back. The first unexpected experience was United. It turns out that even in the cheapest class, they do not charge for checked-in sports equipment. It's free. The plane was also new. The service was professional and courteous. Everything went as it should. Something I would not necessarily expect from United (at least a few years back). Jetblue on the other hand historically has a reputation for reasonable fees and a good level of service. So my first surprise was $70 in luggage fees, the same exact luggage that United took in for free. On JetBlue overnight flight we only had around 3 hours to get a little bit of sleep. So, with this in mind, I asked for a glass of water when boarding the plane. I was thirsty. And didn't want to wait till after takeoff. Surprisingly, my request was denied. So once the seat belt sign went off, I asked again. And was again told to wait. For water! Until cabin service starts (already 40 minutes into the flight). In another 15 minutes, they did start the service. And about an hour after boarding this plane and initially asking for a glass of water I was able to get it. With now only 2 hours remaining for the precious sleep. I mentioned my complaint to a flight attendant. On my comment that I shouldn't have to wait for an hour for water, he arrogantly told me that that's the way things are in their airline and he does not actually see any problem. Yep, that's the way things are. Perhaps Jetblue and United have swapped places.",-1
2022-01-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to San José,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,I’ll never fly with JetBlue again,False," We flew down to Costa Rica on Jet blue and right from the get go their customer service was terrible. They ask you to be at the airport 3 hours before your flight. Well their ticketing agents and bag checkers didn’t show up until 1.5 hours before the flight so we sat in their line with other customers after arriving at the airport at 3am, flight was at 6. Then on the way home they canceled our flight the night before after we have already gotten Covid tests, booked our transportation to the airport etc. They claim weather was to blame but the forecast shows our destination as weather free just cold, they canceled a flight from Costa Rica to south Florida due to winter weather in the north east what a joke. Other airlines are still making the same flight. I’d wager this has more to do with a labor issue. When trying to contact their customer service good Luck, we have been waiting for 12 hours to talk to someone. I’ll never fly with JetBlue again, I’d recommend you save yourself the headache and just buy a slightly more expensive ticket with a major airline it will end up being cheaper and save you a headache.",-1
2022-01-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Juan,,,,1.0,,,1,told it was not a credit,False," Could not get a refund and told it would be a credit.  Took 3 days for someone to find my credit, told it was not a credit and could not use it to book my flight and my daughters since it was not a credit. Told they would charge me $150.00 to use my non-credit to book a flight and i had to pay for my daughters flight separately and if any thing was left over from my non credit I would get a credit. Told they were helping me by adding on things to my not credit by giving me credit. Thanks Jet Blue, why do i feel like they think a fool and his money are soon departed?",-1
2022-01-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,booking with JetBlue like buying a lottery ticket,False," JetBlue's customer service is embarrassingly terrible. My 5:30pm departure flight had to be cancelled due to a snowstorm and rebooked in January 2022. The problem: JetBlue's automated system immediately rebooked my departure to 1:30pm and informed me about my new flight at 1:44pm. In other words, I was informed about my new departure time 14 minutes after the flight departed (Never mind the fact I wasn't anywhere close to the airport because my flight was at 5:30pm). I ended up booking a train back to avoid dealing with JetBlue's disorganization (to add insult to injury: weather events are common problems for airlines so I'd imagine JetBlue would have figured out how to deal with this issue by now). After this mess I had to call JetBlue three or four times to get ahold of a representative. After waiting on the phone for a total of five hours (not an exaggeration) I was finally given a travel credit that must be used within a year (my request to get my money back was transferred to a supervisor who never picked up--surprise). I'm sure this solution works for JetBlue because it will get to pocket my money when I fail to use it in a year (or inevitably forget to extend the credit before the end of the year). Overall, consider booking with JetBlue like buying a lottery ticket: you might get lucky and get where you're going or JetBlue might get lucky and get to pocket your hard-earned vacation money. It's a fair bet, right?",-1
2022-01-25,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Boston,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1,I now rank the airline in the Spirit category,False,"  Attempted to fly with Jetblue over the Christmas break 2021. Jetblue then ""rebooked"" me on two separate occasions delaying my departure by nearly 48 hours. This caused me to lose my non-refundable hotel reservations because I would have arrived the day of check-out. Jetblue refunded the flight but refuses to refund the lost hotel cost. They stated because I was not on the flight, this cannot be reimbursed. So you delay me 48 hours, cause me to miss a reservation, but I could have traveled to Boston booked a second night and you would have reimbursed the first night lost? Seems like a nice loophole to get out of reimbursement for damages. I've flown Jetblue a number of times previously but the airline has significantly declined recently with their long call wait times, poor quality of online help chat, and poor service performance, I now rank the airline in the Spirit category for reliability and service.",-1
2022-01-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to port of Spain via Ft Lauderdale,,,,,,,1,Essentially I was robbed of $460 USD,True,"  Booked a flight for March and got an email today saying that ""We have made some changes to our schedule that will result in you missing your connecting flight"". Instead of a 2.5 hour layover it got cut to a 50 minute layover. Since the first flight was not changed by over 2 hours, I was not eligible for a full refund to my original payment method. Instead, I got a refund in the form of Travel Bank credits, which I can only use with JetBlue and expire after a year. I am not planning any travel for a long while, so there is a good chance that I will not be able to use the credits before they expire, and I don't appreciate being forced to use JetBlue. Essentially I was robbed of $460 USD.",-1

Okay not too big of a deal so I accepted the new changes. The day of said flight was more issues, after boarding the plane had issues so everyone was asked to de-board the plane, flight was delayed and within a few hours I received 4 different alerts as to new itinerary. Long story short my nephew was stranded at the Airport from 8am until almost 5pm in ATL before being put on a flight to JFK with his flight leaving around 10ish, not to mention his bags were put on separate flights meaning he had to still wait at the airport once he arrived for his bags to arrive later.

2022-01-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montego Bay to New York JFK,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,thrown off the plane,True,"  After completing multiple security checks, we board the plane. I am taken aside for ""random"" screening where I am essentially strip searched. I am told by the strip searcher that this has nothing to with Jamaica security and ordered by the airline. After the delay I come aboard the plane and tell the flight attendant that your airline has some nerve. Harassing a trusted traveler (or frankly anyone) with a strip search. I was quite angry and was told to sit down and shut up (not literally) or I will be removed from the plane. I sit down very angry talking with the wife. The attendant then goes to get her supervisor who I to throw me off the plane and remove my bag. The pilot was very approving as well.  I was thrown off the plane and told to take a flight many hours later (somehow I would not be a terrible threat to another crew from the same airline on the same day, go figure!) though my wife was welcome to go and the bag will be sent with her as she needed it as well. Of course that did not happen. The bag was kept at the airport and slow rolled to me so I would have trouble rebooking on a non garbage airline. I was handed an orange ""bad boy warning"" after I was kicked off the plane and humiliated twice in the span of 20 minutes publicly by this excuse of an airline. Of course the warning requirement is by definition supposed to be given before one is kicked off a flight. They make the announcement ""if you don't listen to us we will not (take your money to) let you fly with us. The gate agents were not much better. But then again they also get paid at the end of the week regardless so. Fly anyone else but this airline if you are lucky enough to live in a non monopolistic region",-1

This within itself is ridiculous that you have to pay extra to carry on a bag. Unfortunately I made a mistake and checked my bag however I needed to use my suitcase as a cane walking through the airport because I have chronic back pain. I already paid $35 which is a ridiculous amount for a checked carry-on luggage bag. Staff at the desk Jose West Palm Beach was rude and unwilling to work with me. Your company has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.  They could’ve just switched my ticket which would’ve taken them all in five minutes and allowed me to carry on my back and I could use it through the airport as a cane but instead they forced me to check my bag.

2022-01-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newburgh,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Jet Blue's customer service is horrible,False,"  Delta and United are both on board to extend the travel credits under this unique time in our lives when this Pandemic is hot and cold. However, I have pleaded with Jet Blue to extend another year and they will not under any circumstance. How does Travel + Leisure rate Jet Blue as the number one airline? Are they blind? Jet Blue's customer service is horrible. I have a printed chat from December when I first was pleading with them to please extend. His grammar, spelling, attitude was shockingly bad as I remained the persistent professional senior citizen. Nobody wants my $500 plus credit to fly and I cannot fly due to health reasons. They even eliminated my destination as a place they fly to. Jet Blue is out for profits and not budging an inch on helping it's customers. When a company does this, and word gets out, their business slows down and that is my hope. Good executive management would realize that these times are very unusual and changing past steadfast rules might need to be done in order to survive.",-1

I asked what I could do and offered to even pay right then to be able to board the flight and they said there was nothing they could do and offered to get me to Miami (which is 2+ hours from my destination) a few hours later.

In-flight service was great. I fully understand the circumstances airlines are working under, but the customer service was horrendous, exhausting and down right rude. Flights delayed (multiple times) without explanation (causing many people to miss their connecting flights — I’ve never seen so many people so upset and sprinting after TSA to avoid missing their flight) absurd fees, we were lectured by the help desk as to why we didn’t arrive at the suggested time to prevent us from missing our flight — but we DID. We did everything in our power to make it a seamless process prior to arrival, but the 1.5+ hour wait in the customer service line was the issue. We asked if the TSA line might cause us to miss our flight, their response was “how would I know?” They did absolutely nothing to be helpful and I would say that their poor customer service and endless wait times was the culprit of our exhausting travels. In addition, no more carry-on bags unless you pay a fee? What’s up with that? Continuous issues with their system / app that caused a lot of the problems. jetBlue, we’re asking for transparency and communication. We’re all exhausted, but making it a more effective and seamless process without the confusion would relieve so many issues.",-1
2022-01-17,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to New York JFK,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4,"Very sarcastic, very unfriendly",False," Aside from the horrendous weather which caused a nearly 5-hour delay can leaving florida, the discomfort and discontent was the result of the horrendous attitude and lack of customer care and concern of the crew. I've flown JetBlue for the last 15 or 16 years and usually it's a delight. This particular flight everyone was tired and annoyed by the delays but the staff could care less. Not at all friendly. As an example, I needed to use the bathroom. Went to the back of the plane. Was not familiar with the way to open the compartment. So I needed to ask for help from one attendant who was polite but her other attendant decided to answer me by saying you opened the door by reading where it says open the door. Very sarcastic, very unfriendly. I realize that since I'm 76 it may seem that I'm not savy but it is hurtful when the staff gets some kind of pleasure making a person feel stupid. I really like JetBlue but, they need to train their staff in customer service and not sarcasm and/or law enforcement. Because the other issue with this crew was that all she cared about was making sure people put up their mask, in between every bite or swallow, and she was very autocratic and unpleasant in her mannerisms. Singled folks out and repeatedly came to give them a hard time. Made the whole trip really pretty unpleasant.",1

The flight was delayed from an overpriced 1.46pm flight to a 10.51pm flight after boarding and departing the plane due to a mechanical issue. After waiting for over 5 hours, I got into a line with virtually every other ticket holder and had my flight changed to an 8.30pm flight with American Airlines. Jetblue offered no compensation for being stuck in an airport through no fault of my own for 7 hours. Even when contacted, they believe that changing my flight was sufficient compensation. To that, I say you going out of business would be fair compensation. I'll be charging back my credit card.",-1
2022-01-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardai to Ft Lauderdale,,,,,,,1,I didn't receive a refund,False," Actually, I didn't fly. I was supposed to pick up my grandson in NY on 12/24/2021 and take him for a week of vacation in Florida. December 22, I found out that he was positive for COVID. I made my reservations via Priceline, and I called them. Priceline told me that JetBlue charges $100 per ticket x 2 for my grandson and myself, but they suggested to call the airline direct and maybe they'll wave these $200 because of COVID. I did call JetBlue customer service and a rep told me that I can pay only a $100 and I gave him my credit card, I figure out that a $100 is better than $200. Only after he charged my CC a $100, he said ""Or, by the way you still have to pay $200 when making new reservations"" I asked why he didn't tell me upfront that it's going to be a $100 +$200 and I said that I don't want to deal with JetBlue (JB) and I'll take care through Priceline"" The JB rep said that these $100 will be pending and the refund will be processed, so I won't see a $100 charge. The $100 charge is still on my CC statement and no refund went through. I called today, and after being on hold for 1 hour and 10 min, another rep  made it sound that it was all my fault, that refund was requested, but because a glitch in the system, I didn't receive a refund.

So, we are eager and excited with our first trip ever after the stress on getting tested 24 hours before the trip. With so much excitement then landed in Grand Cayman then lo and behold JetBlue lost our luggage. We filed a report to Jetblue then the saga continues that no customer service available. They put us for hours on hold then the call gets dropped. Yes, they send us the link however it leads you back to call customer service. This is our third day of vacation and still our luggage is nowhere to be seen. Jetblue is worst with with customer service, they have no sympathy with their customer.

2022-01-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Santo Domingo,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Totally disappointed,True," Ft Lauderdale to Santo Domingo. Totally disappointed with the check-in process at Fort Lauderdale airport. Arrived 3 hours ahead for a direct flight to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Every passenger forced to use kiosk to check-in and paid for baggage and obtain baggage print tags. No attendants to put order or assist passengers. Most passengers completely lost with kiosk which caused terrible delays. I have a degree in computer systems and I can tell you that the kiosk interface requires a person to be very technically savvy or prior experience with this device. Even with all my technical savviness and completing the whole process the kiosk charged my credit card for 3 bags but only printed one tag. So I have to chase down an attendant to get info or where to go next and then had to make another long line to go over the whole process again. Of those passengers that successfully got their tags through these kiosks, they all had to do yet another long as line to drop their bags. Having to make two long lines and working for them for free as check-in clerks is not my idea of customer service. No one paying their hard earn cashed should be force to use a kiosk or make two lines to check-in. I can summarize this review as total chaos at Jetblue check-in counter at Fort Lauderdale airport. You could not pay me to go through this process again. Sorry Jetblue but I will not fly with you again.",-1

At Gate I moved to regular chair. JetBlue agent took my assist chair even after I informed him that I was using it. Gate changed I had to painfully limp to new gate.

2022-01-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Atlanta via Ft Lauderdale,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no other airline as horrible in the US,True,"  In 2020, our JetBlue flight from FLL to ATL was delayed from 9:30pm to 1:45am takeoff. It was an awful experience. The airport terminal had shut down- no way in or out and all of the food vendors and shops were closed. They fed us chips and water after midnight. We received travel credits ($100 each for this experience). Fast forward to November 2021- I use these JetBlue travel credits to fly from SJO to ATL via FLL. Once again, JetBlue does the same exact thing. My flight from SJO to FLL was delayed to the point that there was absolutely no chance of making my connection in FLL, and there were no other JetBlue flights flying from FLL to ATL that night. Therefore, I'd have to find accommodations in Fort Lauderdale. I had to ask them to put me on a flight from SJO to Orlando, for which I bought a Frontier Airlines flight from ORL to ATL on my own ($150+) in order to make it home that night. No compensation, credit, or apology from JetBlue for their repeated fault, not that I'd want to fly them again, anyway.  I ended up having to pay for a flight that I shouldn't have in order to get out of the mess they created. There is no other airline as horrible in the US than JetBlue.",-1
2022-01-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to London via New York,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,Very poor customer service,True,"  First and last time flying with JetBlue. Our flight was delayed twice and rescheduled three times. December 31st, flight from JAX to JFK was delayed by 4 hours, this made us lose the the connection from JFK to London. Same flight was rescheduled for January 1st. JetBlue refused to pay a hotel but after waiting to see a supervisor that never showed up, they finally agreed to book us an accommodation. On the 1st we couldn’t find anywhere to take a COVID test around Jacksonville area. Then, they reschedule our flight for the 3rd, when next Covid test was available. We had to book a car for two days, luckily we had where to stay for the following two nights. The worse was the treatment from most of the JetBlue staff at Jacksonville Airport. They were extremely rude and unhelpful. Very poor customer service - shocking! On the 3rd the same happened. Flight from JAX was delayed and again we lost the connection from JFK. Arriving at the airport the supervisor asked us what we were doing there since we knew our flight was delayed. We contacted JetBlue (1h30 min waiting) prior going to the airport and we were advised to make our way there. Supervisor had a terrible attitude towards us. We then got the delayed flight to NY. Staff in NY airport was a bit more kind and polite. They booked us a hotel. Arriving at JFK airport on the following day we found out that there was earlier flight to London Gatwick (our flight was to Heathrow). I asked to change to Gatwick flight and after calling the supervisor and asking us to pay $75 (which I refused), they finally agreed to accommodate us on the earlier flight. The airline was empty but they gave us a seat in the last rows, close to the toilet. Travelling with JetBlue never again!",-1

My last four Jetblue flights have all been delayed for a total of over 10 hours, and all they do to compensate is give me TrueBlue points so I can book another flight that will get delayed. They refuse any other kind of compensation. Pretty pathetic airline, not worth the trouble.",-1

Just wonder how the Jet Blue management could schedule a international flight without proper resources!,-1
2022-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Denver,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,inconsistencies within their system,False," I was charged an additional $500 to add a cat to my flight due to inconsistencies within their system. The agent agreed with me that it’s a flaw in JetBlue’s system, but said there was nothing she could do besides cancelling my flight and charging me for a new one - aka forfeiting the cost I already paid with no credit in return. This then caused issues throughout the rest of my trip, which in turn required 4 hours of phone calls and 2 hours of additional attendant conversation at the terminal to sort out. We were then stuck at the airport for 10 hours due to delays and issues with timing and staffing.",-1
2022-01-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to San Diego,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,avoid traveling JetBlue at all cost,False, My flight was delayed twice! There’s always an issue with JetBlue being on time. I’ve travelled through JetBlue post pandemic and full pandemic it’s an issue for them to get it together. I am extremely dissatisfied and will avoid traveling JetBlue at all cost. On top of the fact that you have to pay for carryons. There’s literally no incentive to fly JetBlue any more.,-1
2022-01-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Providence,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,experience with JetBlue was terrible,False," I booked for a return flight from Tampa to Boston on December 28th. I paid extra to select seats for me, my wife, and my four years old daughter. I was in an airport hotel to catch the early morning (7AM) flight. In the middle of the night I got an e-mail that my flight was canceled. Than, later I booked for an evening flight (7:35PM) to Providence instead of Boston. In these challenging days cancellations can happen. My problem is how these big airline companies are prepared for this and how they handle the problem. When I called JetBlue customer service first I got an 152 minutes waiting time estimate. Second attempt was 85 minutes. This waiting time estimates and their greeting massage on the phone gives you the impression that do not call our customer service because we do not provide such thing; You are by your own. Then, I tried to fix things online and tried to make changes but the system did not allowed. I could not even checked in for the new flight that they booked me on the app. My several attempts failed at the very last page with an annoying ""Ooops...."" massage. When I arrived to the airport, they checked me in and they put me to the very last row with my family, although there were empty rows in the middle of the plane. Funny thing I already paid to be able to pick the seats but they put me to the very last row without a refund or any compensation for sending me another airport miles away from my destination. The very last row was apparently very narrow. Especially the seat on the window side was terrible, there was no window and you feel that you are suffocating because there is no oxygen. The seats cannot be reclined because they were blocked with the toilet wall right behind you. Overall travel experience with JetBlue was terrible.",-1

2022-01-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santo Domingo to New York,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,disregard for any concerns or time restriction,True,"  We trusted JetBlue with getting my 17 year old grandson from Salt Lake City to New York to a baseball camp in the Dominican Republic. Big Mistake! Huge! We found out the hard way, Jet Blue is the absolute worst airline ever when it comes to getting customers to their destination at all, let alone on time. From the get go, JB knew they were canceling flights, all day long, but nothing was relayed to their customers. So, everyone gets to the airport, then goes through the famous Jet Blue merry-go-round of excuses, as everyone associated with Jet Blue already knew there was no intention of ever leaving the airport. So, hour after hour passes, while more and more excuses were blathered about, before taking off six hours late. Of course, all connecting flights were missed, so the excuse go-round began again in New York. Arrived a day late in the DR. Fast forward to the return flight. Same old tired excuse parade, sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours, before it was announced the pilot was out-of hours. Seriously, they made everyone wait on the plane, until the pilot ran out of hours, then canceled the flight. Lay over in the D.R., trying to get back to Salt Lake, another day late. This airline has complete disregard for any concerns or time restrictions for any of their paying customers.",-1
2021-12-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Newark,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1,can't get refunded for their cancellation,False," Absolutely awful airline to deal with. The plane itself is pretty decent. The seats are decent, the amount of space you have is great and the free wifi and entertainment are plusses. The downside is when it comes to their flights being on time and their customer service. My first flight was delayed an hour, annoying but no biggie, it happens. But then it also took them forever to let us off the plane when we arrived at our destination. Also, minor inconvenience and irritating, but okay fine. What really pissed me off was for my second trip with them. I understand because of covid, flights were getting canceled, but I had to find out my flight was canceled when I went to check in. I didn't receive an email until after this. The email contained no information about the reason or what my options were. It was very brief and vague, stating only that they apologize for the inconvenience and they are looking into ways to fix it. That's it. They email me again a couple hours later with their ""solution"". It was to put me on a flight departing literally from a different state and arriving 1.5 hours away from my original destination. This was completely unacceptable. Their customer service line is basically useless. Could not get ahold of anyone and wait times were ridiculous. They have a live chat that you can do over iMessage, I attempted that and it just told me no one was available to chat. I later tried again with the live chat, this time mentioning the department of transportation, and suddenly I am able to get into the queue for a representative It said wait time was ""longer than 15min"". I waited 3.5 hours. I was finally able to talk to someone (her response times were very slow might I add) and she told me there was a flight available the next day. Why they didn't put me on that flight in the first place instead of trying to fly me out of a different state is beyond me. I said great, lets do it. She books the flight for me and I go to manage it on their website to choose my seat and an error pops up when I try to locate my reservation. I ask her why and she says it is just due to how many changes it has gone through and offers to select my seat for me. My only options are middle seats in the back or one window seat 2 rows from the back. My original seat was near the from of the mid-section of the plane. But I just decided to bite the bullet and take my rear window seat. I then inquire about the error I am continuing to receive when trying to look up my reservation, as I was concerned that I would be unable to check in if the system doesn't even recognize my reservation. She tells me I will just need to check in at the airport. At this point, I am over it. I did not want to risk any more issues, I asked to cancel the flight and get a full refund. She says okay, then I wait 20 min. I received only confirmation of the cancelation, not the refund. I message again asking to confirm the refund and suddenly I am connected to a new representative. The next one tells me I cannot get a refund only travel credits. This is bc I had changed my original flight before this mess happened. But the JetBlue website doesn't refund you the fare difference if your new flight is cheaper. I was going to fly before the trip I was purchasing so I just decided to use the difference to help pay for the other flight. In order to do that, I had to cancel that reservation for travel credits. So, bc of this I can't get refunded for their cancellation.",-1
2021-12-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Newark,,,,,,,1,they are not professional,True,  I am extremely upset. I purchased a total of 6 ticket for my family and I to go on a vacation in California to only get a emails the night before stating they have canceled our flight! This is not acceptable and not fair to my family. I got no explanation to why it was canceled and when I tried to reach out to them on live chat it stated no one was available to chat with. Within minutes of reason this email. Now I’m on a 150 minute wait time from the call center. For someone who spent a lot of money with company they are not professional.,-1

2021-12-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Austin,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they kicked my family off the flight,True,"  Worst experience of my life. The pilot was taking her time after boarding. All the instructions had already been explained. And they sat there for an additional 20 mins after instructions were instructed. So I got up to use restroom, it was an emergency. The flight attendant had the nerve to block the bathroom and tell me to sit back down. I said that it was an emergancy. And they kicked my family off the flight. This is unbelievable and unfair. And we're stuck without a flight back home. I am not okay with this.",-1
2021-12-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to New York JFK,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1, The worst customer service,False," My JetBlue flight to JFK delayed by 1hr and 30 mins, due to this not able to catch my international (Etihad) connection flight. The customer service provided for us is horrible and all JetBlue representatives (over ticketing counter, baggage claim and customer call over phone) are being rude to us and doesn’t provide any solution on my missing baggage at this point. Simply sending back and forth between them and Etihad for the mistake done by JetBlue. Myself and family frustrated much for traveling with Jetblue. I would strongly recommend not to fly JetBlue if you like a stress free travel. It is not only me. My co passengers around 26 persons affected by JetBlue who missed our connection flights. They delayed, didn’t provide any accommodation, missed one of my baggage and didn’t accept my complaint till now. The worst customer service and fly I ever experienced.",-1
2021-12-23,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Syracuse,3.0,,5.0,,,4.0,2,I had to pay $65 for my carryon,False,"  My mother booked this flight through Expedia in early November. Expedia clearly advises to look up JetBlue baggage fees. We looked up the fees at time of booking this is from jetblue.com: JetBlue (B6) allows 1 carry-on bag and 1 personal item (purse, briefcase, laptop bag) per passenger fee free. Carry-on should not exceed the following size and weight restrictions: 45 linear inches (22 x 14 x 9 in) or 115 centimeters (56 x 36 x 23 cm) including handles and wheels2021. When I was at the airport on December 22, 2021 I was informed I had to pay $65 for my carryon (it was the correct dimensions and weight). Reached out to JetBlue via CHAT. They said, ""you assume a certain amount of risk booking through a third party."" I copy and pasted the information available from jetblue.com at the time of booking (see above)! I received NO REPLY from jetblue on chat. This is an example of ""Bait and switch"" that this ""low cost"" airline engages in.",-1
2021-12-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Newark,,,,,,,1,you don’t get your money back,True,  I found Out that I contracted Covid 3 days before my flight. And JetBlue has a new policy where they don’t accommodate people who contract covid and if you cancel your flight with the basic plan you have to pay 100$ and you don’t get your money back. The rest of the Money goes as a credit. But who expects to catch covid before their flight. I probably Will not travel with them any longer because it’s very unacceptable.,-1
2021-12-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Barbados,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,the most appalling service,False," The most appalling service (or lack thereof) I’ve ever seen in my 50+ years of travelling. I bought the tickets 10 months ago and paid extra for baggage, priority boarding, more space seats and bought the seats so all 6 of us were in a row together. JetBlue then changed the flight time (5 times) and the plane which meant we ended up with no seats. When I tried to select the seats, the computer kept saying I had to pay for them. I called up and waited on the phone for an hour - no one ever picked up. Then I went to the online chat and eventually (after an hour and a half ended up with new seats but we weren’t sitting together). They told me I could ask the person to move when I boarded the plane as they couldn’t move someone’s seat (ironic as they had already moved us from the seats we bought!). The worst part, however, was arriving at JFK at 3 am (they had moved our original 10 am flight to 6 am) as they said we needed to arrive 3 hours early or we missed risking our flight. They were right because check in is ab absolute disaster. There are hordes of people everywhere - my son lived in Kenya for a while and he said that this was a much, much worse experience than Nairobi airport. And that’s saying something! It took us two hours to check in and get through security - awful. Once we got on the plane, I asked the woman to move to the row in front so I could sit with my children. A window seat for a window seat. She refused and then started swearing at me. The steward then said she has a right not to move - which is obviously true but I’ve been in the same situation and have always moved so that families can be together. The steward was incredibly rude to me - I’ve literally never been spoken to like that by a crew member in my life. For the positive, the seat is comfortable. That’s literally the only positive thing I can say. I will never, ever fly Je Blue again. They have the only direct flight from NYC to Barbados but, next time, I will fly any normal airline and take a layover over the worst travel experience of my life. Avoid them at all costs. They are disgusting.",-1

High-level, they damaged my stroller, and instead of owning to that damage, they blamed me for not having a cover for their employees damaging my property.

After learning that I paid for the bag $30. I showed up at the airport 55 minutes before the flight. At the kiosk  I was told they were not accepting anymore bags.

Very aggressive ground staff both sides. Couldn’t give us seats online or at check in. Went to a jet blue (just ask) and they couldn’t assign seats but amazing they could give you more legroom or upgrade for a price. Went to gate for seat assignments it was like dealing with prison wardens. Told me we know your details and we will call you. So go away was the message. To top it off both our new suitcases bought the day before in Orlando are a complete write off. Sickness me the treatment we encountered. P,-1

It was absolutely outrageous and disgusting from the horrifying mess at the check-in to boarding, to unspeakable experience in-flight. Miserable, uncomfortable hard seats with no cushion and almost no recline on-board their retrofitted A320 made our backs numb and painful for 3 days after the flight. It took us even longer to recuperate after 4 hour agony claustrophobic, stuffed with people to the point of no return metal tube. It seemed that they increased the amount of rows they used to have in the same plane by many and ""Even More Space Seats"" were no different than others. Disrespectful careless flight attendants who made gibberish announcements all the time and did not allow people to go to the stinky, dirty toilets were more suited for human-free janitorial services than caring for the people. Never again in this life I will take this company's product even if if it's free. Shame on them.",-1

My last flight 12/3/21, all 3 flight attendants were non existent, except for snack time. Almost half of the planes masks were not being worn. Jet Blue needs to improve greatly on their in flight customer service. I've been recently alternating flights with Delta and so far I'm much more satisfied.

2021-12-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Dallas to San Juan via New Yorkl,,,,,,,1,not be flying JetBlue ever again,True,"  I booked my flight online on November 29, 2021. I booked one flight for December 2 at 3:20 in the afternoon. Apparently when I booked a duplicate booking was created with a flight of 715am. Later, customer service, after three hours and 30 minutes of waiting, told me that when two bookings are made when is canceled by the system. Apparently the system canceled my 320 flight and never informed me that there was a 715 flight nor that they made the cancellation of the 320pm flight. After I drove four hours to the airport the ticket agent informed me that there was no record of me creating a booking for 3:20 PM. I called customer service but was on hold forever before somebody answered. My flight left before customer service took my call. The first lady I spoke to was very nice and offered me a $50 voucher for a future flight which is fairly useless. They escalated my complaint and I was sent to one of the customer service managers. The customer service manager was extraordinarily rude and condescending and told me there was nothing she could do and that it was my fault. I offered her proof that I never made the 715 booking and asked why I was not informed of the duplicate booking or that one had been canceled. I asked her to be empathetic and put yourself in my shoes. She told me what she felt didn’t matter and that all she would offer me was a $50 voucher and that only because it was offered to me by the previous customer service rep. She said I shouldn’t even get that but that she was offering it to me out of kindness because it was already offered. Now I am out babysitter fees, rebooking of a babysitter, hotel reservations for the night, a missed business meeting, 8 Hours drive time back-and-forth from the airport etc. All I asked for was a reasonable accommodation. I said I would take a $50 refund on my ticket (not a voucher for a future flight), I would take an upgrade to first class, I would even take a five dollar gift card to Starbucks but they were unwilling to do anything other than offer me a $50 voucher for a future flight that I nor anyone from my company is going to take because we will not be flying JetBlue ever again.

We flew on an old, small plane. The plane’s interior was dirty and some of the chairs were broken. We were told to board the aircraft. So we did. After a few minutes they told us to disembark due to a smell on the plane. No one knew where the odor was coming from. After a half hour passed the flight attendants told us to get on the plane. Still not knowing where the smell was coming from or if it was even safe to travel on the aircraft. We decided to trust the staff at JetBlue. When we landed in New Jersey (thank god), the aircraft door would not open. We stayed in the plane for over an hour. Finally they brought a movable stairway which was super steep. I almost fell down the stairs. I will not be flying JetBlue anymore. I will continue to fly United. Be ware of JetBlue. They are not a great airline and customer service is horrible.",-1
2021-11-27,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to New York,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3,worst customer service ever,True,"  The worst customer service ever. I got my seat next to emergency exit. When I get to my seat there was a flight attendant standing  where is my seat were. He didn’t greet me , I told him “ hi, here is my seat“. He looked at me and didn’t say anything. And he had kept staying at the same spot. I repeat myself and after he decided to move and let me seat. I asked him a couple questions regarding opening of emergency door, because I was told earlier I have to perform this in order of emergency. But he was very sarcastic and just pointed to the door without any explanations. When we were offered drinks, I asked him to give me 2 glasses of water, but he ignored me, even though I repeat it 3 times. He never gave it to me. And he was acting with everyone so rude, like we are own him something. Very disrespectful. At the end of the flight he never said “bye and thanks to flying with us”, even though I said “thank you and have a good night”. I believe the company have to fire people who treats passengers this way. Even though I like to fly with Jet blue after this experience I’m really concerned about next flight with JetBlue, I haven’t ever met such a rude ignorant and disrespectful flight attendant.",-1

Using credits, or open tickets is impossible with wait times exceeding a necessary limit. Waste of time and honestly money. It's not the employees at all but the system they use. Stephanie on chat could not help me or navigate me so I can do it myself because JetBlue contracts with other companies and does not give them the option. They have no way to link open tickets to new reservations without calling in. Which is where the frustrating part comes in. This took away from my experience and left a terrible taste in my mouth. Wish you could correct this JetBlue. It would be so much better for employees if the option was available for customers and guest online. I also had to wait again because a guy answered the phone I told him my situation and he put me on hold again. Then a woman answered and I told her the same thing I told the man and she let me know only supervisors can do this, she put me on hold again. Personally forget this airline. If there are any changes you might need or an accommodations, prepare to be screwed unless you like wasting time on the phone waiting. Hopefully for your sake they fix this issue. Won't be using them again and if they don't fix this they will be losing quite a large amount of customers as well. Hey JetBlue you want to lower your prices to dirt cheap because customers will all eventually chose another airline if this persists.",-1
2021-11-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,1.0,1,Jetblue has no regard to travelers needs,True,"  We recently had a flight booked through a codeshare with JetBlue flying Qatar Airways to travel to the Maldives from O'hare. The dates for travel Monday October 4th and Sunday October 10th.  When we arrived at O'hare on the 4th we were informed by the Qatar employee checking passports and PCRs that I was already checked in which is impossible since we had a codeshare and had to check in at the airport. The next employee informed us that JetBlue put both tickets under my husbands ticket number and that we had to contact JetBlue to get them to reissue the tickets correctly. After being on hold for 2 1/2 hours to talk to a representative to try and resolve the issue; mind you the ticket desk was closing and we were potentially going to miss the flight due to a major JetBlue error to our flight tickets. My husband finally got through to a gentleman who was able to quickly fix the issue 10 minutes after the ticket desk closed. The Qatar employee was amazing holding the ticket counter open for us 10 minutes after it closed, hoping this could get resolved and gladly rushed us to the plane.  At the resort my husband was in contact with the JetBlue customer service messenger. He wanted to check and make sure our tickets home would be correct and that there would be no issues with our return flight. We were reassured that all the issues with our tickets were resolved and we would have any issues at the airport. When we arrived at the ticket counter at Male we were immediately informed that there was a major issue with our tickets. Imagine our surprise that there was another JetBlue error after we were reassured twice that everything with our tickets were fixed! We were informed that there was no ticket for me, that it was cancelled by Jetblue and that my husbands ticket was inactive and the way to fix that was to contact JetBlue customer service. At this point we tried to contact JetBlue via phone and messenger with no luck, Qatar also had no such luck. You only have so much time at the airport before boarding a flight or the last flights of the day take off. With no hope of getting in contact with JetBlue we had to purchase flights through a different carrier to get home, which ended up costing us $3906.14 out of pocket for an inexcusable error on JetBlue that we were informed multiple times that it was resolved! When I contacted JetBlue on October 12 to get this situation rectified she was on hold for over 3 hours to only get a refund for the flight that we were unable to take due to JetBlue cancelling my ticket and their inefficiency to release my husbands ticket correctly or have timely customer service. We were also given $100 travel credit which we currently have no desire to ever fly JetBlue again due to how terrible this experience was and how poorly it was rectified. We should not have had to spend the $3906.14 on tickets to fly home when multiple errors were not done on our part but rather your company.  We had to get home due to jobs, children, and an expiring PCR test. I have now filed out a reimbursement form twice with Jetblue and no one has been in contact with me. Jetblue needs to refund us the extra money we had to spend to return home due to their errors. They canceled my return ticket leaving us with no choice but to purchase additional tickets! Jetblue has no regard to travelers needs or even respect for them.",-1
2021-11-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to New York,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,experience was the worst and dishonest one,True,"  Jetblue started playing the flight delaying time game. They started the game with a 15 min delay, another 45 min announcement, then 90 min. Jetblue kept adding time till 6 hours of delay with different excuses. In an attempt to claim us (the travelers), different voices spoke to us. They made the flight delayed announcement, including the captain and crew team supervisor. I had a trip from Chicago to New York, connecting to an international flight I went to the Jetblue boarding counter multiple times, and they reassured me that I'd make it and they were going to fix the technical problem on time. At 10:00, I went back to the Jetblue counter again because they announced further delay till 11:30 and I wouldn't make it. The front desk staff was on the phone after 1 hour, waiting to be online with the support team. The support team reassured me that they would rebook my flight on the same class after I insisted. They tried to rebook my flight, which was 13 hours long on-air on a smaller airplane with low-rating airlines, and I refused! Then they said Oh sir, we don't see your business upgrade in our system. We do apologize and will book you on Economic! Jetblue front desk staff reassured me that since I didn't use my ticket, I got a refund for my business upgrade from the other airline. I later spoke to other airline. They said it's clear in our systems that you were in business class and rebooked on economic! and they provided me with EMD receipt I went back to the Jetblue counter in New York Twice terminal 5, and they made me go in cycles forward and backward. Initially, they told me the ticket on other airline speak to other airline to upgrade and fix it for you. I went to other airline terminal 8, and they said it was not true. The one who bought this ticket is JetBlue. I went back to Jetblue on terminal 5. They said no, sir, we can't do anything to you. This complimentary ticket we cannot upgrade you we don't offer rebooking with business class! Your only option is to either take the airplane or cancel the ticket and issue a new one! I took the flight unwillingly since I didn't have any other option. Adding to this, on Oct 29, on my coming flight from JFK to ORD, Jetblue lost my baggage. Jetblue didn't load the bags on the airplane. All my items and personal care were in the baggage. I had to buy unnecessarily new things to be in good hygiene. At last, they delivered the bags after 2 days on Oct 31. My experience with Jetblue was the worst and dishonest one. 1- baggage losses and flight delays 2- Trying to rebook on smaller, low rating, cheaper ticket 3- Disrespect, dishonest and telling inaccurate information and assurances 4- New rebooked ticket: downgraded ticket business to economic class on 13 hours flight, extra stop with waiting 7 hours in between, and inconvenient timing arrival at 3 AM 5- I didn't get what I paid for, which is unfair. Rebooked ticket is cheaper than the original one, and I didn't get my business class refund as Jetblue claimed that I would. I received an apology email from the airline with a travel credit of $200 valid for 1 year with limited usage only on Jetblue. After this bad experience, I don't intend to go with Jetblue in the future!",-1

Original departure time: 3:40 PM. This was my return flight home and we ended up departing at 6:42PM (same time we here supposed to be landing). They hold us the entire 3 hours+ boarding sitting in the plane. They never said why we did not departed on time. It was just crazy, so much time inside the plane when it was supposed to be a 3 hour flight and it took 100% more time. No excuses and no food beside their chips. They should offer an explanations and a sincere apology. I had not flown with Jetblue for a while, they used to be good. Now I had done the the last to trips with them but after this I do not think if I will ever choose them again. They did offer to give us earbuds for some entertainment for the 6 hours but did not have any to give us.",-1

We were on the plane at the gate for 3 hours and 30 minutes and were told it would be 30 minutes. I called the airline to request a voucher for the major inconvenience and was told from the Representative Carol that that happens. I have been flying wit JetBlue for over 20 years and never have I experience such terrible customer service and disrespectful response. I was given a $50 credit and I payed $30 for my luggage. My wife has not received any kind of compensation. The worst service in my 45 years of flying experience. Not even a apology. Unacceptable!,-1

Nothing is right .. the app does not work as it should, we cannot get boarding passes after checking in, it has been so screwed up, we've had the counter agent call a regional supervisor to override system errors.

His flight was to leave November 8th at 6.30 am, when he got to JFK they told them his tickets were canceled. They said the only thing they could do was to refund his tickets and the next flight left at 5 pm that day and it would cost an additional $700. He was in shock, the only reason they could give for canceling his tickets that he paid for they said were miscellaneous issues. He felt he had no choice but to purchase the tickets.

My disappointment in the JetBlue staff and management team is hard to express with words. I pre-purchased a luggage for $35 because it was not included in my ticket, however, I brought a suitcase of the size of a carry-on. I went to check in my suitcase but the staff member told me that I can bring the bag with me because it was the size of a carry-on. However, when I got to my gate the management team forced me to pay an additional $65 for my suitcase because it was not checked. When I tried to explain the situation the check-in lady and a manager were so rude and disrespectful to me that I was shocked. The whole situation was absurd and I will make sure that neither I nor my friends and acquaintances will ever fly JetBlue because an airline like that should not stay in business if they treat their customers with such disrespect and disregard.

All we were looking to do was change the connecting flight from 518 to 118 as it is a shorter layover. We called customer service and the woman said we had to cancel the flight first, then re-book.

I asked to get my 100 dollars back because nobody else is having to pay and customer service said no. They say people can’t change seats on the plane, but I informed them that they are and the crew is allowing it. People are in the exit row without verbal confirmation of their willingness or paying the fee. The exit row is blocked by luggage, as well.

It was not until I checked in for the flight that I learned that I could not carry on a bag, I was forced to check it. I never check baggage, I travel the world with what I can carry in a backpack as a carry-on, so this demand that I check was a serious problem. I arrived at the airport, and went to check the bag, as I was being forced to do, and was charged $35 US for the privilege. This should be illegal, and is certainly fraud.

The staff are rude and nasty, the are very dishonest about delays. I wish to have a conversation with the CEO of Jetblue to identify how incompetent he or she is. All the executives are hiding from their customers and they have sealed off all locations where you can walk in. If you try to call customer service be prepared to wait on hold for 6-10 hours.

I gave my dog a relaxing dog treat as recommended by the vet and he pulled out of his bag for a second which is how I feed him. They then rudely told me I was being uncompliant and they pushed and manhandled me off the plane in front of the entire plane and sent me back to the gate. When I arrived at the gate they discovered that I was indeed telling the truth and I was allowed back. The flight got delayed by 30 minutes.

I purchased a flight, needed to cancel, waited 3 hours on hold for them to tell me they cancelled it and could only provide me a credit. Credit was supposed to go to my email same day. The following day, nothing. I call again, hold for an hour to be hung up on. Attempted to go through the chat, they were less than helpful (hours wasted), they ended up telling just to call. I called, 5 hours on hold later and I was told I had to book another reservation with the supervisor. Then I was told that if my new flight didn't total my old one, I would lose the difference.

Our only solution to rent a car and drive to Orlando, at 2am to get there for a 6:00 am flight , renting a car was $200, Not only driving an hour and a half, JetBlue didn’t announce a cancellation because they don’t want to refund, they kept saying delayed delayed to the next day.

I planned a couples trip to Jamaica for my 40th. We was supposed to have a connecting flight through Florida but they changed for us to go through NY which didn't make any sense.The flight going to Jamaica was fine and on time but the flight coming home was a nightmare from hell! First we had a hour delay coming out of Jamaica then when we connected in NY again it just got worst and worst. We had a delay again but for hours then there was a slight rainstorm but then it stop and for some reason jetblue canceled all the flights. They didn't offer any voucher for hotel or anything. We had to search hours and hours to get a hotel because they were all sold out they rescheduled our flight for the next day all the way at night like 8pm which was crazy. Then when we got back to the airport they changed our gate twice, there was another delay for another two hours because they were waiting for another plane to leave. When we finally got on the plane the captain says we have to wait for someone to put the bags on and to pull plane out, we are short staffed so that was another hour at this point I was so frustrated cause I just want to go home, its going on midnight now when we were supposed to leave at 8pm.",-1

First they said they only refund a Jetblue credit note but the app allowed me to select full credit card refund. The big problem is I called them and as they have no customer services in the UK I spent £40 on talking to customer services. I now found an online chat to them, you have to wait online for approx 45 mins and have to type any questions but cheaper than phone, so much work and a lot of fuss and stress to use. They are a USA domestic airline who are just not geared up to transatlantic flights. Will never use again. They have paid back for flight and one of the seat reservations so I feel I have to go back and claim via credit card company, so much easier than trying to talk to JetBlue.",-1

We arrived to JFK to find out our final leg of the trip had been cancelled. JetBlue decided that we could spend 2 days/nights in NYC without Hotel reservations and booked us on a flight to Rochester 2 days later, not going to work for us due to Nephews Wedding that weekend. A JetBlue Customer Service Manager at JFK told us that the cancellation was due to Logistics but JetBlue would say it was weather, he gave us his name and credentials. Our trip to Rochester was a 5.5 hour car ride in a rental car that cost us approximately $500. When we contacted to JetBlue to see about some sort of reimbursement for our expenses and inconvenience we were not so politely told ""No"" and that was it, they said it was weather related just as the Manager had said they would do. It was obvious that they don't care and have lost us as customers, we don't fly a lot but we do fly 3-4 times a year and will be sure to tell this story whenever possible.",-1

The first delay I was ok with, then the second, then the third because we had to wait for a pilot to get there from JFK. I started reading reviews and it seems this is normal for them. Don’t have flights you can’t staff. Getting on the plane I noticed how disgusting it was. I mean, spilled white something stuck to the seat, chocolate (maybe) caked on the arm rest, broken tray table, nasty everywhere. It looked like the plane hasn’t been cleaned in months. During a pandemic you would think cleanliness would be a priority. The “Fly- Fi” also didn’t not work during the flight. The bars were there but nothing worked or loaded. I will never fly this airline again.",-1

2021-09-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Buffalo,,,,,,1.0,1,total lack of compassion ,False,"  My wife and 4 year old daughter had their flight from JFK to Buffalo cancelled. It was supposed to leave at 4;30pm yesterday, 11/23. It was cancelled at midnight after they had to spent all day at the airport. Once cancelled, they had to wait over 4 hours in line for help. No help was given. No reason for cancellation or opportunity for them to get on a flight the next day. They were going to see her parents. There was no compassion or sympathy shown. The customer service has been the worst we've ever experienced. I finally had someone call me back. He could not care less about my wife and daughter and also showed no compassion. I'm amazed. He spoke to me in a condescending tone with sarcasm and then got upset with me once I got mad at his total lack of compassion or willingness to help, even threatening me. I'm distraught that my wife and 4 year old daughter had to go through this experience, and I'm deeply disappointed in the total lack of compassion shown by everyone at Jet Blue when dealing with my wife, daughter, and me, who was understandably upset and concerned over the treatment of my family.",-1

That is what Aeroflot told me at check in and kindly offered a flight on September 23. To my surprise jetblue 8 pm flight was rescheduled for a few times, passengers were rescheduled to different times and gates till 1 am. Finally it was cancelled again.

As I sit here on the plane after an unplanned almost 8 hour layover, I can’t help by think about how we should be in San Juan, Puerto Rico celebrating my cousin’s birthday (today is her actual birthday). We arrived to Fort Lauderdale around 9am or do for a connecting flight to San Juan due to arrive at 3:30pm. We were supposed to leave for San Juan at 1:10pm but they sent us an email pushing it back to 4:10pm with no explanation. We were finally able to board at 5:00pm. JetBlue then had all passengers in the middle of a COVID pandemic sit on the plane in very close quarters for an additional 2 hours as we waited for a pilot. We have missed a whole day that was paid for in San Juan, on my cousin’s birthday. Customer service is horrible. I would have rather gone with Spirit. At least we’d be there by now.",-1

2021-09-23,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Las Vegas via New York JFK,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,poor communication,False," Boston to Las Vegas via New York JFK 9/16/21: Our flight from Boston to Raleigh was cancelled on June 11th we then got Boston to JFK to Las Vegas flight 817 and it got cancelled due to “No crew available” but the loop hole you guys are using is that it did not get cancelled. It got delayed 3 hours but the thing is we would have then missed our lay over in JFK and been stuck there. That should not be a delay that should be considered a cancellation but you guys are using that as a loop hole. Our next available flight to Las Vegas was flight 777 departing around 4:32 pm in the afternoon. We wasted a whole day at the airport because Jet Blue had no crew members available. That is not the clients problem that is a jet blue problem for not having crew members. So our original flight that did not take off was at 5:45 am, the next flight was a direct flight because we could not make our layover due to the “no crew member available” delay was flight 777 at around 4:32 pm. So we were basically at the airport for 9 and a half hours. I am beyond frustrated. This is not fair. I tried speaking to one of your customer service reps and she then disconnected the call. I don’t ask for a refund but I do ask for some compensation as I do enjoy flying with jet blue but this is unacceptable and a big company like jet blue is using loopholes to avoid paying reliable clients. The flight to JFK did not get cancelled but it got delayed 3 hours we wouldn’t have been able to make our connection. We waiting 9 hours at the airport.

My wife and I are all in a favor of holding accountable passengers that don’t behave or are unwilling to comply with airlines regulations.

Unfortunately, this flight was delayed for maintenance and the airline offered to go to NY JFK airport to take the midnight flight instead of coming back the next day. They offered me transportation but I had to argue to get a food voucher of $16.00 (I thought I would get more). They sent me to JFK more than 6 hours difference to my new flight. I could not sit, check my luggage or eat at the airport until I was able to drop my luggage, I was tired, hungry and my phone was dying, nobody provided me with special services since I have a back condition. I had to beg to take my luggage around 5.30 pm and the employee who helped me was king enough to change the seat to 1F, thinking I am flying on first class, not at all, they eliminate the first class service, they have converted into a charter plane. Plane left on time and I was able to rest after more than 24 hours without sleeping or eating. The odyssey did not end, on my return after 6 days, the flight back to FLL was ok but returning to EWR was the worst experience I ever had, the first plane was damaged, they claimed it was the GPS and the antenna and they tried to fixed it while all of us were sitting inside the plane, after an hour the captain mentioned that it will be not possible to fix the problem and they will provide us with a new plane, we supposed to leave at 9.30 am and it was 11.15 already and we learned we had to switch planes, I was ok with that because I would not agree to take off on a damaged plane, they brought the new plane and around 12.30 pm the plane take off with a bad a/c, all I felt after that was fear because the plane was giving other issues that I could not understand, I believe that this company JetBlue is having so many maintenance issues that is putting at risk all public who travels using this airline. I would not travel again unless I use non stop. Not sure if I will fly on this airline again.",-1

The A321 had was awesome cabin lighting, our seat screens were pinned against the wall in the front and we got free unlimited wifi throughout the flight. Hazel, one of the FA’s, was very professional and made sure I had a full filling experience inflight and that I got the vegetarian option I needed for the meal service. The food was really good and my meal consisted of a Salad, pasta, ice cream with jelly on outside, and a tomato soup.

This is the second time in less than a month. My flight has been delayed four more hours, with no explanation but no crew. If that’s the case then cancel flights instead of having people waiting four hours. It wasn’t just my flight, every JetBlue flight was delayed.

I applied to receive a credit card through JetBlue. Their wait times are ridiculous I have spent about 2 hours and 40 minutes waiting for a supervisor. While looking at my statements just because I bought a flight for JetBlue they have charged me $18.25 for every ticket I purchase, they charge seats, and when I went to the counter they denied me ever purchasing the seat. The price they charged me was $53.15 for a seat I never sat in. When I called the bank, the bank informed me that I need to call JetBlue directly. When speaking to the representative she says that there is nothing in record of my purchases and sent me over to my bank. I have spent 15 days calling my bank and they redirect me to JetBlue while JetBlue redirects me to my bank. The representative repeatedly told me that she has no information and that she cannot help me. I asked her to redirect me to a supervisor and the supervisor never answered the phone.

I was going to travel with my 6 year old daughter in August and coming back home in September. I purchased the tickets in mid May, I paid for my bags and the Even More Space seats over the phone. A week before traveling I received a notification that I was going to loose my seat if I don’t pay for it. I immediately call the airline and they said not to pay attention to that automatic message because everything was paid off. I call back the following day because I was concerned and just wanted to make sure everything was in order. The day that we were returning back home, we were at the Jetblue counter, the Jetblue employee told me I didn’t have a seat (remember I purchased the Even More Space seat for me and my 6 year old in May). I explained everything to her and showed her the confirmation that I got in the email. She had the audacity to tell me she can’t help me and that she can give me a seat in the back row while my daughter is sitting in the 5th row. I end up calling Customer service and waited 2 hours for someone to help me, because the lady at the counter keep saying “I can’t help you”.",-1

It kicks us both out of the process about 1/2 way through and says “Oops! We cannot process your request”. This happens both in a browser on the website and in the app. Very frustrating. That means we have to get to the airport lots sooner and stand in line to check in (we tried on our flight out and could not check in at the kiosk either). Took us about an hour at the airport, standing in line, to check in for our flights. Very poor procedures and “traffic flow” for something that should be simple. Flight took off on time and was fine, even arrived early but none of the entertainment options were working (no TV no audio). So I didn’t give 1 star (gave it 4 because it was a good flight). The preflight chaos colored our entire trip. It was a 5 hour flight with no entertainment for those who are used to inflight options so no longer bring their own.",-1

Next best flight was 9/2 at 11:30 p.m. from Ontario, 3 hour cab ride to get there; however, had to check out of hotel by 1p.m. No car, nothing to do. Took cab at 1p.m., got to airport by 3p.m. (no traffic). Flight delayed 1.5 hours! Get to Kennedy timely only to wait 1.75 hours for luggage. No explanation as to why and nobody to ask. An absolute joke. No radio from the baggage claim to the luggage workers.  Zero leadership skills, zero communication skills. The $100 credit didn’t cover additional expenditures, tip for the cab driver for a $400 fare, food, missed medication, inconvenience, etc., being completely exhausted. Such poor, poor management!",-1

I kept going back and forth asking the rudest agent ever about the time. The last time I spoke to her was at 2.30, asked her what time we should line up? She said you have another 30-35 mins! We received an email saying the departure at 3.15. When we went to the gate at 2.45 (even before we received the email) we found the gate is closed and the worst agent ever started to curse and yell at us! When I gave her the attitude back, she threatened me that she won’t let me in if I kept the attitude (as she has the ultimate power). Attached is a picture of the email that was sent at 2.55 after they closed the gate! I won’t let this go until whoever gave us the bad experience gets held accountable.

Both flights delayed for no apparent reason skies are clear. Do yourself a favor, stay away if you can.

My ticket was checked and prior to checking my tickets, one of the workers said my bookbag and my sons was too big and my nieces bag was too big. The employee was rude, told me to remove any laptops from the bag and the fee will be 60 dollars for each bag to fly. I paid 190 for all bags. My 9 year old had less clothes so his book bag was smaller. They didn't do anything for me as a courtesy, I was told we didn't want to miss our flight to hurry up. Worst experience ever. I'm pregnant, also my son is special needs and he was upset as well. First time I have experienced this with any airline. Spirit and Delta never treated me this way.",-1
2021-08-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Nantucket,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,It is beyond shocking to see JetBlue fail so badly,True," Below outlines a series of customer service failures from JetBlue that erode hard won customer trust and from which it is hard to recover: 1) I got notified less than 90 min before flight #2288 from Newark to ACK was to take off that it was cancelled. No explanation given just a cancellation notification with a rescheduled flight for the next day. Cost to me: 2.5 hours of travel time to and from airport ($100+) and missed work time. 2) My rebooked flight leaving Newark at 10.10a bound for ACK switched gates 2x in the span of an hour with no text notification or phone call, causing me to miss my flight and go through different security lines 3x in an attempt to reach the right gate (others experienced this same problem). Again the cost to me and others (time and money) is significant. Details are as follows: I arrived at 8.45a went through security to get to the assigned gate 18, only to learn via my e-boarding pass that the gate had changed to gate 21. This required me to go to a different part of the airport with another security check in. I did this and arrived at the new gate 21 only to learn when I tried to board that the flight had been changed back to gate 18. I raced back to the other part of the airport passing through another security check point only to be told the gate 18 was now closed (it was 10a) and that I missed my flight. To be clear, I did not get a txt msg or a phone call notification of the gate change and my e-boarding pass still had gate 21 listed. Reinforcing the lack of value and respect that Jet Blue has for its customers was the $50 credit I received at 9.45am. This does not begin to cover the costs to me for Jet Blue’s failures over the past 24 hours and shows an utter disrespect for my time or patronage. It is beyond shocking to see JetBlue fail so badly. The only bright spot was an employee at the ticket counter who patiently tried to help but in the end was not empowered to do anything meaningful to compensate for her employer’s poor customer service.",-1

2021-08-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"idiotic, incompetent and unorganized",True,"  JetBlue has provided me the worst airline experience I ever had. I booked a flight with 3 friends from EWR-MIA on August 21st 2021, our departure was initially at 8:45pm. We arrive by 6:30pm to check in our bags. Everything seemed fine until 8:30pm and the boarding process hasn’t started. Strange enough, our flight has been delayed until 9:30pm due to a gate change. After 9:30pm, once again the staff announced yet another delay until 10:40pm. Once it hit 11:00pm, the staff once again announced a different gate change and now the flight will take off by 1:00am. Frustrated and concerned, we waited patiently. The staff announced at 1:10am that our plane has arrived. All passengers eagerly get up and form a line to board. 20 min later, the staff announces that the plane did not have functioning AC and they will be waiting for the airplane to “cool off.” Strange, but ok. At 2:00am on the DOT, they announce our flight is cancelled. 6 hours waiting. We go down to get our checked bags and they are nowhere to be found. Not 1 staff was able to provide information as to where our checked bags were. In conclusion it took 2 HOURS for most passengers to retrieve their checked bags since they “misplaced” our bags at the wrong gate 4:00AM and trying to figure out how we could revoke our tickets and get our refund. Still in the process. Did not provide hotels and made us wait an hour for a taxi. Their staff told passengers to get a hotel in Boston. Boston isn’t even in the same state as New Jersey, their staff doesn’t contain basic knowledge. All I have to say is, JetBlue has the most idiotic, incompetent and unorganized staff. I will never be flying with JetBlue in my life.",-1
2021-08-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Punta Cana via JFK,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,so disgusted with Jetblue,True,"  Let me start of by saying that jet blue has to be the worse airline I have traveled in my 43 years. I will be taking this message and my review to every Avenue possible to expose the terrible customer service you have given us on my trip to punta Cana from San Francisco. From The start we had a six hour delay in San Francisco missed two connections, The agent at SFO rudely told us well if you don’t move your seat to the front and sit at the seats that you are sitting you won’t make your connection. They split our family up with a 8yo, to move this to the front, finally got to JFK had three minutes to get on another plane in New York, then being told by another Jet Blue agent so rudely don’t worry this is an international flight you will get your bag however being the law we never boarded the flight with our bags. Arrived in DR are bags were lost, they never made the flight. Went to the so-called baggage claim there the JetBlue agent wrote everything out on the paper. And obviously messed up there because the next day we got an email saying our bags was being sent to Punta Cana however the moment when it arrived there they sent it to the wrong resort. In the meanwhile we were told that they were going to be reimbursed for the items that we bought we had to spend $80 in taxi fees to get to the ""Grocery store"" to find out that they don’t sell clothing our size! Who wants to spend their 1st day like this? Spent 3 days in the same clothes that we came in. We finally received our bags 3 days later and we were only traveling for 4 full days. How does the jetblue agent working there who wrote out clearly where the bag was to be delivered had sent it to the wrong resort. They only way we found this out was to take another $80 taxi trip back to the airport to try to receive our bags ourselves. Got to the office spoke to a Dominican woman who had no ideas where our bag was, after hours wasted of precious vacation time we found out that they sent it clear across the island. Mind you I had a small child who was losing her patience thru all this mess. Moving now to our experience with jetblue counter in punta Cana . they made us take 19 lbs of luggage out our bag or pay $175 extra dollars, how is it that the same bag came from sfo with no extra charges we had our vacation luggage for 1 day and now you want to charge me that much to bring it back? Get the hell out. I’m so disgusted with Jetblue I will never ever refer anyone to this airline ever, even on arrival In jet blue knowing that the custom line is over 2 hrs long and we had a connection within an hour from gate to gate, they made us rush all the way thru customs and thru security with a very very rude staff thru TSA.",-1

It took off when my business meeting in Miami started; I stayed at JFK, got a room and attended the meeting by Zoom. Why did JetBlue allow me to board? The ""Ask JetBlue"" desk was useless in helping with my 12 hour layover. I paid for everything. TO make sure JetBlue did not cancel my JFK to BTV return I paid to upgrade my seat, to make sure I had a seat. The ""AskJetBlue"" guy kept insisting that he did me a favor by upgrading my seat...the one I already paid for. Forget trying to call JetBlue (800-JETBLUE) I have never had less than a 200 minute wait time. Customer service sent an email apologizing an saying they will issue a travel credit within 7 days; it's been 10 days, no credit and I can't get into the JetBlue Travel Bank without them authorizing it first. They suggest if there are problems just call 800-JETBLUE. Surprise! The wait time is 200 minutes. This is not an accident this is JetBlue's business model. Never fly JetBlue except for nonstops.",-1

We watched as the plane was being unloaded from the previous flight and grossly mishandled. We watched as the carts with luggage to be loaded pulled up and was parked to the side. Individuals stood around not loading Althea plane and eventually left. We were finally allowed to board the plane. Before we got on the plane we told the gentleman at the gate that no luggage had been loaded. He laughed at my husband and myself and told us not to worry about it. We were one of the last to board the plane. It wasn’t until everyone had board that they decided to load the luggage. We finally left after 4:00, the flight was supposed to leave at 2:59. Got to Atlanta and received an email that my bags did not make it on the plane and may or may not be here tomorrow morning! Don’t even want to talk about the service we received for the JetBlue employees in Atlanta. Rude, disrespectful, and no help at all!",-1
2021-08-13,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Terrible experience!,True,"  Terrible experience! I booked a flight for me and 5 family members from Ft Lauderdale to Las vegas, 10 minutes before boarding they canceled the flight! When we did ask for assistance at the counter, they told us that the flight was canceled because shortage of staff! Spending at least an 2 hours in line, had a representative trying to resolve the issue. Took more then one hour for her to switch our flight to an American airline at 7.45 am the next day … to find out in the morning that they have no reservation record. Next day , I went back and forward from Jetblue counter to American Airline for more than one hour, untill I asked jetblue officer to come with me and resolve the reservation . Stranded for a day and a half at the airport , mind you booked hotel and transportation, no one from Jet Blue, have tried to help us out. Now, trying to check in into a flight back home thru mobile, no luck! Thank Jet Blue for stealing a whole day of my paid vacation and a stress, never expected from this airline! Such a shame!",-1
2021-08-12,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to New York,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1,JetBlue have become the worse,False,"  July 4, 2021 my daughter that's 10 years old was schedule to flight around 3:45pm she was traveling with my cousin at the time, Around 3 clock they mention the fight was going to be delayed. Making the story short she board two plane while waiting and in her second plane after she was waiting from 1am to 3am they decided to cancel her flight. I got furious with JetBlue they didn't offer food or even a drink. After all they gave her a 200$ credit and I decided to give it another try and used the credit big mistake today 08/11/21 we flow back from PR back to NYC. Our fight got delayed and we landed at 9:45pm due to the volume of planes we been waiting inside the plane for over 1 hr after landing. Please people avoid JetBlue they have become the worse.",-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bermuda,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1, Horrible experience with this airline,True,"  We were scheduled to leave on Bermuda flight 1731 from JFK at 11:00 a.m. 8/11/21. We had applied for travel authorization but never received it from the Government of Bermuda. We had emailed them with no response. We were at the gate checked in TSA precheck with about 45 minutes to board when we were informed we would not be able to board the plane without our travel authorization forms. I called the Bermuda government hotline immediately. We told the jetblue attendant at the gate immediately. She was rude and zero help; ""Without the form I am not letting you on the plane sir"". I was put on hold with the clock ticking from the Bermuda government. We asked them to hold the flight they would not. We were told by the Bermuda government we already received approval yesterday but the email did not go through. They resent it. We got it at 10:49. They could care less. We missed our flight, a day of our vacation, thousands of dollars, for 2-5 minutes, that was the mistake of the Bermuda Health Department? And zero help or compassion from JetBlue. Horrible experience with this airline.",-1

This is no longer the case given the current state of their customer (no) service. I booked a flight for my wife and me that was subsequently was changed by the airline. When prompted to confirm the new itinerary options the JetBlue website directed me to call 1-800-JETBLUE. Upon calling I was informed to take my inquiry to the JetBlue website or hold for 221 minutes - that's right, hold for over 3.5 hours or go back to the website that couldn't help me and directed me to call in the first place. I waited on hold for 3 hours and 29 minutes to have a 5-minute conversation where I was told my new flight would now depart at 5:20 am. After finding a better flight option on another airline I went to cancel my itinerary on the JetBlue website. Again I was told that JetBlue was ""unable to process my request"" and to call 1-800-JetBlue. After trying several times online over a 3 day period I was given no option but to call their customer (no) service again. This time I was told the wait would be 201 minutes. Fortunately my home airport (Boston Logan) has many options and I expect Delta and American will be my new go to airlines.",-1
2021-08-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kingston Jamaica to New York,3.0,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,There appears to be no quality standard,False,  I have been flying Jet Blue to and from New York from Jamaica for the past 8 years or so for company annual leave travel. The experience is that though I am a paying customer I am an inconvenience to the crew. They constantly wear a frown/scowl as a badge of honor. Smiling is not a crime and should be a part of the uniform. The lavatories are filthy from boarding commencement. There appears to be no quality standard in this area of their service. The passenger announcements are garbled from the cockpit with very little relevant information being passed as it’s just a tick in the box exercise for the flight crew. The cabin crew on the other hand need to speak a little softer or issue earplugs before their PA and should refrain from talking down to their customers. The worst flying experience consistently is to be their award. Any effort to treat all onboard with respect will be a positive step.,-1
2021-08-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Boston,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2,I am so dissatisfied,False,"  I would not recommend flying Jet Blue to anyone after the experience I had today with their airline. I think the only good thing I can say about them is that their employees on the plane are nice. But besides that, I’ve had two delays just today. I got to Miami airport before 6am, it is 6pm and I am still on a plane, currently delayed, and we have been stopped at a random airport for 40+ minutes, and I am still not back home to Ma which is a 3hr flight. This will likely be the last time I fly JetBlue. I am so dissatisfied with my entire JetBlue experience today.",-1
2021-08-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,This is the new Spirit,False,"  I fly frequently with Delta. Decided to go with JetBlue for the first time and what an awful experience. They cancelled my flight, put me in a hotel, allowed standbys on their flights the next following days before me (a paying customer). Absolutely ridiculous. The wait time for customer service was 4 hours. The person on the chat blocked me out so I couldn’t ask further questions. The worst airline. This is the new Spirit. On my flight to PUJ the TV didn’t even work. Worst experience. I absolutely hate JetBlue. Wasted my time. Feels like I wasted my money.",-1

Start with customer service. When dialed, waiting time was 372 minutes and there’s no option for Jetblue to call call. So the customer either opts for leaving the phone waiting for more than 6 hours or forget your reimbursement. That goes to my second complaint. You pay for luggage up front but if you pay for more luggage than what you decided to finally take, the only option to hope and get a reimbursement is calling customer service. This airline is led by a bunch of bandits - charge the customer and make it almost impossible to request a reimbursement. JetBlue, not that you care, but you lost a family of 5 and I’ll do as much negative publicity as I can.",-1
2021-08-07,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rhode Island to Orlando,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3,flight times were changed multiple times,False,"  Horrible experience. Our flight times were changed multiple times from the time we originally booked the flight in March, and then on the day of our flight; it was delayed again for a few hours. So one of our vacation days were spent in the airport waiting for our plane to get there. We were supposed to be in Orlando at 5:30pm that day; but we didn’t get there until 1:30 the next morning. And then when we get to the airport to go back home It was the same exact thing .. delay after delay. The JetBlue employees were nice; but the Airline needs to do better with the Arrival and departure times.",-1
2021-08-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to San Juan,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Truly a horrible experience all around,True," Horrible experience, my flight was cancelled due to pilots timing out and I reviewed an email 4 hrs before I was supposed to flight out. I was traveling from NY to PR and my outgoing flight was cancelled on a Thursday morning and they “auto” rescheduled me for a Saturday morning flight, meanwhile I was only staying til Sunday. I had to go to the airport, stand in a 3 hour line, and fight to get on another flight leaving sooner. My flight was one of 5-6 flights that had all been cancelled for bad weather that never actually came. The option they gave me landed at a different airport 2 and a half hours away from the Airbnb I was staying at. I had to other make arrangements due to no rental cars. After spending the rest of my cut short trip I was emailed about my returning flight that had been delayed 4 times. My original take off time was 1.45 pm and I didn’t get into my seat on the plane until about 6pm that night. Called customer service multiple times only to get hung up on after being on hold for hours on end to just speak to someone. Truly a horrible experience all around and I would not recommend flying with JetBlue anytime soon.",-1
2021-08-07,0.2,Business,Economy Class,,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,couple of big problems with JetBlue,False,"  A couple of big problems with JetBlue: Hold time if you call. First time in my life I have heard “you have a wait time of 400 minutes.” 400 minutes? Gives a great starting example of the customer service to follow. JetBlue partners with Qatar Airways. Sounds great as Qatar is one of my favorite airlines. Here’s the issue: JetBlue will not let you select a seat or allow you to upgrade. Even for $$$$. They say “the flight is a co-share and operated by another so you have to do any seat selection or upgrades through the carrier.” Great. Not a problem, except there is a problem because JetBlue has it set up with Qatar where you can’t use your confirmation code on the Qatar Airways website so you are effectively in purgatory. Neither can help you!  And I always pay for a Y fare which allows any and all changes. So imagine that - you pay for a Y fare which is the most flexible fare available and JetBlue screws you out of the option to make any changes.",-1
2021-08-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Miami,,,,,,,1,cannot get them on the phone,False,"  You cannot get them on the phone. Anytime of day or night, they have a 3+ hour wait to talk to anyone! My son's flight was delayed leaving. Once at his destination, we got a call of a family medical emergency and he needed to get home. Unable to reach them via phone, we attempted to get a flight online. Nothing for that day, so he drove up from Fl. to NY. with a family member. Then there was no option to cancel his flight, only change it. I am now forces to call them and cannot get through. It is 1am now. I've been on hold since 7:15pm. After almost 3hrs, they picked up and disconnected me! I immediately called back and was told it was a 189 minute wait time.   There is no way it should ever take this long to get through to any business, especially one with time sensitive issues.",-1
2021-08-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to New York JFK,3.0,5.0,5.0,,2.0,5.0,2,the plane itself was disgusting,True,"  It is a shame that I even have to write this review because this is usually my airline of choice. Before I continue with my review I want to clarify that the flight attendants and pilot were awesome. They made me feel completely at ease and comfortable for the entire flight. However, the plane itself was disgusting. I mean I could not wait to get home and shower bc I felt like I was sitting in pure dirt. The crevasse between my seat was filled with crushed up cheese its. The sealing of the plane and my window had brown marks on them. Lastly, there was some type of particles that kept falling from the air vents all flight. I checked to see the cleanliness of the vents and they were covered in dust. I felt absolutely disgusting and could not fall asleep like I normally would on this quick flight because I was so grossed out. They announced that this flight was thoroughly cleaned right before we entered for ""covid regulations"" but I can tell by the aircraft's condition it was a lie. Not to mention the passengers who were on this plane previously literally disembarked less than 10 minutes ago. There is no way that an airline should allow passengers on an aircraft in that condition. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Puerto Rico,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Awful experience both times,False,"  Awful experience both times I traveled with Jet Blue. The first travel we had more than five hours delayed without any reason for the staff (not present nor on line). Now in return the same thing. They are more than 2 hours delay, inside the plane and the air condition isn’t working. So disappointed.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to New York,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,Jet Blue cheated us,False,"  My husband and I paid $6,000 for two round-trip Mint (Business Class) tickets between Los Angeles and New York. Upon our return, we were informed that Jet Blue had switched out our plane (they used it in a more advantageous market - probably international) and no Mint service would be available on our ""replacement"" flight. The flight was delayed for 90 minutes and our $1,500 one way return tickets - for a total of $3,000 for two people, were refunded for only $500 each! Another words, Jet Blue cheated us by charging $1,000 each for one-way Coach - no food, tiny seat, no customer service! Do not fly Jet Blue if you can help it. They are no longer anywhere near a top airline. Also, their Mint service can be disappeared on a whim.",-1
2021-08-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Raleigh,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely zero military accommodation,False,"  Absolutely zero military accommodation.

2021-08-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York-JFK to San Jose,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have ever experienced,False,"  Jetblue is definitely the worst airline that I have ever experienced. They canceled our nonstop flight two hours before the departure when we were at the airport. No one, neither the manager nor the customer service, was responsive at the airport. In fact they were extremely rude and deliberately ignored us and our questions about the cancellation reason and potential replacement flights. They didn’t answer to our questions about reimbursement and compensation and we had to pay for an extra night at a hotel and multiple uber rides. They finally booked us a 20 hour connecting flight. Please please don’t travel with this airline, they’re awful.",-1
2021-08-01,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Las Vegas,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1,Very slow and uninformed staff attention,True," LAMENTABLE, los atrasos y cancelaciones sin ningún tipo de aviso y sin importarles el tiempo de los pasajeros hacen de esta aerolínea una vergüenza. La atención del personal muy lenta y desinformada. Es increíble que sigan volando con semejante mal servicio. UNFORTUNATELY, the delays and cancellations without any kind of notice and without caring about the time of the passengers make this airline a disgrace. Very slow and uninformed staff attention. It's incredible that they keep flying with such bad service",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Puerto Rico,3.0,,5.0,,,3.0,3,they made us miss our flight,False,"  The worst experience with this airline. We made it to the airport an hour before our flight. We got to the baggage check in on time and the rep said we got there just in time because in 5-10 minutes the baggage check in would be closed. While she was midway into checking our bags in, her manager from behind a different stand asked if anyone was travelling to Puerto Rico. Our rep said we were. The supervisor said - nope, it’s too late for them to check in the luggage. What? We are already being checked in, with 10 minutes in reserve, and suddenly are being told we are late? We said if you finish checking us in, we’ll make it as there was close to an hour before the flight. Our rep now turned completely unfriendly and said we wouldn’t make it anyway because the security line is long. How is it her business how fast we go through the security line? We said finish processing the bags and we will ask someone at the security check to let us go ahead if she is that worried about the line. She said Nope. Take your bags, we can’t assist you. So they made us miss our flight. Awful! Never again with this airline.",-1
2021-08-01,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Cape Cod,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,5.0,2,Non-existent customer service,True,"  Non-existent customer service. Called 3 times. Told wait time was 220, 194 and 510 minutes. 3 flights within 3 weeks. All were late. One almost 4 hours. No notice before arrival at airport. Gate change on airport departure board but gate attendant kept saying it was at original gate. When I mentioned the discrepancy she said to trust the airport board as the gate rarely got current updates. Website frequently froze; couldn’t get boarding pass from app. Flight from JFK to SeaTac rescheduled 40 minutes earlier than ticket but received no notification of change. Didn’t find out about the change until I checked in, which fortunately was the day before so I could change my limo to the airport. Wi-Fi and TV not working on cross country flight. Overall these were the three worst flights I have ever been on and I travel pretty regularly. Thought I might save some money this time on the cross country flight, but Jetblue proves the adage that you get what you pay for. Wouldn’t fly JetBlue again if they were the only airline in the world.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Miami,1.0,,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly JetBlue ever again,False,"  I will never fly JetBlue ever again. I’ve now flown with this airline 3 times and each time I’ve been delayed. I only ever have this problem with this airline. Horrible customer service as well. Asked for water, and nope. As I’m sitting here in the plane for 2 hours on a delay.",-1
2021-07-31,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Burbank,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2,an overall poor experience,True," Probably won't fly JetBlue again. Flight was delayed one hour which I understand. Then the plane couldn't back up because there was an issue disconnecting the push bar from the plane, evidently a common problem. Once we were taxiing out we had to wait another 30 minutes due to a brake heat sensor malfunction. There had to be clearance paperwork processed for us to leave. Once in the air they ran out of the snack boxes 1/3 of the way through the plane. Poor planning. Just an overall poor experience.",-1
2021-07-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Boise,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,absolutely atrocious experience,True,"  This was an absolutely atrocious experience. The flight was delayed for over two hours. Instead of allowing passengers to wait in the airport, we were all stuck sitting in the  airplane seats the entire time. They apparently couldn’t get ahold of the push crew necessary for the plane to leave the gate. Not even an issue with the plane itself or the runway or the weather, simply human incompetence. I wouldn’t recommend to my worst enemy.",-1
2021-07-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to New York,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,a bad experience from Jetblue,True,"  On 28th July, my flight was from MCO to JFK (Flight 2884) at 4:15pm, but it was delayed due to weather conditions and I wasn’t able to make a connection flight via Qatar Airways (JFK to Doha on 8:55pm). So, they requested me to go Just Ask Counter and seek for help, they changed my flight from Qatar to Etihad Airways, and tell me to wait for the next day night time 21:05pm to Abu Dhabi. They only provided me a $16 voucher for foods, so i have been staying inside the airport for 18hrs just to board on the flight. Before that, I asked the girl who changed my flight in JetBlue just ask counter, they said my they couldn’t track my baggage as per told by their baggage management, and told me to call Qatar hotline. I did it in the next day, they said I have to ask the Qatar counter on JFK, end up Qatar told me it JetBlue hasn’t confirmed my flight via Etihad to Abu Dhabi, they don't know where is my baggage. I have been running back and forth form terminal 4 to 5 and back to 8, just because JetBlue haven’t confirmed my ticket on Etihad Airways .Now, I reached Malaysia i still haven’t get any notifications about my baggage. I just have a bad experience from Jetblue who didn’t care about their customers.",-1

2021-07-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to New York,2.0,,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1,No compensation for the inconvenience,True,  Horrible customer service! You can not reach an agent at all. First they provided us with the wrong information that we had to pay for our carry on (6 bags for 6 travelers) so we did online. When we approached the airport we find out we don't have to pay for carry-ons. Now we have to fight for a refund. Agents and supervisor that I had the pleasure to speak with were unpleasant and rude! On the phone you are going to be on hold for hours. In my case it was 9hours and I couldn't reach anyone. When finally someone answered they connected me 3 times from one dept to another! No compensation for the inconvenience. If you can stay away!,-1
2021-07-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Albuquerque via New York,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1,I am beyond furious,True,"  I flew my family of 5 and my mother (6 total) to Puerto Rico June 28th - July 10th. Prior to leaving I get notification my mother has been removed front the flight home and rescheduled a day earlier. So 2 days before leaving I am scrambling to reschedule the other 5 tickets with JetBlue so we can travel tougher. So now we are leaving a day early on July 9th instead. On the 9th we get to the Airport to return to Albuquerque from Puerto Rico. We are told our flight is delayed 3 hours and will miss our reconnecting flight in New York. After being in line and taking with the reps for 2 hours we are told the only flight from NY to ABQ for us is on July 14th. We are told there is nothing they can do for us in Puerto Rico and must fly to NY to see what they can do there. They cancel our reconnecting flight as we are not going to be there in time and rebook it for the 14th. So now I have my family on a flight to NY not knowing what we are supposed to do when we get there. We land in NY and go to the JetBlue counter. The lady says they have no rooms available and cannot rent us a car to drive home but will call her manager. The manager walks up saying “Stick to your guns, No, No, No” before even looking at our file on the screen and what’s happening. We again are told there is nothing they can do for us. I have myself, my wife, 3 kids and my mother in the airport being told we have nowhere to stay and cannot get a flight for 5 days. We frantically start calling my wife’s aunt who lives in NY but are unable to get ahold of them. The Manager says the only thing he can do is get us a Lyft to their house. We explained we haven’t gotten ahold of anyone but with nothing else to do we accept. They then get us a Lyft that is too small! After begging the driver to take us as it’s now 12am and we have been in lines for 3 hours at NY JetBlue customer service he allows us to pile in and place luggage all over our laps. We’re taking to my wife’s Aunts apartment and dropped off in front of a locked door as a sign that says “Doorman will be back in 5 min is posted”. So now my family is standing outside a locked door in NY in the rain.  The doorman let’s us in and says we can’t stay there without permission. So again, here we are being thrown out on the streets of NY by JetBlu. Thank God after about 30min we were able to get permission to go in as they are out of town but the doorman has spare keys. I am simply hoping our flight on the 14th goes through now! To add insult I got an email today from JetBlue they are sorry for the travel issues and have given a credit of $50. That’s $8.33 for each of us to enjoy another JetBlue flight experience! I am beyond furious.",-1
2021-07-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to New York via Boston,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,1.0,1,communications are a disaster,False,"  Flights were okay, but systems and communications are a disaster. Nothing works, on line, by phone, or in airports. Customer inconvenience seems to be their top priority. Customer service phone lines announced wait times of 200 - 300 minutes. Could not check in on line or at airport kiosks. Confirmation numbers not accepted. Had to wait in long lines to check in; desks inadequately staffed. Seat assignments not honored. Also, checked bags lost - one for 1 day, one for 6 days; required daily calls (with 30-60 minute wait times) to check status (on line system not updated with new information). Central baggage staff pleasant and helpful.",-1
2021-07-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to new York,,,,,,,1,the worst customer service,False,"  I had a round trip ticket between SEA and JFK. The evening before my return flight (July 22) I received an email that the flight was to be delayed five hours. The following morning, I received three email within twelve minutes. One said that flight was delayed, one said it was cancelled, and the third said that it was postponed until the following day. I tried to call customer service but was given wait times of five to six hours. I then found a number on their website 1-802-219-8701, and a person answered, and told me that the flight was on schedule. I then looked at the website, and saw that it was indeed cancelled until the following day. I called the number again for clarification, and was then told that not only was it cancelled, but that it may not go out the next day either. I looked for other flights, and was able to get out on Alaska Airlines that day. I was unable to cancel my JetBlue ticket online, because on such short notice, it must be done through Customer Service, which still had five to six hour wait times. I went ahead and flew home on Alaska, hoping that I could get a refund for my return ticket. When I was still unable to reach Customer Service, I called the 802 number that I had been able to reach the previous day. I learned from the man that answered the phone that they are not JetBlue, but only contract with them, and the $125 change fee was for their service. I tried to call JetBlue numerous times since I have been home, and there is always a five to six hour hold time. I read that there is a live chat on their mobile app, where you can chat with a real person. I tried that, and got a message that nobody is available to respond. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced anywhere. I will avoid this airline at all cost.",-1
2021-07-26,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to New York,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,has been one of the worst flights,True," This has been one of the worst flights I have ever been on. Should have paid extra money for delta or American airlines. My flight was from San Juan to New York JFK - originally 5pm, 2 hour delay because they could not find pilot. After start of board process when they finally found the pilot took another half hour to get the plane ready when they could have done that during the 2 hour. The seats don't move very tight, ac did not work. TV did not work, wifi did not work. We land and another 45 minutes waiting for jetblue to empty suitcases into compartment. Spend the extra money on other airlines, there's a reason why jetblue is so cheap compared to other airlines. Maybe they didn't have enough staff? Jet blue staff also looked miserable working there",-1

On occasion I get assigned to other shipyards around the country for temporary projects. I was given advanced notice by my superiors about a upcoming trip to San Diego shipyard. I was instructed to arrange my itinerary for July 6th, 2021. Because I planned on bringing my family I had to book my own flight out of pocket. So on Friday June 25th, 2021 I opted to join Jet Blue's ""True Blue"" program. When selecting my fare I specifically selected the Blue package and added insurance for both seats and upgraded to ""even more"" seats. Also reserved a spot under my seat for a cat. The grand total was $1,139. Fast forward to Tuesday June 29th, 2021. I received a notice from my supervisor that everyone in my shop who was suppose to fly out on July 6th gad their trip postponed effective immediately. I called to verify the bad news. Then I immediately went onto JetBlue and logged in and canceled my itinerary. I has the understanding that since I opted to pay extra for the insurance and other extras that my flight expenses would be covered if I canceled. I did after all plan for this trip for a month in advance. Took a whole paycheck and then some to make this happen. I'm not rich. To me a grand is a hefty sum of money. Not something I can afford to dish out at flick of a finger. So after I canceled my itinerary I received a few very confusing emails informing me how I may or may not receive a refund depending on if my flight was refundable or not. At this point I had no idea how to tell if my flight was or was not refunded. I never saw any disclaimer or big print warning me about purchasing a none refundable ticket. I was then informed by email that $830.80 would be refunded but only in the form of a Jetblue travel credit. I had an anxiety attack at this point. So I decided to give JetBlue a call. Had to wait for 2 hours and 52 minutes just to get ahold of a rude women. She lectured me on how it's my fault because I purchased a nonrefundable ticket and went on about how great travel credit is. I pleaded with her to do something so I could get my money back. She pretty much said I'm not getting it back. I did some research online. Transportation.gov. They pretty much side with the airlines and they determine that if you had to cancel your flight (regardless of the reasons) then your not entitled to a refund in the form of money. So it seems I'm screwed. We are screwed. The government backs the airlines. The airlines will keep my $1,139.80 and they will sell the seats to someone else and make double the profit. Unbelievable. I feel hopeless. The shipyard can't do anything for me even though they are the ones who postponed our trip. It's not fair.  I won't be on the flight and I canceled a week in advance. I paid for insurance which obviously is useless and there is no clear disclaimer about buying nonrefundable tickets",-1
2021-07-25,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Washington,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,not going to fly with them again,False,  Last night was chaos! Flight got delayed 3 times and the gates changed multiple times like half an hour before the flight time. Each passenger on their own. Like they don't announce the changes on the gate screen. There was a lot of passengers really upset about that. Kids got frustrated and crying. When you reach the gate you barely understand what the attendance are saying. No lines . No organization. The ticket cost me a lot but it was an emergency flight so I kind of had no choice but to go with them. But definitely not going to fly with them again.,-1
2021-07-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,we would need to purchase new tickets,True," My wife and I were flying from PDX to Cabo San Lucus, July 7, 2021 via Alaska Airlines. Alaska canceled the leg from LAX to Cabo, but booked my wife, myself, and two other couples onto a Jetblue flight for the same connection, and we were given boarding passes straight through. When we got to the gate the flight was already boarding. The other two couples showed the boarding passes and got right on. We were told that they could see our names on the manifest, but that we would need to purchase new tickets to get onto the plane. We called Alaska, we spoke with Jetblue, to no avail. So we handed over a cc and bought new tickets. After our trip, we contacted Alaska, who provided us with confirmation numbers showing they had paid Jetblue for our passage. They sent us to Jetblue to get a refund for the extra tickets Jetblue required us to purchase. First, if you call Jetblue (I dare you 1 (800) 538-2583), you will hear that your wait time is estimated at well over 300 minutes. Tough it out, we did, only that person can't help you and gives you a second number (1-801-449-2580) to call and wait on hold for hours for the next level of support. Only that person, though friendly, can't help you either, so you wait while they wait on hold for a supervisor (add another 30 minutes). In the end, we got on the plane so Jetblue says we used the tickets, and even though they have been paid twice for the same passage, they cannot speak with our connect consumers to anyone in accounting that can verify the double payment. 4+ hours on the phone later.",-1
2021-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to New York,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2,No soul in the company at all,False,  They put me and my 2 under age kids in separate seats. Both whom have anxiety disorders and this was our return flight from laying my dad's ashes to rest in his home town. And not a care was given to our situation all they offered was for me to pay an additional fee to sit together. No soul in the company at all.,-1
2021-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Santiago Dominican Republic,,,,,,1.0,1,service was horrendous inefficient,True,"  It was a long waited vacation for my wife, my kids and I. We were going to see some family but we also booked a Hotel resort. My flight was at 5:00 AM, I arrived at 1:45 AM at the airport. At the terminal it was chaotic it was over crowded there was no clear line and no information where to check in. So as I was checking in at the Kiosk I asked one Jetblue worker to help me because I was having trouble checking in. He was very rude and said that he wasn’t there for that. After wasting over 40 minutes trying to check in. I asked another JetBlue employee and she sent to check-in counter. It was a very long line at the check counter. There were 8 counters working but very slow. I end up losing my flight by waiting in line and just like me there was hundreds other that this same thing happened to them. I asked to speak with a supervisor. I explained my situation and there was still an hour left for my flight. The supervisor told me that all he can do was to rebook and sent me to the other side of the terminal to rebook my flight. The line was a very long line I ended up spending two hours in the before I could see someone. As I explained to them that I needed the next available flight they told me that their next available flight was two day later. I tried to explain to them that I have already booked a hotel resort and it was not refundable. I spoke with the counter clerk she had an attitude as she was mad already. She did not want to listen to my problem. I asked to speak to a supervisor and spoke again with Sean. He was very again and didn’t care about me or my family. Their service was horrendous inefficient and unprofessional. I would never fly again with JetBlue. They are the worst",-1
2021-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Jacksonville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I feel completely traumatized from this experience,True," Jetblue is the absolute worst! They left a toddler homeless at LAX because they rejected an emotional support animal and wouldn‘t let us board. No lyfts or Ubers in site because there was a shortage from so many people trying to call them at once. Other customers that were left stranded. I literally had to walk in the dark with 2 year old on the highway to get shelter at a nearby hotel which I paid for. They wouldn’t even refund the tickets or baggage, they just offered 'credit' towards another flight. I feel completely traumatized from this experience.",-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will definitely choose another airline for my next flight,False,"  Woke up this morning, ready to return home. I received a short curt email stating that my flight has been canceled and stated that they will update me shortly. They never did send any updates. Had to call Jetblue customer service. The only thing they offered was a redeye flight or a refund. I had to book on another airline at almost double the cost because, it was a same-day reservation. I will definitely choose another airline for my next flight.",-1
2021-07-19,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Hyannis,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3,"No explanation, no compensation, no apologies",False,"  What a joke of service. Flight schedule 10 am. Delayed which happen, so inconvenient but ok. Problem is passengers got 3 different answers from airline. Gate person said flight was on time as shown on ticket. Departure board showed different gate and 3 hr delay. Two emails showed yet another departure time and that the one hr flight would take 23 hours. Not sure how many departments with incompetent people were involved but whole business has been a joke! No explanation, no compensation, no apologies. Jetblue has a lot to learn about customer service.",-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to New York,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,both trips were severely delayed,True," My trip was scheduled from from July 10th to July 19th, both those trips were severely delayed with no compensation, in fact this is the 3rd time I'm flying with Jetblue and every time there has been a severe delay. I will never fly with this airline again.",-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Seattle,,,,,,1.0,1,automated phone call informing us the flight is canceled,True,"  Two hours before our flight back from NYC to Seattle, we received an automated phone call informing us the flight is canceled. Instead of flying on Sunday at 6 pm, we were offered to fly on Tuesday at 7 am. This new flight now has a layover: NY to FL to WA, adding extra 4 hours of trip. Online customer service could not provide any assistance with getting a hotel or food for the extra days we have to stay in New York. They referred us to the airport instead. Why was my flight cancelled? First it was because of weather conditions, and then because there were not enough people, and now it's because if no crew. When we arrived at the airport, we were redirected from the front desk to baggage service to get help with the hotel. There was a crowd of people waiting for the same thing and only two people assisting them. The time was 6:15 pm. Forty minutes later, we got our contact information collected, asked to wait for a phone call... 9:54 pm - we are still waiting. Other people from the crowd stated they also never received any call. Walking back to baggage service, we find customer service people now being rude. We are still trying to get any help. Customer service people, now saying the hotel may not even happen.",-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Newark,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Flight kept being delayed,True,"  Flight kept being delayed over and over; provided voucher for food with only option available in the terminal being a dry pork chop; extremely poor customer service; compensation is given on airline credit which forces customers to book again with this airline. In the end, what seemed a cheap flight turned to be a costly decision that I will never, ever, make again. Delays with this airline are quite common, so this is the last time I make the mistake of flying with JetBlue.",-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,flights are routinely delayed,True,  First and last time flying with JetBlue. Delays on both of my flights and not even an attempt at making it up from customer service. I have a busy schedule and cannot afford it when flights are routinely delayed and customers are treated with terrible service. Will be advising my friends to avoid the headaches and unreliable service provided by JetBlue.,-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston MA to Pheonix AZ,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I never even got on the darn plane!,True," Nightmare! After getting there in plenty if time, my grandson and I missed our flight after standing in line that no one was moving along, clusters of people waiting on one suitcase, time passing. Drive me nuts! Only to be told we missed our flight and no one cared! Like oh well, no more flights today. You will have to come back tomorrow. What? Employees were walking around, not a care in the world. Not expediting anyone or asking anyone ""anything"". I asked for help and the employee pointed to a line that I was already standing in! They scanned our boarding passes, knew we were there, still waiting in that long line and did nothing. TSA was no better. A suitcase was pulled aside, but no one was there to check it, so we all stood there and waited and waited and waited! Now we were backing up the line at both ends. Our flight was to leave at 7 am, we arrived at 5 am. They did give us tickets for tomorrow, same flight. We are going to arrive at 3 am for a 7am flight! Worst flying experience of my life and I never even got on the darn plane!",-1
2021-07-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Jacksonville,,,,,,1.0,1,Terrible customer service,True,"  Arrived early as instructed only to be met with a unusually long check in line, outside, where 2 men couldn't handle the amount of ppl hence missing my flight, after 2 hours on a line waiting for supervisor, & then I'm told that there's absolutely no other flights to fla today. I'm now booked on a flight tomorrow on a connection flight leaving jfk at 430 pm arriving at Jacksonville at 11 pm, now I have to get ride, go back to port jefferson station, get another ride on a work day for most & will lose 2 days of my vacation! Also every employee had the worst attitudes! Terrible customer service, twice this week I waited over 3 hours on hold without ever getting someone to even pick up the phone! Always used jet blue but this isn't the first time my plans came undone to no fault of my own, if you don't have enough staff to accommodate your customers you shouldn't be selling tickets to ppl who will get to the airport only to be sent home. 100s of ppl were on the line with me as well, all with the same issues although for different flights! Never again!",-1
2021-07-18,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,delayed my flight 7 hours,True,  They delayed my flight 7 hours which cost me to miss my flight from Miami to Lima. They refused to send me to a hotel. They gave me $48 for dinner for my family. In Boston where everything is expensive.,-1
2021-07-17,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Sacramento,4.0,2.0,1.0,,5.0,5.0,4,My flight was a nightmare,False,"  My flight was a nightmare. There were a total of 4 flight attendants, and one of them made this flight a complete chaos! We travelled on July 15th, flight #161 JFK - SAC. A flight attendant kept bugging customers on the plane about different things like your bag in not far enough under the seat, or move your sweater off your lap because I need to see the seatbelt. These things don’t sound as something outside of normal, but when you are bugged every 10 minutes about it it just get to you. Also about masks, she repeated her self at least 100 times throughout the flight, which was 5hrs 45mins long, so even if you tried sleeping/resting you wouldn’t be able to do so. We flew with JetBlue before and during the peak of COVID, but the masks were never that big of an issue to be constantly repeated over and over again. She kept on repeating that you can’t have your mask down and your face has to be covered and that when you bought a ticket with JetBlue you agreed to it and threatening that if people put their masks down there will be police waiting for them at the gate when we land, and that is actually what happened to some people as we landed and started deplaning. The tone in which she was saying these things was rude and demanding, she was not polite. Personally for me, as well as for many other people I’m sure, this made this flight a total nightmare. Also, when we travelled SAC - JFK - PUJ, and PUJ - JFK - SAC, the flights we’re always late but at least an hour. When traveling from PUJ - JFK - SAC, we almost missed our flight from JFK to SAC because the previous flight PUJ - JFK was late.",-1
2021-07-16,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Los Angeles,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2,horrible customer service,False,"  This was not the experience I was looking for at all. On the way to JFK, we were repeatedly delayed and eventually cancelled around midnight. They kept telling everyone that staff was on the way but staff wasn’t there. The employees were not helpful at all and did not honor any of our pre paid upgrades until we brought a supervisor in. Lines coming back from JFK were horrible and the staff was no help. The actual flight itself was nice, the crew especially on the flight to JFK were super nice and kept apologizing to those of us who were supposed to fly out the day before. Overall, would not do this again due to the horrible customer service.",-1
2021-07-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Albuquerque,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,had multiple delays on both legs,True,"  First and last time we will be flying JetBlue. My daughter and I took JetBlue to Albuquerque to New York and then took them back. Unfortunately, we had multiple delays on both legs of the flight and were 1-3 hrs delayed both ways. Once the delays began, I started looking at reviews and appears this is quite common with JetBlue. I would ensure you don’t use this airline if you have connecting flights and it was quite frustrating either way as planes were fully booked and we were squished, hot, and delayed. I would rather pay the extra money and have a smooth flight. On a positive, I was thankful for each seat having a tv.",-1
2021-07-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Ft Lauderdale to Chicago,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,1,I cant even bring a carry-on,True,"  I am not sure what has happened to Jetblue. If you call their phone support, there is a 190+ mins wait. Now they have removed basic flights and made some BS blue basic. A ticket to NYC used to cost what their basic blue costs now, except now, I cant even bring a carry-on. They say it's to be more competitive with Spirit, I think the whole company is shifting towards that goal. It's becoming nothing that is expensive. What used to be a go-to for all travelers wanting a standard of flight has fallen to the wayside to cut costs. No longer are passengers the number one priority, it is the money. And what's more, these airlines have been given so much taxpayer money and continue to price out their customers. Jetblue received 900+ million dollars last year from the government and for some reason, raised their prices and lowered their standard. I am not sure what internal leadership has decided, but its not good. FYI, still on hold.",-1
2021-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Palm Beach to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They would not honor the credit,False,"  The flight took place in March 2020, right before the pandemic. Waited on the tarmac for two hours with two children under 3. JetBlue destroyed our brand new stroller luggage and compensated us with a $215 flight credit. We tried to book a flight this year but the $215 credit expired after 365 days. They would not honor the credit because we were a few weeks beyond the expiration date .. even though they weren't flying during a significant portion of 2020.",-1
2021-07-13,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,4.0,,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5,sent a very gracious apology email,False,"  Planned overlay at JFK 2.5 hrs, actual overlay 7.5 hrs. By the time I arrived home, JetBlue had sent a very gracious apology email thanking all the passengers, stating we would each receive a credit since our experience had not met our expectations of the service we anticipated and thanking us for our patience.",1
2021-07-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Raleigh,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst experience ever with an airline,True, Worst experience ever with an airline. Was suppose to board at 3.35 and the time kept getting pushed back until 7.30 when they told us our flight was canceled. Went to the help desk to find no one there. The lady who sold chargers directed me where to go after that. No accommodations or anything. I was literally stranded in NJ with no assistance. Flight was rescheduled to two days later. Couldn’t get in contact with anyone by message or phone. God awful service!,-1
2021-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Austin, TX to Newark, NJ",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,You can’t make this up,True,"  Awful. Used to be my preferred airline. We will never fly JetBlue again. The entire experience was a disaster and filled with lies and misinformation. By looking at other reviews, this appears to be their M.O. We were scheduled to depart around 1.47pm. They kept moving the departure time every hour or so, with no explanations. The staff were  embarrassed and didn’t know what to do. The original explanation was a mechanical issue. Then it became a failure of the exit sign to illuminate. Then the pilots show up. They say they’re ready to fly. Nope. Can’t. Supposedly again dude to exit light failing to light. They keep delaying, refusing to say “canceled”, to avoid having to compensate anyone. They say by FAA rules they cannot fly today. We are rescheduled for the next morning. Luckily we live nearby. We go home and show up again the next morning only to find that they never fixed the plane. Never attempted to fix the plane. Plane sat at the airport and they supposedly had to fly mechanics in the fix the plane, and decided to fly those mechanics in at 6am that morning. Truth? Who knows. Doesn’t make a lot of sense. Let the plane sit there for almost 24hrs and fly mechanics in from out of state two hours before departure time? Who knows. At this point they start delaying the new flight again. Hour by hour we’re told the issue is still not fixed and we can’t fly. Yet. But they’re careful not to call it canceled. Finally the pilots show up and they’re shocked to hear they can’t fly again. They leave. One comes back because he himself cannot believe what’s going on and decides to talk with passengers directly because no one at JetBlue is addressing the issue. He says he’s mortified by what’s going on and doesn’t understand why JetBlue didn’t address the problem with the plane, or fly another plane in to use, or why they didn’t decide to fly mechanics in until this morning, etc etc. He is embarrassed and says he doesn’t know what we’ve been told but the truth is the plane isn’t going to go anywhere anytime soon. It’s now 3pm that we’re sitting in the airport for a flight that was supposed to depart 1.47pm the day before. No sign of it leaving. We canceled. And get this - gate attendant says he understands and will get our bags off the plane. But he can’t right now because baggage handlers are on a union mandated break. You can’t make this up. So now they’re holding our baggage hostage. Amazing. We finally got our bags and canceled. We were former loyal JetBlue customers but will never use them again. Horrible experience in every aspect - the lack of information, the misinformation, the attitudes, the mess, and now they’re issuing credits instead of refund. As if I want to fly JetBlue again. If I don’t get my money refunded I will pay an attorney to handle the case to get money refunded. You can’t treat people like this.",-1
2021-07-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Punta Cana,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,experienced such terrible service,False,"  We have never experienced such terrible service. We have been stuck in Fort Lauderdale airport since 8 am and it is now 2 pm. We boarded the flight 2 hours later due to delays, and after 40 minutes inside the airplane they asked us to disembark the aircraft with all our luggage again. Their excuse was the weather conditions, however, there were multiple flights from other airlines to Punta Cana that left the airport without any delays or problems, except jetblue. We spent over $800 per ticket hoping to have a good experience and arrive at our destination on time, but they didn’t even give us any refunds, credit, or food/drinks. Horrible. Next time I wouldn't hesitate to book a flight from American Airlines in Miami, even closer to my home. Not to mention that the flight attendants and employees had a horrible attitude and didn’t even apologize for the constant inconveniences. We won’t be flying with JetBlue any longer, and I wouldn’t recommend anyone flying with them either.",-1

Flights both ways were delayed over 8 hours, the departing flight was cancelled. They said it was weather and the route, then they said the crew “timed out” then they said the pilot “timed out” and we could leave if they find another replacement. Never left. Moved flight to 8am and didn’t pay for a hotel. Then on my returning flight we got delayed 9 hours. Finally boarded and we were taxiing down the runway and then someone gets on the loudspeaker and says “hello everyone, this is extremely embarrassing but we are going to have to push back up to the gate, I’ve been notified we have some crew members that need to get on this flight” I thought it was a joke, but no. Then we get to the gate, nothing happens they make us deplane and cancel the flight. I’ve received zero compensation for this. I disputed with my credit card company because I did not receive anything I paid for.",-1
2021-07-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Portland via New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolutely terrible service,True,"  Absolutely terrible service. Not only did our original flight get rescheduled to a much later time frame, and leave late, we missed our connection to our final destination. The flight attendants lied to us and said we would be accommodated in a nearby hotel and to ask the ""Just Ask"" service center at JFK, the customer service rep there said there were no available hotel rooms and the flight attendants just lie to customers so they dont get upset on the plane. The customer service rep was extremely rude and unaccommodating, could not find a new flight, rental car, or hotel for us so left us stranded in JFK. Would never fly again.",-1
2021-07-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst experience ever,True,"  First time booking JetBlue. Absolutely worst experience ever. Flight was canceled 1.5 hour prior to departure with no reasons given. Rescheduled me for a different flight that’s over 24 hours later at a different airport that’s 30miles away. Offered 0 compensation for hotel or travel. Tried reaching agents at the “JustAsk” desks, they refused to service anyone who’s flight was canceled, told us to call JetBlue’s phone number, which was over 3hours on hold and hung up on me automatically after being on hold for 3 hours. In order to keep my original travel plan I had to pay over 600$ for a delta flight the same day. Honestly don’t fly Jetblue if you don’t want to get strangled at the airport for over 10 hours while trying to figure out how to get yourself over to your destination for JetBlue’s mistake.",-1
2021-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Boston,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,customer service is abysmal,False,"  Impossible to cancel my flight. They rerouted a flight I booked direct to add 7 hrs onto the trip. Their website isn’t working, nobody answers the phones, and the single desk at my local airport is closed. Wait for their website to start working again before booking because customer service is abysmal.",-1
2021-07-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Los Angeles,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,Flight delayed by 2.5 hrs,False,"  Horrible experience. Flight delayed by 2.5 hrs. By the time, we were all boarded, they said the plane didn't have enough fuel to fly to LA and needed to spend another 0.5 hr to refuel. When we arrived at LA, the plane had to stay on the tarmac for another 0.5 hr because the flight was so late and they have no gate for the plane at the moment. The only thing they were doing is the flight attendants kept saying ""we appreciate your patience and apologize for the delay"". I am pretty sure I heard that same statement at least 5 times on the plane. The movies selections are horrible. Only one drink service provided for a 6 hour flight. And we paid at least $100 dollars more for this plane ticket than United Air. I have to say, I will never consider Jetblue unless they are the only one in business.",-1
2021-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark (EWR) to San Juan (SJU),2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,They can keep the travel credits that they issued me,True," On 4th of July, JetBlue Flight 689 that was scheduled to take off at 3.45 pm was delayed and no explanation for the delay was provided to the passengers. Initially we were told that the flight will leave around 5.45 pm. Eventually, we boarded at 8.00 pm only to be told that the plane's toilets were not working. We were deplaned around 9.00 pm and told that we will be departing shortly. The delay kept prolonging till 1.00 am when we were asked to board the plane again. After the boarding was completed we were told that one flight attendant was missing and she was at the gate and we will leave as soon as she boards the plane. The elusive flight attendant never showed up and we waited till 2.30 am inside the plane when it was finally announced that the flight was being canceled. No refreshments and not even water was provided while we waited. From the get go Jet Blue had been lying about the status of the flight. When the flight was canceled they randomly booked passengers on different flights that were to leave more than 24 hours later. I was traveling with my girl-friend and we were booked on different flights and would not have reached San Juan for another 26 hours. By now it was 3.00 am in the morning and we had been at the airport for 12 hours because of the mismanagement by JetBlue. As if this was not enough, the two Jet Blue employees that were assigned to help the passengers were particularly rude to us. While we waited in the queue to have our issues addressed, the staff member went to another gate to check-in the passengers while there were three other Jet Blue employees at the gate. One staff member was left alone to take of a large number of passengers and she did not know how to handle the computer. When my girl-friend went to call the other staff member back, she got yelled at. Eventually, when the staff member returned to the booth she refused to handle our case even though we were at the front of the line. She started calling other passengers to the front leaving us waiting. I had asked for a full refund, instead they processed the case for a travel credit. She confirmed that she processed it for a refund but this morning I got an email from JetBlue that I have been issued a $200 credit to be used for future travel with JetBlue. Each ticket alone was almost double that amount plus baggage charges etc. JetBlue lied again. In the end we did not get a full refund, had to pay for our hotel in Newark, lost one day of hotel reservation and vacation time at San Juan and had our vacation ruined. This was the first time I was flying with JetBlue and will never do so again. They can keep the travel credits that they issued me. If you want to risk poorly maintained airplanes, missing crew and above all rude and unprofessional staff then JetBlue is the airline for you or else stay away!",-1
2021-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"no food, no hotel, no free future flights",False,"  The 7th of July 2021, JetBlue treated the passengers of Flight 100 shabbily. Six delay announcements and three gate changes ending up with no flight. The flight was to leave at 10.55 pm and was eventually cancelled at about 2.30 am on July 8th. An 8.00 am flight was offered. Many passengers took a chance on the 8 am flight while others opted for a refund. JetBlue offered no food, no hotel, no free future flights or anything. They didn't care.",-1
2021-07-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Montego Bay,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst experience ever,True,"  Worst experience ever and I’m still going through it. We arrived at 6:12am. Our flight was supposed to be for 8:54am. We had planned on trying to arrive about 3 hours early but got hung up a little bit at long term parking. Had tried checking in online the previous night multiple times but the system wasn’t able to process the check in and said I had to speak to a rep in person. Once at the airport we tried to scan our documents at one of the kiosks but got error messages that the reservation couldn’t be found so I started to get really worried and got in line. Waited in line almost 30 minutes and was finally next up when an employee comes over and announces that this line is only for domestic flights at which point 5-8 other groups also leave the line because there was no signage indicating that this area was for domestic only. I kept looking around thinking maybe I was oblivious and just didn’t see it, but there was nothing. And at the next area, there was nothing indicating that it was for international, but we knew we were in the right line now at least. So we wait and finally make it to the girl at the counter and hand her out passports. There obviously wasn’t any problem with our reservation because she promptly informed us that we had missed our check in time because our flight leaves at 8:54 and it was currently 7:57 or within a couple minutes of that and we needed to be checked in an hour ahead of time. So we lost over a day of our vacation, changed plans that had already been booked in advance, paid for an Uber to a hotel, and $200 for a hotel room so that we can try again tomorrow. But do you know what the best part is? I got a notification at 10:16 that the flight we were supposed to be on had just departed",-1
2021-07-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never use or recommend Jetblue Airways,True,  I had bought airline tickets for the family to fly to ATL Airport from Newark airport in NJ. We were scheduled to fly on July 2nd at 9:15pm.  Throughout the course of the night my husband and I continued to receive emails stating the flight was delayed. After the fifth email the final email stated cancelled at 2am. We had a car service in ATL waiting for us and we had a friend drive us to Newark Airport from Connecticut. We were stranded with a 2 year old and 2 teenagers in NJ. Jetblue rescheduled our flight for July 4th at JFK Airport and only gave $150.00 credit. We had to Uber from NJ to CT which cost use $323.00. It was the worst experience and this was going to be my 2nd time on a plane. I will never use or recommend Jetblue Airways to anyone,-1
2021-07-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bahamas,,,,,,1.0,1,I do not recommend this airline,False,"  My family and I have been looking forward to going on vacation for two years now! We are stuck at Kennedy Airport! We were supposed to fly out hours ago! We were informed that they didn't have a pilot! They have no answers to any of our questions! We have know idea when we will be leaving or even worse, the flight may be cancelled. This is not the first time I had an issue with JetBlue. I will never fly JetBlue again and I do not recommend this airline to anyone!",-1
2021-07-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to San Juan,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Yes I am very upset!,False,"  JetBlue is terrible and let me tell you why! I booked a trip to PR for me and my family because I was in a wedding. My flight was at 6.15am and I got to the airport at 4.00, am 2 hours early like they say. When I got there I tried to check in at the kiosk and it didn’t work, I tried on my phone and that didn’t work either. One of JetBlue employees told me to go to the kiosk help center. I get to the help center and another employee instructs me to wait in line even after I told her my plane was taking off at 6.15. She told me I can wait in this line or I can get off, by this time it was it was 4.23 and by the time I got to speak to somebody it was 5.43 and another employee rudely told me I missed my flight and gave me a flight for the next day. When I got out of line somebody told me there was a flight leaving at 8.15 but when I tried to get to the front of the line they told me I must wait in line again and the wait was 2 hours long. So basically I missed the wedding I was in and all JetBlue did was give me and my family a 100 dollar flight credit each. I paid 70 dollars for a Uber to the airport and 70 from the airport. Not to mention the hotel I was suppose to stay at said they will try to hold my room for me but since I’m not showing up today there’s no guarantee they can do that and I spent $1.700 on it. Yes I am very upset! I will never take JetBlue again. They said I should try to be a little earlier next time but 2 hours is early and if they wanted us there earlier they should send out emails or texts.",-1
2021-07-08,0.2,Business,Economy Class,San Juan to Newark,4.0,,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2,Less service more expense,True," I have been flying with JetBlue for a few years now and up until my last flight in June and my flight today, I was pretty happy with the company. Now I am ready to find a new airline. My flight today was originally scheduled to take off at 1.30 am. Around 9pm they inform us it has a 2 hour delay. Here I sit in the Airport at 3.45 am and the plane hasn't arrived, nor has it deplaned and there is no official update. Once upon a time they would give credits for delays, no more. To add insult to injury, they have raised their prices. Less service more expense, they are starting to also charge for carry-ons, which made them unique before. Funniest thing of all, if I try and buy a ticket with my JetBlue points, the price costs more than if I just pay cash. Even those are useless now. I know I am not alone in my feeling just read the recent reviews, we all say the same thing. Find another airline.",-1
2021-07-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Aruba to Boston,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,this trip has been horrible,False,"  My experience on this trip has been horrible. The trip from Boston to Aruba was horrible and today I am on my way back to Boston and it is also bad. Our flight has been delayed and they keep changing the departure time. My biggest complaint is that I am traveling with children. I PAID extra to have my seats assigned because I am traveling with children. Both times my seats were removed from me at checkin. On the way to Aru a we were seated at the very back of the plane and now as I sit here in the airport in Aruba I am waiting for them ""to see what they can do"" again I PAID extra for my seats why am I waiting to see what they can do if I purchased my seats? Customer service is horrible and I doubt I will fly jetblue again i am traveling with children and paid for a direct flight with seats together why make me pay if they weren't going to uphold it.",-1
2021-07-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2,Jetblue truly does not care,False,"  What used to be my favorite airline is now a customer's nightmare. The biggest problem, besides being treated as steerage class, is the nastiness of some of the cabin staff. I will be sending a complaint to corporate. Just be aware of many delays, surly crewmembers and the most uncomfortable seats and lack of headphones pretty much make for an unhappy flying experience. Jetblue truly does not care.",-1
2021-07-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,worst flying experience,False,"  No pilot show, whole jetblue flight boarding zone is cloudy, there are people waiting from 3pm boarding to consistently change to the next day 2am. 2/3 flight cancelled, people fighting over there, police men is busy around but not really helpful. We have flight boarding from 6:00pm constantly delaying every 2 hours, until midnight 2 am, they announce cancellation. Auto book tickets for the next day 3pm from NY Westchester airport, while my friends booked from JFK 2PM, and delay 4 hours again. We decided change to United, depart on time, arrived earlier than scheduled. Flight not able to cancel because customer service waiting line is 290mins, on phone all day, still not able go through, guess real waiting time is. Ended up to give us no show, no refund. no sleep over 48 hours. NO Jetblue ever, worst flying experience ever.",-1
2021-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,JFK to ORD,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,go home we have no information,False,"  We were traveling from JFK to ORD, we got the airport and found out that our flight is 4 hours late. ok we thought it happens no biggie. 4 hours later when it was close to the time we should be boarding we receive an email that our flight is cancelled. No explanation, no rebooking to a different flight. when my husband went to talk to someone at the counter, the lady said go home we have no information for you. So we get on line to see if we can book a flight our selves because we want to go home, we are tired after a vacation in NY. There were no flights available from JFK that night or next day out of JFK. We found some flight out of Newark, NJ next day so we booked a hotel in Newark, uberd to NJ and flew out next day. I called and emailed Jet blue for a refund and guess what they don't answer, and no email response. So not only that we didn't get a refund for our flight they cancelled, we lost about a 1,000.00 for uber, hotel, and flight to get home. I've never experienced anything like this in my life",-1

This is my second time flying with them and second time with a pretty big delay. Happened last time and was 3 hours they offered me no refreshments and there were no stores open. It made me late to my work meeting in Manhattan. This time I honestly forgot when booking, and it has happened again. I have done this flight roughly 20 times with American and yet to have a delay. I will not be returning for a 3rd let down. Airline must be as unorganized as the people working the desk here.",-1
2021-07-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,Awful flight experience,True,"  Awful flight experience this past Thursday 7/1/21. My family and I were on flight 6 from Fort Lauderdale to Newark, NJ on the 5:18pm flight. It got delayed to 5:48pm due to weather. No biggie, we waited and boarded when called. Once we were on the airplane and beginning to taxi the pilot made an announcement that Newark is not accepting flights into their airport due to weather and we would be waiting on the active runway for at least an hour prior to take off. An hour came and went and 2 hours later they tell us we will be going back to the gate to wait out the storm as they had no idea when Newark would open up for arrivals again. Back to the gate we go and we deboard. Now mind you I have a 4year old and an 8 year old in tow with me. Back at the gate we wait for a status of when we may be taking off again. At 9:30pm they make an announcement that we will try to board again for a 10:30pm take off. We board and finally take off. We landed in Newark at 12:40pm and to our surprise we are told we will be on the runway for 40 minutes as we have no gate to go to. Passengers at this point are irate. If no gate was available you should have known this and cancelled the flight. To have us fly to an airport with no gates available is ridiculous. The 40 minutes turned into 3 hours of waiting for a gate. We were offered no water or snacks while waiting. I had a young boy beside himself behind me due to the stress of having to remain on the airplane after landing. We were hostages for those 3 hours while you searched for a gate to go to. We were one of 8 planes that did not have a gate. They finally opened a closed international terminal 3 hours later. You should have had portable stairs used to get us off the plane and a shuttle bus to take us to the terminal. Not so hard to do. The lack of compassion was amazing and I will no longer be using your company for my flying needs. Your planes need attention as well as this whole flight the TVs did not work even when they were rebooted by the flight attendants. Also I had purchased 5 tickets to sit together in a row. At check in you moved 3 of us to a different row and 2 of us in the back of the plane? My whole point was to have my family fly together in the same row and paid for it and it didn’t happen for whatever reason. You have lost a customer for sure. All Jet Blue needed to do was show a little compassion and hand out a voucher credit to the passengers in which this ordeal created so much stress for but nothing was done. Way to drop the ball. I have a home in Florida that I travel back and forth frequently and will no longer be flying JetBlue and will make sure the public is aware of your lack of service and compassion in the transportation department.",-1
2021-07-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Montego Bay,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3,quite unfortunate after being ill-advised by the JetBlue representative,False,"  On Sunday the 27th of June I was schedule to return to Jamaica on Flight 579 at 3.31 pm. At the point of boarding, I was advised by JetBlue's representative that my COVID-19 test was invalid, I inquired of the representative if there was anywhere I could have another test done, and I was told in a manner that was unbecoming of what I was expecting from a customer service representative. After insisting on getting some instruction on how to proceed, I was later directed to the 'Just Ask' desk, where I was informed that a test could be done in the airport at no cost. Subsequent to leaving the desk, I inquired where the COVID-19 test was done and I was told that it is not done there anymore, I would have to find somewhere outside the airport to get it done. This caused anxious moments owing to the fact that this was Sunday and I had a reschedule flight for Monday morning at 5.45. Eventually, I was directed to another section of the airport where I had the test done for $200. I was later told that this same test could be done free of cost at a location managed by JetBlue. This I think was quite unfortunate after being ill-advised by the JetBlue representative.",-1
2021-07-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Providence,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,no one had the decency to tell me,False,  My daughter booked me a ticket to go see my grandbabies on July 2nd flying out of Fort Lauderdale. Since I often have issues with my breathing they gave me a wheelchair and bought me to gate G10 heading to Providence. Unfortunately I was unable to stay awake because I had gotten up at 4am on that day. I had seen countless people working that day and one had even helped me to the bathroom earlier that day but when I feel asleep they moved the gate and no one had the decency to tell me. Thank goodness my phone rang about 10 minutes before they were boarding and a stranger helped me to the gate. Unfortunately during my scare I drop my phone and cracked the screen. I will never fly with Jetblue again. How could they see an old man sleeping on a wheelchair at the gate with 2 carry-ons and not brother to ask if hes ok.,-1

I have been on hold more than 20 hours in total. They simply do not care and are using covid as a crutch! I have also been to the JFK terminal 5 2x and stood in line for more than 2 hours. I will never fly with Jetblue again. What an amazing lack of service or concern for clientele.,-1
2021-07-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to New York,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3,Never flying with them again!,False,"  Absolutely disappointed. Flight was delayed three times, then cancelled. Did not have any room for overnight accommodations and or flights to New York within the next day. The earliest flight was three days later. The staff were very lax and or over it. I had to sleep on the airport where it was freezing and did not have access to bottled water and food or snacks let alone a blanket for warmth. So highly upset. Finally had to book a flight to Fort Lauderdale as a connect but I have to come out of pocket to fly back to NY. JetBlue has caused me to lose money. Never flying with them again!",-1
2021-07-03,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Albuquerque to New York JFK,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3,Family disappointed - exhausted by this whole mess,True," I have flown JetBlue for years to visit my son and daughter in law who live in New York. I have always been pleased with economical fares and service until this week. Details: flight booked to depart ABQ. at 11.42pm on July 1st. JetBlue sent cancellation notice at 9.42pm, even though they knew about this hours prior. Phone hold times 140-240 minutes. Flight rebooked for July 2nd departure at 11.50pm. Okay, one day of vacation burned but will still try. Email received that this flight cancelled 1.30pm. Email at 2.00pm that it was rescheduled with 1.30am departure. Changed again to depart 11.50pm at 3.00pm. Arrived at airport and boarded flight 11.40pm. Sat on plane until 1.44am. Flight crew said there was a weight issue and moved a few rows of passengers to rear of plane. Just as they finished this, pilot announced that due to delay flight was cancelled and would not depart. Deplaned. Email at 3.02am that flight was delayed to July 3rd at 12.10pm. I think okay - can still make family dinner, email at 3.09am delayed to 2.38pm. I lost 2 days hotel cost, three trips to airport since JetBlue evidently only has one telephone operator and messages says to see live agent. Parking fees $40. Family disappointed - exhausted by this whole mess. No straight answers.",-1
2021-07-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San diego to New York JFK,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,never again,False,"  I never check bags cause I've only has issues in the past,.but this time it was fool proof. Jetblue offered a free checked carry-on at the gate 20 feet from where the plane was parked and I can see it right out the window. I mistakenly took the offer an they impressed me by losing it somehow in transit from the boarding desk, down that little hallway that leads into the plane .. it ended up in Jersey somehow an I was flying into JFK. They said it'd be sent right out .. 10 days now, and I have no bag. Unreal. Always was my favorite airline but this is absolute nonsense. Now I have to do all the legwork tracking down fedex who is also embarrassing itself. The worst part about all this, is that all I was offered to make up for it was a $30 voucher which is a disgrace considering the extra hour I had to pay my drive at the airport, all my toiletries I had to buy to hold me over, and just the absolute headache getting temp work credentials every time I go to work because my credentials are in that bag, not to mention passport .. never again.",-1

Usually, they help you with the baggage tag, the person in charge tells me that is not his job to help people with the baggage tag, and if you don't like it, you can go to jetblue.com and complain. They delayed flight 2885 nobody provided us with explanations.

My last one trip before that was almost a year ago and I was my emotional support dog and they even let me open his bag down on my feet. And I never could let be him in my lap. They was really rude. After that I was just travel with AA. Today again I have the same problem, they are really crazy rude. Anytime your mask slides down, someone threatening to kick you off the plane. And honest was not the polite way, me and everybody who was in the plane was really upset how they was treat was. That is crazy.",-1
2021-07-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Austin,4.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,It was almost comical how slowly the entire crew moved,True," First of all they delayed the flight from 9.50pm to 10.30pm, and then to 11.30pm, and then 11.42pm when in reality we didn't even board until 12.00am. Then it took until 12.45am to even begin to move away from the gate and we finally took off at 1am. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand things are out of their hands sometimes and planes get delayed. The reason I'm upset is how poorly they handled the delay and everything that followed. They couldn't be bothered to actually follow the delay schedule by boarding at 11.42, we didn't even board until after our 3rd-delay-take off time. And the best part is our plane was there the entire time. The plane arrived at the gate at 10.30pm and we still didn't even board until 12am. Normally when a plane is delayed the workers try their best to speed up the boarding process at least a little bit. It was almost comical how slowly the entire crew moved. They took their sweet time and made everything as slow and painful as possible. This was quite literally one if the absolute worst flying experiences I've ever had and has further cemented my belief that Jetblue is absolutely not the right airline to use.",-1

I flew them once to Hawaii years ago and loved it. But this week I flew them and in multiple airports they seemed overwhelmed and unprepared for post covid travel. Most of their employees have horrible customer service. I had a terrible experience with one who seemed as though she didn’t know what she was doing and when I tried to ask her a question she just cut me off and refused to listen. One of the other employees over heard her and came up to me after to answer my question. Shout out to the staff member in the Newark airport (Jetblue terminal) for her excellent customer service. They need more associates like that. But I probably won’t be flying Jetblue again,-1

I booked an Iceland Air flight through Jet Blue, and needed to make changes. This can't be done on the website, it must be via telephone. I called three times this week, only to see wait times of over 2 hours each time. I finally mustered the energy to hang in there for 2 hours and 21 minutes. Finally got through to a service agent. I told her I was trying to change a flight that was booked through a partner airline. Without asking for any more information, she informed me that she needed a supervisor to do this! I was promptly put on hold again, this time with no warning about how long it was going to take. Still on hold. Amusing myself by making sure other people are aware of what is happening. I will never book through JetBlue again.",-1

On travel day the issue was fixed but the seats I had paid for were changed. En route to Aruba there was an issue and we were rerouted to NY. While there they had us waiting with no announcements. We did not get our stroller back so had a toddler running around. The people at the ticket counter were extremely rude. My toddler was hit on the head with a sign that some other kid knocked down in the chaos. They changed our seats again then boarded us at around 1 pm. It is now 3.35 and we are sitting on a plane with a baby that needs his diaper changing (ran out of extras since this has been an all day event and I had only packed enough for a 4 hour flight), the incompetent people at the ticket counter are boarding people 2 at a time and at this point we will be taking off at 5pm. I am traveling with children that are hungry and tired. The airline does not offer food and by the time we get to our Airbnb in Aruba there won't be anywhere to get them food. I am outraged that I paid so much money for a family vacation that has started so horribly because of Jetblue staff. I would like to make it clear that the stewards on board the plane have been very nice, the problem are the ones working the gate.",-1

2021-06-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,Boston to Atlanta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Tragic experience,True," First, there was probably over 500 people trying to checkout tickets at kiosk and it said we needed to see a crew member for assistance. Went to a crew member that was standing to the side, we had to go wait in the line to check in bags. Now, this line was long, it was a 15 min wait just to get one ticket. Then the line for security was wrapped all the way around and was out the exit. Then TSA allowed two girls to cut this long line even when people were telling them no. I waited in this line just for my gate to close. And then wouldn’t let us on. Plane sat there for 11 minutes before the pilot took his foot off the brake. Tragic experience. And now the next flight home isn’t till 4pm tomorrow and my family has to split up one is going on a 7am.",-1
2021-06-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft. Myers to Newark,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Spend your money elsewhere please,True," I cannot say anything worse about this airline. Original roundtrip flight from Newark to Sarasota changed 2 times. Then they changed the actual arrival dates, so I had to cancel and rebook in Ft. Myers. The flight cost triple, plus I had fees for cancelling a car rental. I drive with 2 kids an hour and 40 minutes the opposite way to our flight which was then delayed over 6 hours. It was delayed because they did not have a flight crew available. Unacceptable...not weather, not act of god, but simply poor management on the one job you need to do. Flight 1712 on June 26th 2021. While waiting hours in Ft. Myers we watched a separate JetBlue flight strike the skywalk while pulling into the terminal. This caused further delays and passengers to exit off the stairs. (Not easy with bags). We finally get on our flight and the TV does not work for either of my kids. They share my TV while I watch cartoons with no sound. We then get to Newark where we sit on the runway for an additional 50 minutes. So Family and all passengers were enraged with a glib attitude of some, not all, JetBlue staff. We get off plane with the flight crew saying they don’t know which carousel the bags will be on. This causes dozens of people to wait at the Jetblue Carousel 8, but the bags are sent to Carousel 1 on the opposite side of the airport. Everyone moves to get bags, but about 5 separate passengers never receive their checked bags, myself included. It takes over 20 minutes to locate a JetBlue employee who’s priority is telling everyone she can’t talk to unless everyone stays 10 feet back, however no one can hear her speak under her mask. After looking at my bag receipt she advises me they do not have a record my bags were ever put on the plane and they will attempt to track it. Or it may have been on another carousel and stolen, who knows. I call the next day and there is no update. My starting travel time was 9.30am and I did not leave the airport until 1am the next day. This is for a flight from Florida to New Jersey in good weather. Bag still lost, but I did get an apology email that I may get a credit on a future flight...really? And the only reason I flew JetBlue was because they owed me credit from a previous failed flight, but that’s another story. Spend your money elsewhere please. These companies do not learn unless it hits their pocket.",-1
2021-06-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Provinciales,3.0,,3.0,,,5.0,3,terrified of this aggressive women,True,  Upon boarding a jetblue attendant was by line asking passengers to have boarding pass ready. My hands were full but U had boarding pass out but not opened I was not in front of scanner. I told her my hands were full she said open them up now because I have the power to ruin your trip and ground you! My wife walked up and she said to her I am in control and can easily ruin your trip if you upset me in any way. My wife and I were shocked. Upon approaching agent scanning boarding pass she asked what that agent was saying we told her she shook her head and said you should report her! The agent who was harassing us and threatening shouted across room saying I want that mans name! We we’re actually terrified of this aggressive women. Will never fly Jetblue out of FLL again this woman women was harassing and threatening everyone saying she is going to ruin their vacation and groin them. I did not get her name because we were trying to stay fr away from her. Very scary women! Hopefully she didn’t ground any passengers she is really using the power card for her own personal hatred for passengers,-1

Not only have I tried ones to fly with them but I tried one more time and they keep messing up. I have booked three flights with JetBlue and all three have been cancelled or delayed. This last one today June 25/2021 they completely changed my itinerary and the flight to last 24 hours between Cancun and fort Lauderdale without any solutions. They changed both the day and the time to completely different dates and times making our trip impossible. The flight has been delayed 3 times pushing our departure back multiple hours. The original flight was expected to leave at 4:20 pm. We received 5 emails with a delay pushing it back while we are at the airport. Our previous flight December 2020 was cancelled due to a COVID 19 emergency and when I brought this up they said due to their policies we couldn't get a refund or credit. I agree this company deserves to be shut down.,-1
2021-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolutely no regards for customers,True,"  This was the 1st and last time I traveled on JetBlue. They have absolutely no regards for customers. I had a domestic flight leaving at 4.30pm, I was at the airport since 3 pm, I checked in the night before so I had my boarding pass, I went to the kiosk to print a luggage tag for the bag that I was checking in. The machine was having issues, tried another one and it would not print. When I asked for help I was sent to the help desk line which was long and would take over 1 hour for me to get to the front. I indicated that to them and explained that I had a flight to catch at 4.30, and the response was that it was my problem not theirs. Tried several times to explain that I would miss my flight and all I needed was the luggage tag, and each time I was told to go and wait, that is your problem. I had to stand in that line for over 2 hours and of course I missed my flight, I was bumped up to the next flight at 9.30pm being told that my son and I got the last two seats and we were lucky (really!) I did not get home till 2 am. All this could have been avoided with just a little help or with staff members willing to do their jobs at JFK airport. I rather pay more and fly with another airline. Never again JetBlue.",-1

Not only have I never had the opportunity to fly with them but I keep trying and they keep messing up. I have booked three flights with JetBlue and all three have been cancelled or delayed. The first two they completely changed my itinerary without any solutions. They changed both the day and the time to completely different dates and times making our trip impossible. The third time they did exactly what we thought they would do. The flight was delayed 6 times pushing our departure back multiple hours. The original flight was expected to leave at 11.59 pm. We received 6 emails with a delay pushing it back past 3.05 am. The email that said our flight would get delayed past 3.05 am was sent to us at 12.53 am. Then at 3.24 am we received an email stating that the flight left at 12.34 Am. We missed our flight due to their communication being faulty. When I brought this up they said due to us missing our flight and not cancelling prior to departure we couldn't get a refund or credit. This company deserves to be shut down.,-1
2021-06-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Fransico to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,totally ignored passengers,True,"  I explained to your desk people that I needed an aisle seat when I checked in at SFO airport. She tried to sell me one for an extra fee. I rejected the offer, and I got no seat assignment. I got the seat number at the boarding gate. When I boarded on the plane, I was put next to a 5-year-old boy unaccompanied minor. The boy was jumping and taping the desk, he could never be quiet. The noise gave me a headache and my blood pressure went up. I asked your crew members for help, the first one did nothing, I had to stand up to ask another crew who tried to sell expansive seat at checking-in desk, She immediately said the plane was full without checking. It wasn’t. But once again tried to upsell me $95 more, you can get one.( when I checked in the airport, the seat costs $135 extra). Do your crew members even know the actual occupancy of the seats on the plane they are serving on? Is your airline customer service managed through lying and deceptions? During the flight the attendant spent all of her time on her cell, and totally ignored passengers and their requests. I became the care giver to the unaccompanied minor , to make sure whether he has safety belt on or mask on . Your crews never came up to check them. Only once, That is done by my asking. I am Jet Blue club member, I did quite often fly with you before. But I stopped for awhile because your planes were always delayed, and unsatisfied service. This time I thought I could be lucky. I wasn’t",-1
2021-06-24,0.3,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Orlando,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2,used to be one of our favorite airlines,False,"  JetBlue used to be one of our favorite airlines. In the past the customer service both in and out of the plane were amazing. Unfortunately the flight we just took changed that feeling for us. To start off with we were waiting on the runway for approximately 40 minutes with no air conditioning. The captain explained that the air conditioning would work once we took off but by that time my daughter was already feeling a little sick. Once in the air the flight attendants spent the great part of the trip policing people and making sure they were wearing a mask. They were rude and it seems on this airline that customer service has gone out the window. Everyone was complying with the mask requests but there should have been a point where they just let people rest. The pilot communication was ok but could have been better. It looks like JetBlue traded customer service to basically admonishing its passengers the whole flight. Comparatively, our flight back home on United was impeccable. The crew was very friendly and gracious to its passengers which is the way it should be.",-1

Then it was delayed about 2 more times. Our flight finally took off at around 10pm. The flight attendants were very unpleasant and had no Customer Service skills. I went to use the bathroom the first time and was told to hurry up because our flight was to be taking off meanwhile after I used the bathroom we sat there 2 hours before the flight left. The second time I went to use the bathroom I was told again to hurry up. These flight attendants seem to not either like their job or need to brush up on their Customer Service skills. This was a very unpleasant flight and poor Customer Service. Also, the entire flight back we couldn't watch any movies because it was not working the entire flight.",-1
2021-06-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Fort Myers via Erie,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,Jetblue Airways customer review,True," On the way down to Florida the pilot flew us into some of the worst weather and turbulence I have experienced in the last 60+ trips air travel. Their were 8 people throwing up at once and they ran out of bags! We diverted to Fort Lauderdale because we didn't have enough fuel, then took off again to get back to Fort Myers. But that isn't why I am complaining even though the pilot knew the weather in Fort Myers was impossible to land in before putting us through that. On the trip home at 8 am I get a notification that the home route to Boston was delayed, this was a shock since I paid for a direct flight to Cleveland Ohio. Now we would be unable to get the second plane home and they had no affiliated airlines. I have two dogs and had paid for a house sitter, who was leaving that night. The only thing they offered was a flight the next day! I had to buy a ticket through United at 2.5 times the cost. They literally could not care less about our situation or the costs I had to pay for this. I will never consider using this airline again and will make sure no one I care about does either. They have zero online, phone or in person service period. The cost saving is not worth this third world country level operation.",-1

The whole team needs to be trained, they are very rude. I am writing the review from the airplane with Jetblue right now, I was not able to reach home to give a review because of their rudeness. At least when someone says thank you, at least what you can do is reply back. The bathroom is so dirty. I would never ever fly with them even if it was just as a connecting flight. They do not know how to treat customers. All I am asking is to be treated well as I am treating you.",-1
2021-06-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft Lauderdale,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,example of incompetence and disregard,False,"  Once upon a time JetBlue used to be a good airline. Sadly they have become a text book example of incompetence and disregard. I took a trip to ft Lauderdale and wanted to extend my trip. I called the help line to work through the issue because the app wouldn’t let me. When I called I was told that I would have a wait time of 120 minutes. I hung up called back a day later and was told the wait time was 145 minutes. I tried. Couple of more times and finally gave up. On the day of the flight, I received an email informing me that the flight that was at 9pm would be delayed for 3 hours and leave at 12AM. When I arrived at the airport, I was told by one of the people working the gate that the crew apparently did not show up. Throughout this experience I got the distinct impression that they could care less about their brand or the service that they provide.",-1
2021-06-17,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Portland,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,She was extremely helpful and friendly,True,  Rode Jetblue for my vacation with my family and on the ride back we were welcomed and helped by a flight attendant by the name of Kendra on flight 2205. She was extremely helpful and friendly. Not only to us but the rest of the passengers as well. Great with children and going above and beyond for the passengers. A perfect example of customer service. 10/10 would recommend Ms. Kendra on another flight if possible.,1
2021-06-17,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Key West to JFK New York,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,he is a saint among humans,False,"  Rudy works in Jet Blue's baggage-claim department at New York's JFK airport - and he is a saint among humans. Like a knucklehead, I left my laptop computer outside the Jet Blue terminal. Later that evening, I received a text from someone saying they had found my computer and had turned it into Jet Blue's lost-and-found area. When I called the person who texted me, he said his name was Rudy and that he was happy to help. Sure enough, when I went back to the airport, my laptop was there waiting for me! When he found my computer, he saw my name on the home screen and typed it into Jet Blue’s computer to see if someone with the same name was traveling around that time. When he found my name in the system, he also had my phone number - that’s how he texted me! When Rudy’s supervisor, who handed over my computer, explained how Rudy had found me, I couldn't help but detect the boss' pride. Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to leave Rudy a reward, so this is the best I can do. But I hope the good folks at Jet Blue will see fit to give him a raise. Great organizations are built on the shoulders of great employees like Rudy.",1

When we were at the airport and having some issue with the self check out ,the three staff members who were at the JFK airport were brushing us and telling us to try to keep trying and the machine kept denying. Finally My husband went to the costumer service to clarify and they asked us to go to the counter. All this process took our 30-40 min. When we reached the line to go into the counter the older guy who was standing at the line was very rude and told us to go back to do the self check out despite telling him that we couldn’t get through self check out . We insisted that we need to stay in the line to get our boarding pass . He said “you are late and you are not going to get in this flight “ . We waited in the line for another 1 hr , only two counters were and there were a counter where the lady was standing for long time not taking any costumers . I don’t know is that what she suppose to do during busy travel time , I would think she should be assisting her colleagues. When we at the counter the lady started the process and asked for QR code from health insurance for Costa Rica which we didn’t have it but the attitude and rudeness we received from the staff was unbelievable . Instead of assisting us with whatever we need to get to the fight she told us to stand to the side . We were clueless and very upset . We keep asking around what we should do and where we should get a QR code . No one was there to assist us or help us , when we book the ticket Expedia inform us that we needed to buy Heath insurance to go to Costa Rica . We googled and asked another passenger who were able to help us . By then we missed our flight. We spend whole day in the airport figuring out what to do and eventually we got rescheduled our flight to next day after spending extra $300 and did our covid test again to fly . On the day of flight 6/11/21 we were inside the airplane waited 2 hrs for a set of crew to join us to fly back the plane . Our flight was delayed 2 hrs due to this . Hope this is not a regular incident that happen on every flight with Jet blue . All I want to stay is that all the Jet blue staff need to be re-educated in customer service training and in assisting the travelers when they need help . Basically do your job ! Travel during covid time with kids are not easy . We are taking your service doesn’t mean that you can treat us however your staff feel .",-1

On the way down my screen was dysfunctional, on the return it worked. Interesting selection of movies. Flight crew cheerful and willing. Leg room adequate. Food available was unappetizing.

The flight attendants are the absolute bestseller. They will do anything to make you comfortable and safe. I have been using JetBlue for over 15 years and it always gets better.

2021-06-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Jacksonville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,does not have customer service,True,"  Jetblue does not have customer service as part of Jetblue's culture. They do not care about the customer whatsoever. I mean they canceled our overnight flight from Los Angeles to Florida when we were supposed to get there in the morning, get picked up by the RV dealer, go for a walkthrough, take the position of the motorhome, and get on our way. As the result, we ended up getting there on Monday midnight, had to rent a car, find a hotel, and check-in by 3:45, finally, call the dealership the next day, get the next available appointment on Wednesday, and leave town on Wednesday night. This cost us: Car rental $183 Hotel $315 2 extra days of our time I've called Jetblue 3 times 1st time, after being on hold for more than 2 hours,  they offered me $50 per person which I did not accept and the rep so rudely hung up on me. 2nd time, after 1 hour 52 mins of being on hold they hung up on me just like that. 3rd time, after 2 hours 19 mins of holding the rip went through everything with me and accepted to pay me $100 per person but again before making the arrangements, she just hung up. I really don't know what have we ever done to Jetblue to deserve such poor customer service. We paid the price for the tickets and showed up, any other airline would have made the right accommodations. Just because someone else is ok with a change does not mean everyone else is also on board. There are people like my wife and myself who had a very tight budget upon which had made plans and scheduled everything. We truly can not afford the extra costs caused for us by Jetblue.",-1

This is about their customer service practices on the phone. And how it is now impossible to write a complaint on their website. I today June 7 called to reschedule my trip back to the original time of flight departure. I couldn't do it on my own due to a $4.00 difference. So I called to be put on hold for as I was told for 110 minutes. So I waited on my only day off. Only to be hung up on, so I had to cancel my flight, buy another flight on the original time I booked, only to be credited to a travel bank credit, only to not be able to access my travel bank credit. Only to call back to be automatically told your wait time is 98 minutes.  want someone at Jetblue to see this since getting on their complaint website is impossible.

I specifically booked JetBlue because I thought it was a good airline. Here were the issues: 1) No seat assignment at check-in, unless AU was willing to spend another $118 to have a seat assigned, there were no available seats, so I did not get one. Experience tells me this is bad because it means you are the first one bumped. 2) I was assured by an employee that JetBlue does not bump passengers, and I was not, 3) But - the seat I got at the gate was the last row, seat does not recline, the seat is highly uncomfortable - a deep butt impression in a relatively new airplane. Final verdict: Instead of seeking JetBlue out, I’ll do my best to avoid this airline - not worth it.",-1

I was already at the airport hour prior  to that. When I asked one JetBlue employee about putting me on another flight she say they don’t do that but at least she was responding in kind manners. Then when I asked another employee why the flight was delayed and other flights were still on time he showed me rude way that he doesn’t control clouds and there’s nothing he can do about it. Extremely rude. One of flight attendants was handing me a snack without saying anything, when I smiled and asked her if she has any sweet snacks she handed me another snack (all this with a mean face) went back and announced to all flight what kind of snacks they are serving. The flight was delayed a full 3 hours without any refreshments or anything, I spent my whole day at Miami airport. I basically left hotel room in Miami at noon and got in Boston at 9.30 pm. Just to compare this flight with Delta they messaged that the flight be taking off earlier 40 minutes and they were giving water bottles for welcoming on board. Huge difference.",-1

Finally, when someone answered, they were very rude and in a rush. Terrible customer service! JetBlue doesn’t care if you have children. They will assign your children to any open seat and won’t keep your family together. Basically, they want to charge extra for seats. Customer service doesn’t care how old is your child. If you paid for a ticket, you must pay for a seat or JetBlue will assig ANY seat to your children. Terrible service!  JetBlue charges for carry on bags, the only free item is a personal bag like a PC bag. Terrible! Departure and arrival times: JetBlue is most likely to be late, their representatives at the counters are slow and make everything a terrible experience. My flights were delay 2 hours for ticket issues. They allowed to board the plane people with different destinations, yes, as you heard, I had one guy trying to seat on my seat. He had the right seat number but he was on a wrong plane. I can’t believe the personnel at the counter let him get in. JetBlue has the worst customer service!",-1

I booked a flight for my husband, my two year old, and myself. Leaving Fl there were no issues with my flight, checking in for my flight to return to Fl I noticed they placed my two year old in a seat away from my husband and myself. I decided to call to see if this situation could be handled prior to my flight, I waited on hold for over a hour and 45 minutes. When I did meet a representative she was very rude, argumentative, and combative. I asked to speak with her superior and was transferred to a woman who was just as rude.

We couldn’t fly from JFK because we had a physical (migration) form that they require and literally at the gate they told us, literally 10 minutes before closing the gate that we couldn’t board the plane because we had to have the same form but in digital form. Of course we asked him for the website and he gave us the wrong one. We lost so much time trying to fill that form that they close the gate. And even before closing the gate the pilot told the staff that we could fill the form in the plane or when we arrived to Colombia. But the guy at the gate didn’t let us.",-1

JetBlue gets points for even offering the route at all, it's nice to be able to fly to the west coast without having to connect. The flights were also incredibly cheap - $159 roundtrip on a holiday weekend is a steal. However, the flights left several things to be desired. The timing of the flights is awful, the outbound flight left Richmond at 9pm and arrived in LA close to midnight, while the return flight is a redeye that leaves LAX at midnight and arrives back in Richmond at 7.40am. The flight out was uncomfortable and bumpy, but the flight back was where JetBlue really lost points. The flight back is only 4.5 hours, for passengers are to get any sleep at all, the service needs to be very quick and the lights need to be turned all the way off as soon as possible. Other airlines running redeye flights from the west coast to the east do this. However, the flight attendants on this flight spent an hour selling stuff and handing out drinks and snacks, and then kept blue mood lights on for the entire flight. This made it impossible for me to sleep, and I was not the only person who was kept up. Since JetBlue is unable to operate redeye flights in a way which lets passengers get rest, I recommend avoiding their redeye flights.",-1

2021-05-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St Lucia to Boston,,,,,,,2,took away a whole days vacation,False,  We have a trip planned to St. Lucia in October. Jet Blue cancelled our flight home Sunday so they took away a whole days vacation on us. This trip is very expensive and I don't understand why they had to cancel Sunday flights instead of waiting until Monday. I don't understand how they can upend peoples lives like this. This is so unfair!,-1

The first flight was not only late, we had to change gates. On our connecting flight we had to change gates twice, with a long walk to both gates. Then once we got home, I unpacked and found that my laptop had a broken screen even though I'd packed it so that it wouldn't get damaged. I would have given it a higher rating for value for money, but since I now have to replace my laptop, this trip cost me $1000 more.",-1

My trip/vacation was scheduled/book for the day of my flight. When I contacted customer service I was not offered a flight voucher or a refund.

I was on Flight B6780 from Montego Bay, Jamaica to JFK NY, the 4:11pm flight. The Flight Attendant was David. I was able to observe him in action in dealing with what I would call a combative passenger. He was very professional and keep his cool when the passenger was very rude in speaking to another flight attendant that was just doing her job in asking the passenger if she was okay to sit in the exit row. He made a bad situation much better for all around and his professionalism was on point. I enjoyed my trip and I thank him for all he did to make sure, the rude passenger was satisfied and all the passengers that observe the situation was comfortable and had a pleasant flight. Thank you very much, and I hope to see you on future flight with JetBlue.",1

We assumed this meant that we were staying on the same plane when we stopped for our “layover”, but found out while checking in that we were expected to board an entirely new plane with zero minutes in between. They informed us that the next flight to our destination was not until five days later. Our only option was to find a new airline, which still wouldn’t leave until the following day and would cost $400 more a person. They made no attempt to accommodate us as we would clearly need to pay for an additional hotel (possibly up to 4 nights) and no vouchers were given. Customer service took over an hour to reach by phone. I am thoroughly disappointed with JetBlue service and would recommend literally any other airline over this one.",-1

The seats are comfortable and the employees are customer friendly. Use their credit card and get Mosaic status",1
2021-05-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Phoenix,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Don’t fly JetBlue,False,"  On April 25th we were to fly from Boston to Phoenix. Arriving at the airport we found out the flight would be delayed for about 2½ hours. All the other flights on the board were on time, weather was not an issue. We found out at the gate that the flight was delayed due to mechanical issues from Fort Myers. The plane arrived and we were to take off at 11:53 am instead of 9:20 am. As the customers were boarding, someone made an “off the cuff” remark to the pilot who was greeting passengers. The remark led to the pilot getting on the intercom once were all seated that he felt he “needed to take an alcohol blood test based on the customer remark”. He said the testing area was right outside the gate and he would be back in 20 minutes. An hour and 40 minutes later he returned. The flight was now delayed four hours. How can one person who is not in control of an operating aircraft make such a decision without input from senior ground crew members. So, if you ever want to delay a Jet Blue flight, just ask to speak to the pilot and send them a joke about their physical condition. Just before we took off a customer representative came on board and said we all would get a $100 rebate. This was not well received based on what we had been through and like us we had plans in and around the Phoenix area that would now not happen. For us we were out the $485 for a Jeep excursion tour. $200 would not cut it. I contacted JetBlue Customer Relations. After a 45 minute delay I was eventually transferred to a person described as a Supervisor. She refused to compensate us for the expense we incurred. When we inquired about the ability for a pilot on the ground to solely decide on further delaying a flight, she referenced policy #37 which said the pilot has total control. So, if you ever need to reset or delay a JetBlue flight, just make a comment to the pilot that he is not in condition to fly. You may be able to delay a flight that someone might be trying to make. Once the plane is in the air, I agree the pilot is in charge. But on the ground with a flight that has already been delayed due to the fault of the airline, then the airline, JetBlue, needs to adjust their policy and have more people in on the decision to effect the lives of 200 + paying customers. Don’t fly Jet Blue.",-1

2021-05-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Miami,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Not worth the price over other airlines,True,"  JetBlue is basically now a more expensive Spirit Airlines. It’s terrible. On the flight to Miami, everyone kept checking their seats if they were dirty because the pleather seat covers were in such poor condition that some had holes, and all of them and had stains on them. The seat recliner on my seat was broken so the seat kept bouncing back and forth during the flight, and one of the flight staff were extremely rude about the mask policy. I was talking to the flight attendant and my mask came down off my nose while I was speaking - she got loud and said “cover your nose” and was just extremely rude the whole flight. She then told me my mask was too loose, and went to get me a new one, which was the exact same brand of mask I had already been wearing. So this accomplished nothing other than giving me a bad customer experience. TV service did not work on either the flight there, or the return flight. The wifi also did not work well. 10/10 do not recommend. Not worth the price over other airlines.",-1

Jetblue reimbursed us a little money for the stuff like hotel priced toothbrushes etc. After 6 months we got a half empty luggage with only old clothing in it. Jetblue rep at first wasn't able to open the files with the store receipts of lost items, making me resend it several times, then, after I notified her that half of the stuff from the bag is missing, made me resend the receipts again, and then it took her 6 months to write me a letter, but never send it, notifying me that my claim was denied because i failed to submit the already submitted files again!

No email, no call, no text. If I haven’t tried to check in online, I would have gone to the airport for a plane that was not there. I attempted to call customer service and had a 93 minute wait.

The delays were like no other airline. From Boston to Miami 1.5 hours on Thursday. From Miami to Boston 4 hours on Sunday. They made us arrive 2 hours before the flight. We arrived at 2pm and boarded the flight at 9.10 and it left at 9.40pm. They said “Opps sorry it happens sometimes we have no control over the planes and it is stated on our website under cancellation and delays.” The “too bad, so sad approach was unacceptable” we are at their mercy. They get paid up front. All they say is “oops sorry and smirk.”",-1

My flight from Austin to New York was 3 hours delayed. Only JetBlue. Old, small and dirty airbus. Not enough space for carry on luggage and we had 5 seats. I had to check in all the bags.

Then lied to us and told us he was in the airport already and it would be 15 minutes. Half hour later we find out he is in traffic and was never here. Packed plane in the middle of a pandemic and three house later we are still just sitting here. Very disappointed in the way this has been handled!,-1
2021-04-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Meyers to Cleveland,,,,,,,1,Never again JetBlue,True,"  Worst airline. You can never be sure whether your flight will be there when it is time to travel. I booked 2 separate reservations for 5 people to go to fort Meyers and back for spring break 3 months in advance. A month later they called me and changed my 8am direct flight to 5:30pm flight connecting in Boston arriving close to midnight. I canceled this leg and bought new tickets on a different airline. The day before our return, I couldn’t check into my flight, I have the confirmation email and checked online but there was no flight going to cleveland that day. I called JetBlue, the first time and after 30 mins on hold I got disconnected, the second time, I was on hold for 1:40 minutes before someone answered and said you are confirmed for tomorrow at 6pm, then when I told him I couldn’t find the flight, he looked and said your flight was canceled a month ago and we sent you an email which I never got. With their limited schedule, they had no flights from fort Myer’s or any of the neighboring cities within 3 hours, to any city close to Cleveland for 3 more days. I paid an arm and a leg to buy 5 tickets to fly to Columbus, OH, rented a car one way to drive to cleveland because JetBlue decide to change their schedule. I never had any flight canceled with any other airline like this. Never again JetBlue.",-1

2021-04-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Detroit,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,they are not going to help any of us who got stranded,False,"  Today we were supposed to be back to our reality of work and school but Jetblue had other plans. We had an amazing trip and continued to do so until we got an email 2 hours after our connecting flight left 10 hours before it was scheduled to. We spent 4 hours on hold and 2 hours at the check in desk trying to find a solution. Our ""solution"" ended up being us flying from Orlando to Boston to stay the night in the airport and then leave in the morning for New York to then go to Detroit. Well then our flight got delayed. And delayed. Then canceled because of weather. Then booked a new flight. It was then delayed. And delayed. And again because they were looking for a pilot and flight attendants. They then waited until 1.30 in the morning to cancel it. We then had to get a hotel and try to find a new flight. Guess what, according to Jetblue we can't get home until Thursday night maybe because it would be standby. While my family slept for a few hours, I continued to be on a 3 hour hold until 5.30 in the morning for them to only tell us that we could get a flight to New York and then stay the night there and fly to Detroit on Thursday. This morning, I went straight to the airport to see if we could get a better flight while being on hold yet again for another 2.5 hours I eventually got us a flight through American Airlines for Wednesday morning that the JetBlue employee said didn't exist. So now, we wait, while missing school and work (without pay). Guess what Jetblue has to say about all of this, because it was due to ""weather"" and not the fact that they couldn't get a pilot or flight attendants they are not going to help any of us who got stranded. There is no compensation, no remorse, in fact we witnessed two employees leave their desk and never return to finish helping the customer, and if you want a refund you get a credit. Truly have never experienced anything like this from any other airline.",-1
2021-04-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,New York JFK to Miami,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,there was no consideration of the customer,False,"  The return flight was cancelled from Miami to JFK due to weather related issues. Other airlines just cancelled their flights early on in the process but Jetblue hourly delayed the flight until 3am when it was cancelled. This went on for multiple flights until they were all cancelled. They had ""no staff"" to work the flights. They were probably aware of this for hours but delayed the process at the expense of customers and their families. In the terminal there was minimal help or assistance. The staff were clueless and of no help. Worse nearby British Airways supplied food and drink to those delayed. It took customers shaming the meager staff available to offer some drink at 2.30 am. Nearly 10 hours later when any available food station had closed by 9 pm. Essentially there was no consideration of the customer. Trying to re-book was a disaster. You would think they would step-up and get re-bookings going.",-1

They worry about two years old kids not wearing the masks, but when it comes to the delayed flight, they don’t know how to handle it. They keep rescheduling the flight every hour, and after all at 3am let people know that they have no pilot available. The absolutely don’t care about people and especially kids, in fact keep rescheduling the flight to avoid paying hotel fees. I wish the choice of airlines was bigger in south direction, so I would never use them again.",-1
2021-04-11,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Westchester to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1,not even get seated together,True,"  We booked a round trip flight months ago. Upon booking, both flights were 100% empty. We paid $9 per person ($90 total) to reserve our seats. Upon checking in, we learned there was an equipment change and we were no longer together. As an accommodation, we were moved to the last row by the bathroom. For our upcoming return flight, there is another equipment change. 4 of us are now sitting up front. My 6 year older (yes, 6) is in the back. I called last night to get us back together though the flight is completely full. To make matters worse, I waited on the phone for 2 hours to speak to a manager to have our $90 of seat selection fees refunded. The only thing I was offered was a “credit” which is extremely presumptuous and assumes I will fly them again. I understand that due to COVID, demand is extremely unpredictable and the airlines are doing the best they can. However, to charge a fee for a service (seat selection) and then get bumped around the plane, and not even get seated together, and not offer a refund for the service seems completely wrong to me. This is not what I would expect as a “family friendly” airline. I’ve read other reviews about JetBlue - what happened to this airline?",-1

Checking in was also the most painful check in of my life we had to rush to make our flight. A solid three people were working to check us in and they were zero help. They wouldn’t give us our TSA pre check which we have never had an issue with before. Their covid protocols were non-existent as well. After all that, they printed out several wrong boarding passes.

2021-04-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,She did absolutely nothing to resolve my issue,False,"  I purchased a flight through JetBlue for $637.62 on Monday, April 05, 2021, and called to cancel on April 06, 2021, due to one of my family members I have been in contact with getting COVID. I purchased for an extra $50 the flight insurance that Jetblue offers that advertise ""Get your cancellation fee waived and refunded 100% of your flight"". I would like to add that there is no additional information about this insurance or any disclosures provided. They also say I can cancel online, but my option to do so was greyed out. So, I called JetBlue customer support. I waited 45 minutes for the representative to be rude and not empathetic. She had informed me that the insurance they offer is actually through a third party called Allianz and said that I would have to file a claim with them to see if I am eligible for a refund. I did this which took a lot of time. Allianz denied my claim and said they will not be refunding me. They advised me to contact JetBlue for a refund. I once again waited 45 minutes to speak with a JetBlue representative for her to tell me that there is some DLT rule where they can't refund me. She did not tell me where I could find this information, I requested proof of this and she would not provide it to me. I requested to speak to a supervisor. I waited another 10 minutes to speak with the supervisor. I told her that I would like my money refunded and not as a travel bank credit because I do not want to use their services anymore. She was the rudest supervisor I have ever spoken to. She did not empathize with me nor did she care that I was unsatisfied. She did absolutely nothing to resolve my issue. This is the second time I have had a terrible experience like this with JetBlue. I feel like I have been scammed and robbed. I feel like they would rather I fly with the possibility of giving 50 people COVID than to cancel and refund my flight.",-1

2021-04-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Chicago,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,3,Good bye JetBlue,False,"  I used to think so highly of Jet Blue, but after this most recent experience, I have two words for Jet Blue: never again. Jet Blue has recently partnered with American Airlines, something I only discovered when I made a reservation in March via the Jet Blue website and discovered that I was actually flying American both both going and coming. And it was fine. No complications. I needed to return to Chicago for Easter weekend and booked through Jet Blue again. I booked my tickets from New York to Chicago via the Jet Blue website. (I never use sites such as Priceline etc.) My ticket going from New York to Chicago was a Jet Blue flight, and the return flight is an American Airlines flight. Now here is the kicker, and the reason I will not be using Jet Blue in the future: I was *not* able to check in online 24 hours before my first flight from New York to Chicago. I repeatedly received an error message stating that the check-in could not be completed and that I should CONTACT A CREW MEMBER. I phoned Jet Blue three times on the day before my flight and asked three reps about why I could not check in. All three indicated that my ticket was in good order, confirmed, with no problems. The second service person offered to give me a seat assignment, for which I thanked her. All three told me to chrck in at an airport kiosk. And that's what I tried to do, when I arrived at the chaotically busy Jet Blue area of JFK 2 hours before my flight. I could not check in at the kiosk. I received the same error message and was instructed to locate a crew member. So I went to the Jet Blue kiosk help desk, which was extremely busy. I waited in line and finally had my turn. The woman at the service desk could not check me in. There was some kind of error with the ticket, the nature of which I was never able to discover. She said she had to call someone and asked me to step to one side while she assisted other people. Twenty minutes passed, and the forty minutes. I still had to go through security, and I was becoming worried about missing my flight. I tried to ask the woman at the desk if she would put a note on my record stating that I had arrived for my flight in case I missed my flight and had to rebook. She snapped that she was doing me a favor by making that call for me, because she could have sent me to another service desk. In her defense, that Jet Blue area was pandemonium. Finally, at 8:30 a.m., a half hour from my 9:00 a.m. flight, she handed me a boarding pass. I made it through security and arrived at the gate as the last group was boarding. I was just in time, after having arrived TWO HOURS EARLY for a domestic flight. And now, today, I am trying to check in for my return flight from Chicago to LaGuardia, and neither the Jet Blue website nor the American Airlines (partner) website recognizes my record locator or ticket number. Thus, I am yet again unableto check in for my return flight. And I am once again on hold with Jet Blue, listening once again to the worst possible hold music (c'mon Jet Blue, really?), and I've yet again been on hold for over 40 minutes.  Good bye JetBlue.",-1
2021-04-03,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Hartford to West Palm Beach,",2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,generally a terrible experience,False,"  Horrendous experience from start to finish yesterday. It started in the airport, where the two attendants handling check in sniped at every customer in front of me, complained my bag was almost overweight (it was 49.5 lbs, but to be fair limit is 50), and made the entire preboarding experience incredibly stressful. The plane was then 40 minutes late, without announcement, update or apology from staff. When boarding began, the woman at the gate got on the speaker and shouted during Mosaic boarding that she would cease all boarding entirely if people did not “clear the boarding area”. Presumably she was referring to the usual crowd milling in the hallway waiting for their zones to be called. Nobody, however, was blocking the lane whatsoever, and the single mosaic member had already boarded without any problem. When we all got on the plane, it was boiling hot and completely full- no empty seats for COVID at all. The staff was rude and unaccommodating throughout the flight. They were out of headsets entirely, and of course you can’t use modern headphones with their entertainment set up. They freely let passengers remove their masks, yet would not serve any alcohol due to the pandemic (the latter is understandable, if the former was enforced). When we arrived, they yelled again at passengers disembarking the plane. Just generally a terrible experience, and if possible I will not be flying with them again.",-1

Wanted to be socially distant so did not want to be in coach due to COVID. My seat 3A had a passenger sitting next to me. When he boarded the plane his mask was under his nose. The attendants said nothing. He then proceeded to cough the entire trip, his mask was never on and no one said anything. I could not eat because I could not remove my mask due to his constant coughing. In addition, he was coughing next to my drink and therefore could not even drink the water. Again his mask was either below his nose or not on at all. When i complained to the staff, they did nothing as they reported to me that he is a frequent flier (so what!) Also no hand sanitizer any where on the plane, and no sanitizing wipes. Food was served uncovered, it was as if COVID was over. To end this terrible flight, my suitcase was the last to come out from baggage. I had been under the impression a MINT tag assured baggage would come out first. I will now quarantine at home and get tested in 4 days. I have a feeling many of us on the flight could now be COVID positive.",-1
2021-03-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Juan,,,,,,,1,I will lose money recouping my credit,True,"  I booked flight tickets to Puerto Rico San Juan for March 24th through the 28th. Five passengers were booked on one reservation with Jet Blue . My Son, Nephew and husband all had Covid and we had to quarantine past our trip. I called the Priceline and informed them about our test and we cancelled the flights. I was informed we will get a credit to use in the future before Dec 12th 2021. I called to reschedule the flights and I was shocked about the prices I was told. How does the price rise almost 5 times with a month? I looked on line and I am seeing the very same ticket for $250-$300. This a pure scam. I will lose money recouping my credit than booking another flight and just forfeit the credit.",-1
2021-03-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Nashville,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1,the worst flying experience,True," This has been by far the worst flying experience I have ever had. I booked JetBlue vacations because they were able to get me the flight and car rental all together which I thought would be less work for me but I was wrong. To start my flight was changed numerous times, then when my flight got in late (after 11pm) there was car rental because they had closed for the night and they were supposed to be notified to keep someone past normal hours. Then I had to spend $140 to Uber to a family members house then back to the airport in the morning with a 6 month baby. Then because they changed my flight from returning Friday to returning Saturday I had to pay an extra day on top of losing the money for the first day when I came in late! Absolutely terrible I would never recommend JetBlue to anyone.",-1
2021-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Hartford,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,6 hr delay for a 2 hr flight,False,"  6 hr delay for a 2 hr flight in the middle of the night. 3 young kids. Having to sit on the ground of a dirty nasty airport. We’re told to not be upset about the delay cause at least we would get compensated for it. Of course no more mention of it during the flight so when we land at the doorway I ask the pilot and flight attendants about the compensation, do we have to call in and they said don’t worry just check your email we will send it within a week. Time passed, called 3 times, last time got a supervisor that was quick to tell me no compensation and as I was trying to explain took a few seconds to realize I had been hung up on. Worst part of all the pilot lied to my face. Way to go. Anyway never again. All the other bad reviews on here are right on point, I myself experienced things that others had. Not about the money cause it wouldn’t be much anyway, it’s about the point.",-1
2021-03-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Florida to Utah,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolutely no social distancing at all,False,"  Absolutely no social distancing at all. Refused to allow my infant to stay in his car seat despite not having anyone in the seat by my husband and I. Approached me aggressively when my son wouldn’t stop crying due to exhaustion but couldn’t sleep due to not being in his seat while moving. This airline has absolutely no respect or regard for the comfort and safety of small children. All they care about is getting their money out of you. I’ve used every airline that flies in my state with the exception of Alaskan airlines, and JetBlue takes the first place ribbon for worst airline. The cabin was dirty, staff is awful, COVID restrictions are nonexistent, representatives in customer service don’t know what the hell is going on and give you false information about COVID-probably to cover their asses if someone gets it on their plane. Overall, don’t fly JetBlue. Fly Delta, American, Southwest etc. anything but JetBlue.",-1

The first time, they cancelled my flight due to ""weather"". But by the time it was too late, they decided to activate the flight. So, ended up wasting a day. Now, completely clear skies, and the flight was delayed 2 hours, but claimed we'd arrive at the same time. Now we're past the 2 hour delay and still not boarding. No offer for any compensation for lost time. Who knows when we're actually going to leave / arrive.",-1

I was 4 minutes late and so I couldn't board and the attendant was rude in dealing with the situation and simply told me to look at my board pass, just didn't pay any attention and neither didn't even try to help or talk about.

I was also separated from my family as two of my family members made our flight. My vacation is ruined. I will never step foot on another JetBlue flight again!,-1

It was their mistake and I call customer services for the credit then they said that it was a weather issue, so we cannot do anything about it but actually it was different. In the flight, attendant announce that due to a technical issue behind the aircraft we are not able to fly. I would not recommend flying with this airline.",-1

First our plane had a dead battery. Then they said it needed a part and the part for the plane wouldn’t arrive for 5 hours and there is no guarantee this flight would even take off today. Zero connecting flight options or other flights to fort Myers. I had to drive to Newark NJ to fly to fort Myers. And this flight was delayed as well, (due to weather conditions so not entirely their fault) but then we get to fort Myers and had to wait to get off the plane for 30 minutes bc another JetBlue aircraft was in our gate?. Absolutely horrible day. Otherwise love the services available on the plane and wifi. JetBlue plz don’t do this to me again or you will lose me as a customer.",1

The agents/ flight crew are short and most of them are rude and always on a social call! They are not helpful! JetBlue only seems to care about how they can get more money out of their customers! The bigger they get the less they care about their customers! Shame on you JetBlue! You should name one of your planes 'Covetous Blue'. You are no different than any other airline! And now you want to charge people for carry-on bags during a pandemic! Well that’s brilliant.,-1
2021-02-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The worst ever,False,"  The worst ever, a family of 4 with 2 kids ages 4 and 10 and they gave us different seats all over the airplane. With covid situation going on they should put families together not separate them and seat them with strangers. Unbelievable, coming and yelling to us if u don’t seat in your seats we gone take you out of the plane.",-1

They said I would have to pay a $100 cancelation fee and they wouldn't let me reschedule.",-1
2021-02-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Sarasota,,,,,,,1,fight with them to get a full refund,False,"  I had heard good things about Jet Blue so I decided to try them out on a flight from Newark, NJ to Sarasota, FL. I booked my flight and the next day they cancelled the flight out of Newark and shifted me to another flight on another day. The new date would not work for me so I went on the app to cancel but it was going to charge me a $100 cancellation fee. So, I called and after 20 minutes on hold a person came on who was just miserable. I had to argue and fight with them to get a full refund (the flight was three months away, by the way) so that I could book with another airline. If they had just let me cancel without a fight I wouldn’t have held a grudge but the fact that they made me fight and get angry with them on the phone has caused me to decide never to bother with Jetblue again. I’d rather book another airline that doesn’t make things as difficult as possible for it’s customers.",-1

I was with 2 others without armrest because the guy next to me hogged my space while my daughter was with another stranger.

First they did not block middle seats, just did for a short period of time, well, still decide to give them a shot, and booked an international flight with my family. They said airplanes will be no more than 75% capacity, they lie, full flight back and forth to Cancun. Also the plane was very old/dated, the screens without movies just TV, on an international flight!, and food, forget it, but I already know that. Will try to avoid at all costs, this airline, too bad, now only choice is Delta, that really care about passengers health and is the only airline who still blocked middle seats.",-1
2021-01-04,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Richmond,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,put other airlines to shame,False,"  Thank you Jetblue for offering non stop service to/from Richmond, Virginia to Las Vegas. We fly a lot, but not often on Jetblue, due to routes. Your service and planes put other airlines to shame. I absolutely hate flying with your competitors but have to because of certain routing. We have plenty of options from Richmond, Virginia to head north or south and LOVE that you've added 2 Western direct destinations (Vegas and LA). Would love to see future direct flights to Colorado and Utah. Our return flight was delayed an hour but we knew about the delay the day before when we checked in. Delays happen and really appreciated Jetblue being proactive and notifying of us early. That's great service! Please add Salt Lake City and Denver to your direct schedule from Richmond, pretty please?",1

There was a $30 hidden daily fee for the hotel in Orlando that was never disclosed and when I called Jetblue customer service they told me it's because the used a 3rd party vender for their website and the fee wasn't disclosed properly and they will not refund my money. I also got charged $45 for a small carry on item and they wouldn't refund that money either. Very poor service, please watch out for this airline.",-1
2021-01-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2,no social distancing on the flight,True," I have been loyally flying with Jetblue because of their dedication to customer service and great flight experience as well as their great handling of flying during a pandemic. Yesterday’s flight changed all of that. My partner and I, who have been socially distancing and extremely cautious and only exposed to each other, were placed in middle seats in 2 separate rows, both seated next to strangers. There was no social distancing on the flight, nor any cautionary measures like disinfecting and cleaning during the flight. We had asked to be seated next to each other at least, a request that was ignored 3 times. And after all of that, when I called customer service to complain, after 2 hours on hold waiting for the supervisor, I was told that Jetblue’s only responsibility was, and I quote, “to get customers from A to B, that’s it.” In other words, customer comfort and safety is of no concern to the supervisor. I am extremely disappointed in Jetblue and their handling of customer safety during a pandemic.",-1
2020-12-28,0.9,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Salt Lake City to Ft Lauderdale,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,airline is definitely worth the value,True," Before the trip even started, we had to call and make changes with customer service. The agent was very kind and made all the changes that we requested. Bag drop-off went smoothly, except for a few technological glitches. Boarding was slightly delayed due to the inbound delay, however, Even More Space did have priority boarding. Once onboard the aircraft, there was slight confusion about seating which caused more delays. We ended up departing 15 minutes behind schedule. The Even More Space seat provided a lot more legroom and it was much more comfortable. The snack service seemed unaltered by the virus - all passengers could choose between cheez-its and cookies as well as a large variety of drinks from the Pepsi company. JetBlue provided neck pillows, blankets, and headphones for sale. The seatback entertainment screen provided a large variety of shows and movies as well as a detailed flight map. The wifi was fast and free for the entire flight, for all passengers. We landed on time. The crew took great care of us. The only issue was that the baggage took about 30 minutes to arrive. The airline is definitely worth the value, especially considering that Even More Space gets you the same amount of legroom as other airlines' first-class cabins, and priority boarding and security, at only 70 extra dollars.",1
2020-12-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,little communication from the staff,False,  There was very little communication from the staff.

2020-12-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Tampa,4.0,,2.0,,1.0,3.0,3,their attitude is laissez faire,True,"  This is a tough time to fly and I decided to do it after very careful research and quarantine. JetBlue claims to be about safety but their attitude is laissez faire. They ask if one has tested positive for COVID in the last week but does not ask if one has actually been tested. Lots of folks on the plane were careless about masking and the stewards made no announcements to remind people of safety. Please if you are unsure about flying, then don't fly. If you do fly, please get a KN95 mask and a face shield, and be prepared to tell those around you (and they may seat someone next to you) to please mask up.",-1
2020-12-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Jamaica,,,,,,,1,I will never fly with them,True,"  JetBlue reviewed my husband and I vacation we waited months to go to. They cancelled our 11:30am a day before and then tried to “accommodate” us by putting us on a flight that leaves the day After with a 12hr layover in Boston. That’s the only option we were given. Understandable there was warnings of a storm , but they could of delayed the flight like every other Airline did at JFK. I will never fly with them, I will just stick to Delta because they never disappoint and are Always accommodating.",-1
2020-12-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to New York JFK,2.0,,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2,I’m very disappointed by this airline!,True," I’m very disappointed by this airline! We are during such a critical time and they aren’t doing anything to make it safer. Apparently half of the seats on the plane were marked as an upgrade seat! Why? So people will pay extra $100 to seat in exactly similar seat as the economy but they might won’t have much people next to them. Therefore, where I’m sitting the plane is completely full! Front back and both sides of my seats while half of the seats at the upgrade area is completely empty! I asked the flight attendant if I’m able to switch my seat to one of the empty rows and he decline my request. It’s a shame. And I’m really hoping that the government will do something regarding this matter! How come half of the plane is empty while the second half is completely full. I’m upset about JetBlue and will never be back!",-1
2020-12-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Austin,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,Awful customer service,True,"  Awful customer service. Booked seat 8C 2 months in advance and checked in with that seat but when I arrived at gate was told I was bumped to middle seat at back of plane 27B. Did not care and told me I needed to pay to get back to 8C. Entire front section was open but refused to let people upgrade. Instead they stuffed everyone in the back (no care for COVID risk). Horrible, condescending, unhelpful staff at Newark. Would not fly.",-1
2020-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Aruba,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Communication is terrible with this airline,False,"  This is and will be the very last time I ever fly Jetblue. This is the 2nd time they have ruined a vacation for my family. They changed the flight day, not the time, the day to a day before we were supposed to leave. I showed up to the airport and looked like a fool today when I was told the flight was the day before the scheduled time. Now our hotel reservation is messed up. There's no other flights available today so we must go home and figure this out. I didn't get an email the day prior when we ""missed"" our flight. That would have been nice so I could have addressed this before we showed up like clowns. Communication is terrible with this airline, always has been. I will pay double and fly Delta for the rest of my life. I hope this email will prevent as many customers as possible from getting their vacation plans ruined by Jetblue.",-1
2020-11-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Boston,,,,,,1.0,1,never be flying Jetblue again,True,  I will absolutely never be flying Jetblue again. This is the second time that the flight time was changed without email. Flight 992. I am now stuck in the airport until 3:00. My flight to and from my destination was changed without notification and due to that both trips made me waste 12 hours in an airport during a pandemic. This is disgusting. I arrived at the airport today for my flight to Boston at 9:20 and was directed to wait in line when I was urging them I needed to make my flight. I was forced to go to a kiosk that I don’t know how to work efficiently and then upon completion - “two minutes past acceptable time”. Requested to speak to the manager and she said there was nothing she could do without even picking up the phone to try and assist. Did the absolutely minimum to help and her team essentially forced me to miss my flight. No compensation was offered either just deal with the companies lack of communication.,-1

My mom, a 72 years old lady did her return to Bogotá, with an electric wheelchair, a portable oxigen machine and suitcases. She had a safe and great return home. Thanks to the help and assistance she received. We are very thankful for efforts and service from JetBlue and at the airport.",1
2020-10-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to San Juan,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2,no social distancing for the customers,True,"  There was no social distancing for the customers. Everyone was sitting next to each other but for the flight crew the airline has a whole row in front, or behind where the flight attendants seat at. A whole row where not one person can even think of seating at. I took it upon myself to ask the flight attendant seating down if I could seat in one of those seat because they were empty or better yet, off limits to the customers and she replied, with an attitude, ""Excuse me sir! You are not  allowed to seat there due to Social Distancing guidelines and/or protocol for our own protection"" When other people heard what she said, one or two other people said ""what about our protection?"" "" what about us?"" is what I heard in the background. Then the flight attendant, said, if you cause any problems because of this issue you can be banned frmo traveling with Jet Blue in the future. I just asked a question to seat where the seats where empty. Anyways, I don't think is fair for the customers to be exposed and not the flight attendants or crew.",-1
2020-10-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to San Juan,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1,no social distancing whatsoever,False,"  There is no social distancing whatsoever. I was so surprised that with other airlines no matter the price you pay for the ticket, the administration cares about their customers health. With JetBlue there is no social distancing being practiced, and the only ones who are being socially distanced are the flight attendants. The row or rows that are in front or behind JetBlue's flight attendants are off limits to protect them with social distancing against the rest of the flight crew. I don't see that as right at all. Protect the flight attendants with social distancing but not the crew? Looks so selfish from their part. Something other airlines don't do. So, it looks like they say, ""well let's sell our tickets for cheap, or look cheap so that way the customers don't complain when they see there is no social distancing""! Shame on you Jet Blue! Too bad I have to fly back to JFK with JetBlue! If not I would've chosen a different airline like Delta, or Southwest which leave an empty seat between seats. The way it's supposed to be.",-1
2020-10-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,New York to San Francisco,3.0,,4.0,,,2.0,1,packed in surrounding rows,True,"  I was a advid jet blue frequent flyer but with the pandemic and this situation I will rethink my next flight. I just boarded my flight to find out JetBlue no longer blocks seats to allow for social distancing. I'm appalled I was not notified ahead of time while booking my flight and again when I checked in. My row with me in it made it full. It was packed in surrounding rows, back and front side to side. I asked to be moved to a seat in a row that is ""open"" and ended up in back row. That's fine but I specifically paid extra to select my aisle seat under the impression middle seat was blocked. Jet blue took my money and ran with it",-1
2020-10-16,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Los Angeles,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,it’s always been a pleasure to fly on Jetblue,True," As usual it’s always been a pleasure to fly on Jetblue even in the middle of a pandemic. Flew last night from New York to Los Angeles and everything went pretty well. The airport was empty so it was pretty much a breeze to go through security. We boarded on time and ever middle seat was empty. The only problem yesterday was the fact that a young couple refused to wear their masks properly and it took about half an hour to remove them from the aircraft so we were delayed by half hour. In regards to the flight ten minutes after takeoff a snack bag with cookies, water and cheese it’s was provided. Another one provided about hour and a half prior to landing and in between both a bottle of water was provided as well. Unfortunately service was quite robotic but probably due to the pandemic so there wasn’t much interaction with the crew aside from that. I had a whole row to myself so that was very very comforting considering the flight was “full”. Wifi worked perfectly and as usual there’s a good selection of movies and shows plus direct tv.",1
2020-10-01,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Santiago,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,very disappointed in Jetblue,False,"  I'm very disappointed in Jetblue. They were completely dishonest with me about their cancelation policy, flat out lying about how long credits would last. When I had to cancel a flight due to the pandemic they gave me my money back in credits, but they expired way before they were supposed to. Not to mention once a bag of mine was damaged and when I asked to be sent a new one (ordered it and everything) suddenly they decided to give me credits instead, which obviously expired before they could’ve possibly been useful.",-1

First of all very rude flight attendants, in the beginning of the boarding, I was drinking water and had my mask under my nose, same for my husband, he came to us and said to put the mask over our nose, than he said if there is a problem with that to let him know now, so we can leave the plane before they close the doors! This is just ridiculous.",-1

Our flight was delayed because of weather and aircraft issues, staff assured us that our connecting flight would still be waiting upon our arrival. When we arrived they looked at us as if they never said that. There were 15 people on this flight that need the connecting flight and JetBlue says well we will put you on Spirit Airlines at 9pm and give you lunch and dinner vouchers. I will never ever fly with them again.",-1
2020-08-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Long beach,,,,,,,1,they can’t give it back,False, I had canceled my flight due to COVID. I have a $400.00 credit that will expire. Jetblue is no longer flying the route that I take and have for years so I wanted my money back so I don’t lose it but they say they can’t give it back. All airlines are giving their passengers their money back with no cancellation fees except JetBlue only credit for practically no flights.,-1
2020-08-21,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Boston,,,,,,,1,it should come directly back to me,True," Previously, when I cancelled flights, I get a proper refund for my flight. Now, they do the Jetblue bank account. I think this is ridiculous. I booked a flight out almost 3 weeks prior for Sep 4th. 3 days ago, I cancelled said flight, still over 2 weeks away from the flight and instead of refunding to my bank account, it is still kept by JetBlue. I'm glad the flight was cheap enough that it didn't cause a major detriment to my pocket, but I still think that because I cancelled so far away from the flight that it should come directly back to me.",-1

There were snack boxes, flight was on time and the crew was nice. Everything was nice and clean and the seats were very comfortable. This is the new refurbished cabin and this isn't one of JetBlue's mint A321's. The service was good in the airport and the boarding was quick, even for non-speedy boarding passengers. Overall, Jetblue is a really good airline.",1
2020-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,1.0,1,haggle over every refund request,False," We cancelled a flight due to COVID 19 and requested a refund. Unfortunately each passenger had a true blue account, so the credit went to them and although I had paid for all the airfare, Jet Blue refused to refund the total airfare directly to me. Their website seldom addresses my concerns, which the necessitates a phone call. The wait times have always been long, with non-stop messages referring me back to the useless website rather than speaking to a real person. Refunds for six passengers requires 4-6 weeks each! Jet Blue exemplifies the worst customer service I've ever experienced!  Rather than valuing loyal repeat customers, they haggle over every refund request. These reviews demonstrate irate passengers who will never again fly with JB.",-1
2020-06-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Long Beach to New York,,,,,,,1,JetBlue should be utterly ashamed,False,"  JetBlue  talk about not doing cancellation fees due to COVID, but all they offer is a travel voucher and then jack up their prices. I paid $1700 for tickets for my family to NY. Obviously that isn't happening. I cancelled and they offered a travel voucher, so I figured I'd look ahead to another trip we wanted to take to Nashville. Well, the same exact trip that I can get on most other airlines for about $600 round trip for 5 people is about $2200 on Jet Blue. Almost quadruple the price. I thought it was a mistake and so a checked a bunch of other trips and compared. Nope, no mistake. They have completely jacked up their prices because they know that a ton of people have vouchers they must use. I will never fly on their airline. That is $1700 that I can never get back and we saved up for almost a year to buy those tickets. JetBlue should be utterly ashamed that they are exploited a pandemic like COVID to try and recoup their losses at our expense.",-1
2020-05-19,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Newark,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,cabin crews are friendly,True,"  JetBlue was an incredible experience. Unlimited snacks and drinks, all the entertainment you could wish for on a large touchscreen. My favorite thing about JetBlue is that they offer free WiFi on all of their flights. They also have the best legroom, 34 inches in some airplanes. Everything on JetBlue is included in the price of your ticket (except for checked bags and fresh meals) On all of my past JetBlue flights I have to the new Airbus A320 interior. It is really nice and a step up from their old planes. I much prefer to fly JetBlue on the route from FLL or PBI to EWR instead of United or Spirit. JetBlue is so consistent and the cabin crews are friendly. The only recommendation I have when flying them is to avoid row 27, because from what I saw, there was a missing window.",1
2020-04-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Ft Myers,,,,,,,1,not giving refunds,False,"  Washington to Ft Myers. I had to cancel a flight booked on 4/13/2019 in the amount of $2,141 due to the fact that my son wouldn't be able to graduate until 4/2020. I had asked when cancelled for a refund and was told no and given a JetBlue Travel voucher The voucher was good for 1 year, it was my intend to use it in 2020 for this years graduation (which by the way was also cancelled). With the Coronavirus I have put off booking a flight. I appreciate the fact that my voucher was extended until 12/31/2020 but I'm not flying anytime soon or in the near future. There is no guarantee that the virus will be gone by 12/31/2020 or they will have a vaccine. I don't want a extension on a voucher I want my refund. $2,141 may not be a lot of money to JetBlue but it is to us. I had originally planned to used the voucher when I found out the graduation date. I think that is a disgrace that with the country being in a pandemic and people on hard time that JetBlue is taking advantage of keeping customers money and not giving refunds, especially after asking both last last year and now. JetBlue is not customer driven, its pretty obvious they only care about making money. When others are reaching out to help people during these trouble time JetBlue plans to make out on it The government is giving they people money to help with these trouble time but Not JetBlue. I will never book anything with them again they are the worst!",-1

What I am reviewing is the forethought to extend the deadline for using a JetBlue credit. I was on the hunt for how to ask if I could and the site addressed it first thing. Thank you.

I flight with JetBlue very frequently and I have always been very happy with your airline in every way. I understand that situations might appear that are out of your control, but I am extremely disappointed at the way the airline handled it. For starters, I was not informed at any moment that the flight was delayed by any of your representatives even though they were aware of what was happening, and the information screens displayed that everything was normal with the flight. I went through security only to find no plane there and nobody at the gate at the time of the boarding to tell us what was going on. I had to buy internet cards just to go online and find out what was going on, I even had to tell some of the people that were waiting with me because they had no idea what was going on and had no money to buy internet. Nobody, including the representatives you employ, approached us at any point with information or updates of the situation. I had to ask my friend to call the airline form Orlando to find out the cause of the problem because it did not show this information online. I had no money left from my trip, so I couldn't even get lunch and no vouchers were given to us. I didn't eat anything since 7 am (since I had to be early at the airport form my supposed departure time) until 4 pm when I got home. I had to take an Uber home since the person that was going to pick me up had to go to work and couldn't pick me up. And on top of that, your delay made me late for work.",-1

Taking advantage of pandemic situation! I had to change the dates of my flight.

They claim that they were forced to which is a lie. Curacao prohibited new visitors but people were allowed to leave. American Airlines continued to operate their flights in and out of Curacao and are still doing so as of today. Jetblue abandoned everyone who was to leave on their flights. Jetblue did not help us get another flight out. Completely unconscionable behavior and total disregard for the well being of their customers. Luckily on my own I was able to book a ticket on American and leave albeit for thousands of dollars. As icing on the cake, they have refused to issue me a refund and as further icing, customer service gave me an attitude when a refund was requested. Simply unbelievable.",-1

Contacted JetBlue and was told my flight was cancelled and they could not fly me home until April 1, 2020. Told them I could not stay on the island until April I was told they could not fly because the Aruba goverment would not allow them to. When I informed them that United, Delta and AA were still flying into Aruba to get people home, I was told I should fly with one of those Airlines.

2020-03-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Palm Beach to New York,,,,,,,1,never fly JetBlue again,False,"  Palm Beach to New York. I made a round trip reservation to attend my nephew's wedding in NYC for April 4. As we all know the nation is suffering the Coronavirus pandemic. JetBlue advertises no cancelation fees, etc. due to this. That's a lie! After spending a considerable amount of time waiting to speak with a representative I was informed that is not the case - I would be receiving a credit that needed to be used within 1 year or lose it! My nephew will have a difficult time making those arrangements - Church, reception hall on top of countless other weddings cancelled and probably won't be able to do that in time. So it's either 2 solutions - 1) JetBlue goes bankrupt, no credit. 2) Taxpayer bailout while you screw the taxpayer by lying about refunds. The fact that they would due this to a senior citizen is a direct reflection on the character of the airline.  My intention is to never fly JetBlue again and I warn you to do the same.",-1
2020-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Boston, MA to Fort Myers, FL",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,we were stuck at the airport for an extra 6 hours,False,"  My wife and I booked a flight from Logan Airport in Boston to Fort Myers. We planned to travel with our toddler and infant. We arrived at the airport early, struggled through a thorough and time consuming search at the security check, and made it to the JetBlue terminal with 20 minutes to kill before boarding started. It was a little after 8 am, so we went to Dunkin Donuts and grabbed some food and drinks for us and the kids. As we traveled through the JetBlue terminal, we noticed a kids' play area so, after we got our food, we returned there and put down our things. We fed both kids, changed their diapers, and went to the bathroom. As we were there, we heard a number of announcements over the loud speaker but none pertaining to our flight. After we got everyone squared away and ready for the flight, we walked to our gate and arrived there at 9.07. We were told that the door closed at 9.05. We asked if there was any way they could let us on the flight, but they turned us away. Was it our fault for not being there on time? Absolutely. We could make a number of excuses for ourselves, but, ultimately, it was on us to be there before the door closed. However, JetBlue did not make any announcements in the kids' area, which is in their own terminal. My wife and I were paying attention to the announcements and we would have heard the call for final boarding had they played it in there. In the end, we were stuck at the airport for an extra 6 hours, which was very difficult, to say the least. Not a fun experience. The way we were treated by JetBlue employees was less than pleasant, too. So, next time, I'll fly with another airline (and never again with two kids under 2).",-1

The flight prices are similar if not more expensive than Southwest and unlike Southwest where there are no cancellation or change fees, JetBlue charges anywhere from $75-$200 for changing or cancelling a flight. You also have to purchase the more expensive flights in order to be eligible to change or cancel a flight and will be given a travel credit unless you purchase the most expensive flight option. My flights are frequently delayed (most recently by 3 hours) and when I traveled long distance I had to pay to choose my seat (and no not for upgraded Extra Comfort seats) on top of the airfare which I didn’t understand, if I’m paying for airfare shouldn't my seat be included unless I’m paying for upgraded seating? Overall I have chosen to avoid JetBlue flights at all costs unless there’s an emergency and they have the only flight available I have zero intentions of flying JetBlue again.",-1

I flew with JetBlue 2 months ago, they lost my suitcase and have still yet to find it. Their way of compensation was to offer awful customer service, and a $700.00 pay out. I wouldn't be so annoyed if they had the decency to pretend like they care about their customers but they do not. I had to engage in almost all communication I had with them. I was told numerous times by JetBLue customer service representatives that the issue would be handled and a representative would reach out. 9/10 times no one would reach out and in turn I would have to call 2 or 3 times just to get an answer as to what would happen with my personal belongings.

The excuse given was that there was a passenger emergency and they had to stop in Bahamas. There were actually two flights leaving from Puerto Rico to Orlando, the other flight was supposed to leave at 9:45 pm. The excuse was that this flight in turn had to go to Bahamas, to pick up the crew from the other flight! This is not the first time Jetblue gives excuses as ridiculous as this one.

I am a mosaic member of jetblue because I have to fly a ton of mile for work and i often have to use them on the east coast. The issue I have with them is their lack of customer service at the airports they support. Today I am in Portland Oregon and I made the mistake of showing up 3 hours early for a flight. Yes, that's early, but I just want to check my bags, eat something and get home to Boston MA and I am taking the red eye at 900. Turns out that they do not man their counters here at the airport until the last minute and there is nothing I can do with my bags to get through to a decent place to eat. Mosaic customer service got confused and after explaining to them where I was repeatedly, they told me there is nothing they could do. So here I am, stuck with my bags until they decide to show up and let me check them.

I begged her to help me and she didn’t even bother to look at me or check.

There was one person at the booth who couldn’t go to get it for me and had to “radio it in.” 20 minutes later my sweater arrives. Off to a great vacation so far. Mind you I am traveling with a 2 year old and there was no stroller when I got to the gate. Yet there were 15 wheel chairs waiting outside of the plane. I went down to baggage claim to get the stroller as in past flights when it wasn’t at the gate it was taken to baggage claim. I finally get to baggage claim and no stroller. When I checked with JetBlue to see where it was they said I was supposed to claim it at the gate. I told them it wasn’t there. I was then told that another flight was boarding and that I’d have to wait up to an hour for them to bring it down! Do yourself a favor and do not fly with this airline!,-1

Cabin crew wasn't able to help. Emailed and asked for a refund of the 10 month old seat (felt like that was the least they could do for both giving me an unusable seat and the stress caused). They offered me a $50 credit. that's not very useful when I pay for seat selection, don't get the seat, and receive this response ""we do reserve the right to change a customer's seat for any reason.""

That’s just for starters, come the day we’re leaving. Funny enough another delay sent out (by email the least they could do). We returned our rental by this time and had someone bring us to the airport, but with the delay we had to find another ride. We get to the airport and they don’t allow us to check our bags, about 20 minutes before the flight they changed the delay from 6:38AM to 6:06 blindsiding all the passengers. Everyone was very upset. Gave us the worst options putting the balm on the passengers at check-in. All anyone wanted to do was get home for the new year. Due to the changes that were made people had to stay in the DR and take other flights. The passengers were all very upset including the folks that had stay for the new year. I think we can all agree we would much rather have the customer service versus the direct fight. Terrible and would not recommend.",-1

One of the flight attendants was complaining the entire flight about how she was being forced to work 24 hours as she was on call. For the second flight she was not working just speaking loudly as we were all trying to sleep. My 2 year old was crying because we kept needing to wake him up for all of the transitions.

They were amazing, from the ease on and off the flight, the IFE consoles allow you to choose from a large catalogue of movie or cable channels. They offered premium beverage and food choices. The leg room and overhead room for those not checking luggage was fantastic.",1

2019-12-24,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,disgraceful customer service,True,"  Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. This by far was one of the best example of disgraceful customer service experience I have ever encountered in all my years of traveling. I got to the airport at 12:30 with my daughter excitedly anticipating attending a family event that we all looked forward to only to find out that the flight was delayed. It was only from 3 to 5:00 ish so not too bad we hoped, we would arrive about 7:00, the event started at 6:00, so we would be an hour to hour an half late, so I thought. After that the emails came indicating that the flight was delayed due ""parts needing to be changed on the flight"", we all found out later, through several versions of what really happened that, the plane was not a part issue but was diverted to Newark, because apparently higher paying passengers were more of a priority than those in ATL. Five more emails later, flight was delayed til 8:30pm which turned out to be a 9:05pm departure arriving in Fort Lauderdale after 11:01 and before we were able to get our checked bags, we arrived at home 12:20 am. At the airport in ATL we were given a slice of cold pizza and a drink and told we be reimbursed according to their bill of rights and given a voucher of $250 per person. I have received a voucher for $150 and told that there was nothing else they could do. The fact that we had missed our family party was met with very little empathy. This is so infuriating!",-1
2019-12-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,,,,,,,1,would not exchange the ticket,True,"  Orlando to Newark. We made a mistake on a flight reservation. We booked a flight from Orlando to Newark (over $150) on the wrong date with no protection. We have never made this mistake before. As a courtesy, customer service would not exchange the ticket for another ticket with the actual correct date and protection added ""because the ticket was booked through JetBlue online and not through JetBlue over the phone."" JetBlue is JetBlue. That is such a money grab excuse. I get the whole no protection part, but there was supposed to be protection. It was just booked wrong and it was a mistake. Where is the exceptional customer service? I always fly JetBlue, have a TrueBlue Mastercard, never complain, and stick it out through the many delays I've been in, not to mention the time the plane started smoking up in the air and we had to turn around, land, get on another jet, just to get back to NJ. I simply asked that a total of $150 be returned to me and then used to purchase an accurate ticket and they couldn't do that? Really? I think it's time that I switch airlines. Over the last two years, I've flown back and forth from NJ to FL and this is what I get in return? I've stuck by JetBlue for a while and would continue to do so, but not like this. This is wrong.",-1

It all started with an email from Jetblue stating that our flight was delayed. At the airport, inflight crew was 40 min late. We ended boarding 2.5 hrs late. But what really shocked me was all the dogs on the airplane. Never had I seen this in a flight! Not only the quantity but the annoyance of said issues. This lady did not want to leave the flight even after the supervisor told her the dog could not be out on the aisle because of liability issues. They just let her on even with the issue of her about 80lbs dog blocking the aisle for us on the way to the restroom and snack area. We had to literally jump over the dog. My husband and my sons' allergies started up and continued all through the night because of the pet. First and last time I will be on Jetblue, never again! Really upsetting!.",-1

I got charged 180 dollars for one bag. It was overweight by 8lbs. I'm ok paying an extra fee but to be told that it would only cost me 150 then to be charged an additional 30 is ridiculous. From checkin to speaking to a manager I was given misleading information. Not only that but if you go to their website it doesn't specifically say that they will charge you an additional 30 only that an overweight bag will cost 150. Honestly never fly them unless you want to be scammed and nickled and dimed for every little thing. The icing on the cake was when the manager offered me a 30dollar travel voucher but asserted that she couldn't refund me the 30. Never ever flying Jetblue again!,-1

Where to begin, 9.40 pm flight was delayed 3 times before finally being cancelled at 3 am. They gave 3 different reasons for the the delay and then they changed my flight to a different airport with a stop in Boston getting home a day later. This was the worst experience I've ever had. Contacted JetBlue after to get credit and they gave me $50, what a joke, would never fly again. Worst customer service.",-1

I have never written a bad review on any airline before, I have flown with at least 10 airlines internationally, and domestically. That has changed drastically because of this airline. My family and I had never flown with this airline before, but it was cheaper by a landsline so we decided to try it out. About a month later another family member was interested in going so we went ahead and booked her on the same flight since there were still availabilities. Fast forward a week before our departure, my aunt was horribly injured, and she's 84 years old. I call the airline and the woman I spoke with was adamant that because it was a medical excuse we would receive a full refund as long as we turned in a doctor's note. Now, before I even start on how they treated the refund, I would like to talk on my personal interaction on the airline. This alone would have spurred me to write a review even without the second part of our dealings. So our first flight gets delayed one hour, then 45 minutes, then another 45, and we are counting the minutes to when we would land because our second flight to leave the country was 3 hours after our first flight should have landed. Now, I have traveled around the world numerous times, I lived abroad so I have dealt with my fair share of delays. But, and I emphasize the but, the airline always contacted the next flights when dealing with delays in order to work with everyone's schedules. I have had many airlines delay the next flight for me enough that passengers wouldn't miss the flight going out. So coming off this rant, we miss the next flight, by 5 minutes. Do they call ahead and delay the next flight 30 minutes knowing there were connections? No. Now, that wouldn't even be a big deal normally because they get you on the next flight, but they only had one a day to Ecuador. So why did they not delay the flight knowing now they were going to have to put up multiple people in hotel rooms if they did not? Do not ask me, I sure do not know! We have to wait around an hour for a shuttle to take us to a hotel, then got next day to sit around in the airport for 9 hours. Pretty much missing a full day of work and a full day of vacation. They do not give a meal on an international flight, and you have to pay for any extras such as earphones, pillows, blankets, etc. which I have never seen before. Fast forward, fly back into the states and once again have to sit around and wait for 9 hours again! They must really love the number nine! When booking the next flight out (once they made us miss our second flight) the man behind the desk had the gall to ask me why we missed the flight because only if it was their fault would they put us in a hotel. Only if it was their fault. Then he laughed and said ""how lucky we were"" because there were only 3 seats on the flight the next day (meaning if there weren't we would have been stranded another day? I definitely did not feel lucky!) So on top of that all they refuse to issue me a refund back on my card even though we have a doctor's note because we canceled the flight. It does not matter that it was medically necessary, we will only receive credit with a cancelation fee.",-1
2019-12-10,0.3,Business,Premium Economy,West Palm Beach to Boston,3.0,,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3,My patience is worn out,True,"  West Palm Beach to Boston. I am a Mosiac Jet Blue business traveler and paid $70 to upgrade to the first row aisle seat. I was the 5th person to board the flight and the overhead compartment above my seat was already full. The flight attendant stated that’s my stuff in the compartment and you will have to find another place to store your roll on bag. What, I paid $70 for an upgrade only to learn the flight attendants belongings are a higher storage priority at the front of the bus, versus passengers who paid to upgrade? Why don’t they store their luggage at the back of the plane? Moral to my story is despite being a Mosiac member, early boarding, and paying for a ‘business class seat’, it doesn’t matter so it is pointless to upgrade! I’m already qualified for Mosiac in 2020. However, I’m going to give seriously consideration another airline for my personal and business travels. This is the second time I experienced this issue. My patience is worn out!",-1

I am having my second extended delay with them in two weeks. The previous issue was a mechanical issue and they never told us the truth on the plan or the timing for resolution. They just lied to us. Today they have a 2 hour delay ( costing me money) as they are sourcing our plane ( we are supposed to be taking off at 9:20) out of Puerto Rico- a 4 hour distance from Boston. That is just terrible logistics. The plane should have arrived overnight. Not this morning.,-1

I have never experienced this type of delay before, on any airline. As there was a snow issue early in the morning, I checked my departure time before I drove an hour to Boston Logan. Upon arriving in Boston, my flight departure time went from 7:41 pm to 11:00pm. I stopped by JetBlue customer service desk and was told that the airplane was actually there at Boston Logan but was leaving for Nashville instead, and then coming back later. Over the next 8 hours, my departure time changed 6 additional times. 11:00pm 12:00am 11:53pm 1:00am 1:46am 2:10am There were no reasons provided. No information at all. We boarded at 2:10am and sat at gate until just after 2:30am when pilot finally announced they had resolved mechanical issue and we departed. Again no communication. The flight was roughly half-full. There was an older gentleman that asked if he could move to an empty seat with more room and was told that he would be charged to upgrade his seat. This, after waiting in a terminal for 8+ hours, on a half-full flight. Needless to say, there were some very irate passengers. JetBlue certainly knew they were going to use this plane for another reason and therefore they should have cancelled this flight to FLL and everyone could have re-booked and not spent 8+ hours waiting to see if the flight was really happening. I certainly will think twice about flying JetBlue in the future.",-1
2019-12-08,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Burbank,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,An amazing flight,True,"  An amazing flight!  There was pretty much only 1 flight attendant running the show this whole flight but was the best I have ever seen. She did everything with a smile. She was sharing a portable charger with a child in front of me so he could do homework. She made everyone feel so comfortable on the plane. She welcomed passengers to take as many snacks as they wanted from the snack basket. Unfortunately we had to gate check our bags as all overhead compartments were full. She was able to make it that we could pick out bags up at the gate and we could have them faster. The plane was nice with free wifi (not fast but it was free), lots of legroom, comfortable seats, and live tv (which was a bit outdated but you could also use your own device).",1
2019-12-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Chicago,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,2,astounded and furious,True,"  New York JFK to Chicago. I had the most bizarre episode flying from JFK to ORD today on JetBlue flight #105. The gate agent said the baggage bins were full and then tagged my bag to Chicago and said at the end of the jetway a baggage person at the door of the plane would take it. When I arrived at the end of the jetway, the baggage man told me to go downstairs with my bag. He didn't take my bag as normal. At the bottom on the tarmac, I asked some man what and where am I am to go and do with my bag. The man kept telling me to follow the green line. There was a man in the opening at the rear of my plane and I asked him several times what am I suppose to do. He finally said climb up to give him my bag. He did not come down to take my bag. What service is this? Is this the way JetBlue treats its passenger? This has never happened to me on any airline and if your employees don't want to do their jobs then fire them. If not, I think I should fly another airline. I am astounded and furious! Attached are my boarding pass and the tarmac's green line.",-1

My last 4 or 5 travel with JetBlue has been nothing but delays and I mean significant delays. This is my 5th delay, the 4th delay for the in less than 4 months. I am voicing my frustration because it is very heartbreaking and above that you guys delay the flights and as not even as much as a $20 meal voucher is offered to feed me while I waiting for 8, 9 hours. TIt's a sleazy practice to tell people the flight is going to be that time when they know before hand that there is no Airbus available. And the excuse remains the same, air crew member was late. That's messed up. If I am late. I get no refund or nothing, so why when it's the company's fault, not the elements, I get nothing but rude customer service reps and so called supervisors.",-1
2019-12-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to New York,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,frustrating and worst experience,False,"  I had an international flight from Boston to Hyderabad via New York connecting through Jetblue. My flight from Boston was delayed, it was to take off at 8 but it took off at 9:45 and my flight from New York to Hyderabad was via Emirates which was departing at 11 and because jetblue delayed my 2017 flight my Emirates flight was missed. As I was in Boston airport and I got to know there was a delay I went to a jetblue crew member and asked, they were like its okay flight will leave at 9 and then as soon as you get down you can run towards your international flight. But I reached New York at 10:50 and I missed my flight. When I went to jetblue they were so irresponsible, after lot of talk they rescheduled my flight for after 24 hours, my whole day got wasted and they didn't even help me find my baggage I had to roam between terminal 4 and 5 for my bags, and the hotel they gave me i had to checkout at 2PM though my flight was at 11PM and i had to wait at the airport for the remaining time. The next day when I am at the airport checking in for Etihad they told I don't have a reservation I had to go all the way to terminal 5 from terminal 4 to reconfirm with jetblue, and jetblue casually told they didn't confirm my reservation (Can you believe it after 24 hours of delay and 6 hours of wait at airport I get to know jetblue didn't even confirm my rebooking). I had to wait there for 25 minutes to get my ticket confirmed and then I went back to terminal 4 and boarded. My hassle wasn't finished yet ... after going to Hyderabad during my vacation I get to know that my return ticket through Emirates was cancelled because Jet Blue did not inform them about my rebooking. I had to explain Emirates people what my situation was and then after all the talking they rebooked my flight but I have to wait 48 hours still to get a confirmation on my ticket. A frustrating and worst experience!",-1

The flight kept getting delayed until 3:25am of the 3rd and after that it got cancelled. It was because of weather so not the airline´s fault. They made us wait on a line for hours and once you got to the front all they said was they couldn´t do anything and we should call 1-800-jetblue. After waiting for another hour on hold, the costumer service rep was rude and didn´t help. She kept telling me to talk to the airport as if I hadn´t done that already. Long story short, I got stranded in Boston at 2am where I have no family or friends I could stay with so no sleeping tonight. They didn´t even try accomodating me anywhere and the worst part is the next flight they assigned to me was until the 4th. Again, they are not paying or even bothering to help me find accomodation for 2 nights they´re delaying the flight home.",-1

JetBlue should be deeply ashamed,  they held my flight hostage through the night. 3 hours on the runway from midnight to 2am and then another 3 hours waiting at the gate until 5am before they acknowledged the flight was “delayed” until the following afternoon, and that we should seek hotels. Though the promised vouchers none of their local staff at 5am were trained in these systems and so they encouraged the whole line of 100+ folks to go to hotels on their own, and promised that JetBlue would provide the necessary reimbursements. The delayed flight isn’t leaving till 7:45pm, just 4 hours shy of a full 24-hour delay, and this airline is refusing to book us on another airline that would get us in earlier than 2am in the morning. JetBlue is offering no compensation for this hassle at this time. They are threatening us that if we book with another airline on our own that they won’t reimburse us for the hotel or the flight. What’s most awful about this situation is that I am traveling with my frail and unwell mother-in-law, who needs wheelchair assistance, and this situation is incredibly taxing on her physical and mental health. Beware of this terrible treatment before booking with JetBlue!",-1

I had a 7am flight and missed it because I reached the airport at 6am. I understand the policy that they have in place, it’s no issue but anyway I was sent to customer service. The lady who helped me was so rude I honestly never experienced anything like that before with JetBlue. Seems like she was upset she had to rebook my ticket asking me why did I get the basic premium and she’s not sure that she can rebook me. I was standing rite there when she ask her supervisor if she can rebook me because it looked like she had given up and he ask her if I was there within the hour, she said yes, so he said to her it’s policy to rebook a passenger if they reached within the hour. I smiled feeling happy so she then look and me angry talking behind her voice saying your lucky and next time wouldn’t be so lucky and I must try do better like she’s talking to children. I understand people have bad days but she should stay home if she doesn’t feel the customer service. I came back on that flight so upset.",1

It’s been a week and I am still so beyond disappointed in Jetblue. When my first flight was unexplainably delayed 2 hours, I asked the man at the desk what my options were if I miss my second flight and he dismissively told me I’d be fine. Shocker, my flight arrived after the door to my second flight closed. My plane was still at the gate and the gate had not detached yet, but they would not let myself and 3 other women in my situation on the plane. I missed the 6 hour ride with my boyfriend for our anniversary trip. I asked the Jetblue desk what my options were and they had some of the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced, not sympathetic at all. They could not get me on a flight until the next day, which would have cost me a night at a hotel and one day less of vacation, so I bought a flight on another airline. I payed twice as much for flights as I intended to for this trip and I am in disbelief at JetBlue’s inconsideration.",-1

Let me tell you about today’s check-in experience 11/15/2019 flight number 1460 at Ft Lauderdale airport that almost made me change my mind - but two wonderful staff managed an outstanding recovery to get us on our flight unlike their colleague who was asked for help and he said you are too late despite 2 of us getting bags checked and boarding passes. Attention JetBlue the kiosk will not bring up reservations by name - and it should - first staff blew me off instead of coming over to help when I first asked. When he finally did it was too late for my bag. What are we suppose to do we ask - two on one not checked in. Do you have a car - no we rented and going back home. Oh. Go info desk - he was not helpful - hospitality he is not. In fact, we feel he was mean and didn’t care. Kudos to the woman I mentioned “outstanding service recovery”.",1

2019-11-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Charleston,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,want nothing more to do with them,True,"  Ft Lauderdale to Charleston. JetBlue doesn’t care if you’ve had a family emergency (even when you’re able to provide proof). I should have just stayed with Delta and American. In terms of customer service, you’re dealing with a bunch of robots, you’re not an individual and your circumstances mean nothing to them and the woman on the phone made that very clear. Will not be flying this airline again. For a ticket paid in full, a $100 cancellation fee was applied which means they will fill my seat at no cost to them. And the remainder of my ticket refundable only as useless Jetblue credit which I will never use because they have bitterly disappointed me and I want nothing more to do with them.",-1

Santo Domingo to New York. I was not allowed on my flight because I was crying. I was supposed to leave an early morning flight and decided to change my flight because I did not feel safe in the Dominican republic I paid the fee and I change my flight when I got to the airport they expected me to pay money to move things along and supposedly had to get a special stamp. I was only in the country for one week I do not have to pay taxes. They did not allow me to board my flight.",-1
2019-10-29,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Antigua to New York JFK,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5,rudest service desk people,False,"  We returned from Antigua October 27th via JetBlue. In Antigua we had the rudest service desk people. We were told to be at the airport 3 hours prior to departure. We arrived to be rudely told they will not check check bags until 3 hours prior to plane’s departure. Meaning ours left at 4:20 so they wouldn’t start checking bags until 1:20. Period ! Then we board our flight. The flight attendant as you board was being rude to people boarding. We were in A 1-2. I had to use the rest room so I stand and she snaps at me to not enter the gallery area until after the other person exits the rest room. I knew that but wasn’t given the chance to stop before getting told so. Yet after I returned to my seat three people gathered in the galley and the flight attendant was chatting and having a great time with them as they all stood there fir more then 15 minutes. As she was passing drinks out I just asked for a cup of ice and she rudely hands it to me as if it was going to put her out. 4 hour flight , one dink , 1 snack or buy a sandwich. I realize they just flew into Antigua to drop and pick others up but this girl needs to know how to work with the public or find another job. She was very unprofessional. Second time this has happened. May look for another airline to travel with.",-1
2019-10-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to LaGuardia,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,disgusted with what happened,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to LaGuardia. My husband and I were about to board the plane. My husband boarded but I was requested to either pack my garment bag in my trolley or check it in. I moved to the side and packed it into my trolley. As I was entering the plane the main steward in charge was yelling at me to check in my trolley as there was no room. I was trying to explain to him what I was requested to do, and that my husband saved me a spot for the trolley. He absolutely did not want to hear anything I was saying. I was talking over him as he did not want to hear anything I had to say. I asked him to please call a manager and call my husband already sitting at our seats. He told me ok, but also requested for me to wait outside of the plane. So I did. He never called my husband which upset me very much as I wanted him to de escalate the situation that the steward was escalating. He did not call my husband or a manager. He told me he is not allowing me on this flight. I was shocked. I asked the people walking outside of the plane to call a manager. That took an additional 15 min. I became very upset and told the steward that he is playing a control game and that is disgusting. I pleaded with him to call my husband to come, but he refused. When my husband saw I was not coming, he came looking for me. My husband was trying to reason with the steward with no success. He said that I “disrespected him”. I was clearly upset, but certainly did not act like a lunatic. I never once used any profanity or threats. He stuck his hand into my face and I told Him not to stick his hand in my face. I was upset but did not act in any way shape or form as a lunatic. I am 60 yrs old and traveled all over the world. Never, ever did I experience such an incompetent, unprofessional person in all my travels. Instead of de escalating the issue he escalated it with his power play. There were plenty of passenger witnesses that the airline can question as to what happened. I am totally disgusted with what happened. We will never travel jet blue again.",-1
2019-10-29,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Puerto Plata,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,I had to provide receipts,False,"  New York to Puerto Plata. I used to think Jet blue was a great airline until I used them to fly to the Dominican Republic for a much needed vacation. I always feared having my luggage not make it on the plane or being late as it happened once to me years ago but I received my luggage later that day on a later flight. So this time on Oct 9th because I was flying international I got to the airport early and checked my baggage about 2 hours before my flight. Packed all my nicest summer cloths, along with some jewelry and electronics but I made sure to have a combination lock on my bag. Now when I get to Dominican Republic my luggage never came off the conveyor belt, when I talked to a rep at POP airport they assured me that my luggage will be on the next flight which happened to be the next morning as there was only one morning flight a day out of JFK to POP, all I can think is thank God I packed my underwear in my carry on bag. So the next day comes no luggage and the next and again the next. I came to grips that something had happened and I would have to spend my vacation with the two pairs of basketball shorts i packed all my clean underwear, socks and just 2 shirts so I made work. It didn't totally ruin my trip but it also wasn't very enjoyable. I was worried about my valuables as well as some very sensitive items in my luggage like my blackberry with 15 years of passwords, I had my old blackberry and had purchased a new one as my plan was to manually transfer all the data from the old one to the new one and keep the old one as a backup. I called the airline everyday for an update and they did not want to talk about their claim process if the bag was never found and the reps were callous to say the least and acted as they had no compassion about a man being on vacation with barely any clothes, they said that I would have to wait 5 days before they can discuss the claim process which was a slap in the face as I only wanted to put my mind at ease. So when I flew back into JFK I went straight to the baggage office and they couldn't find my luggage, it was either lost or stolen. I gather it was stolen because. So now over 2 weeks later I have not even received my $30 refund which I paid to check the bag that's now lost, the refund was initiated on the 15th of October and today is the 28th, they said it takes 7 to 10 days and we are on day 13 since it was initiated. Now to the claim process which is the very worst of it all as if it can get worst. The claim process takes them a full 30 days to confirm the bag is lost and on average about 45 days before a reimbursement payment is paid, I submitted a list of items that was in my luggage with pictures of me wearing items from the past that was valuable as proof of ownership. Not only does their claim policy of a cap of $1,500 but the lady handling my claim said my pictures were not acceptable as proof of purchase and I had to provide receipts for everything in the bag.",-1
2019-10-26,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Santiago de los Caballeros,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3,airline does not care,True,"  New York to Santiago de los Caballeros. At the JFK terminal passengers have to check their own bags and bring it to the weight area: self-service at a premium price. A couple of employees for the airlines are there most of them with rude and unpolite attitude. Staff was completely unenthused about providing a good customer service. It seems that these individuals either lost the love for their jobs or were simply on auto-pilot. The aircraft look dirty and stingy with parts falling apart and dirty. The lavatory was a complete mess. I asked the staff for a bottle of water after using the lavatory and was told to return to my seat where later they gave me half a glass of water with little ice. My guess is that JetBlue cannot afford to provide drinks for their customers since this constitutes a premium service. A service of cranberry juice is a tiny 7 oz can. Simply put, pathetic! This airline does not care about providing a decent service to the Dominican Republic because they are the only choice basically. I truly wish for another way to travel to my homeland.",-1
2019-10-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have experienced,True,"  Boston to Detroit. JetBlue is the worst airline I have experienced. I had the flight with JetBlue on 16 August. When I reached Detroit, I didn't receive of one of my Suitcases (it had 23.5 kg weights). At the airport, I filled the form to track the status of my bag. From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. After long time, they paid me only 650$ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay 250$ as compensation.",-1
2019-10-18,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Buffalo,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4,Sat 9 hours in JFK!,False,"  Our flight was delayed before we boarded, after we board and pushed off from the gate we sat on tarmac for a couple hours and pilot timed out and returned us to the gate, then the manager said they were looking for another pilot.  couple of hours passed, no news about the pilot and the whole crew left. We waited until 4.30am until we had to ask what was going on and they told us they were trying to get everyone on the next flight. Unprofessional how there was no news for hours when stranded. Then we got automatically put on the 8.30 flight when there were seats available on 5.45 flight, and we had to fight to get on the 5.45 flight once we where confirmed to be on that flight, it was taken away because they said they were reworking everything and we got put on stand-by. We were promised vouchers/points and didn’t receive a thing when we landed. First time flyers, vacation/reservations ruined, first time JetBlue customers make this right! Sat 9 hours in JFK!",1
2019-10-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Boston,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1,I would not recommend,False,"  Philadelphia to Boston. I would not recommend scheduling a flight with Jetblue. In short, their policies allow them to cancel flights and provide no alternative without any financial responsibility if you need to book with a different airline. My wife was scheduled to fly to Boston for a wedding and her flight was cancelled with no given reason. She was automatically rescheduled for the day of the wedding, which was not useful. So she had to book a flight with a different airline, which cost an additional $200. Jetblue refused to refund us for the additional cost of the replacement flight. They later cited storms as the cause of cancellation, despite the fact that there were no storms and the alternative flight my wife took departed and landed at the same times as the flight she was supposed to take with Jetblue. They did at least refund the cost of their own flight so I'll give them a couple stars for that.",-1
2019-10-11,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,last time I buy JetBlue tickets,True,"  This is the first time I fly with JetBlue in many years, unfortunately it is a total disappointment, I will keep flying with Delta I guess. Their scheduling, communication, and the attitude of the agents working on Gate D3 Atlanta airport (October 10 2019, flight 696) all are unacceptable. They changed our flight departure time twice in one hour, absolutely no communication to the travelers, the gate area is packed with travelers, they told us the flight will be delayed 2 hours, we find seats few gates away, I kept checking the screen in terminal D for updates, only Delta flights are showing, JetBlue flights displayed only on the screen next to the gate, I walked to the gate one hour before the new departure time, they told me the flight is closed, I asked for the supervisor, they replied with a nasty attitude, you have to go to the baggage claim area to speak with the supervisor (no supervisor available at the gate), they say the delay was estimate, they say all times are estimate, although the screen at the showed 2 hours delay. The only time that is not estimated is the flight close time, they failed to provide their customers with the courtesy of communication. It will be the last time I buy JetBlue tickets.",-1
2019-10-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Washington DC,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,does not take responsibility for their actions,True," We were delayed 5 hours and 7 minutes flying from Orlando to DC. It was not related to weather, as very few other flights surrounding us were delayed. We were told that the plane we were supposed to be on was coming from Nassau and was delayed, so we were then put on a different plane coming from San Juan which was arriving at a later time. Scheduled departure was 12.59pm, and was changed to 6.07pm. The flight attendant announced to all of us on the plane prior to departure that we would all be entitled to and would be receiving a $150 credit. I even confirmed with her during the flight just to make sure I heard correctly. 7 days had passed and I still hadn’t received the email with instructions on where to find my credit (they told us we would be receiving one within 7 days). After being on hold multiple times, I reached out to customer service on their website and received some answers (photos attached). I was told that we would only be receiving $100 because it was weather related and that’s what the airport told them. I received many emails notifying me of the delayed (it delayed 4 times), and never was it stated that it was due to weather. Weather was not a factor that day for flying. Either in DC or Orlando, or anywhere in between. It also doesn’t state anywhere in their terms that you will not receive compensation if your delay is weather related, however this is what customer service told me. When I told her that the flight attendant told us all it would be $150, she said “I don’t know why they would say that”. JetBlue does not take responsibility for their actions, they do not stick to their terms that are clearly stated on their website. And quite frankly they aren’t helpful and are rude.",-1
2019-10-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Phoenix to Cancun via Fort Lauderdale,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,really terrible service,True," We took the red eye from PHX - FLL on our way to Cancun for our honeymoon. We had paid to upgrade our seats to the first row. When we boarded we stowed our single backpack about 24”x12” in the overhead. We slept most of the flight. I woke up to the flight attendant stirring through the overhead. She took down our single carryon and attempted to move it to the overhead in row 6! I stood up and told her that was my bag. She said it couldn’t be up there. I said why? She said because she needed to put her bag up there. I said why don’t you put your bag back there in row 6? She said that overhead space isn’t guaranteed. I told her I know but my bag has been up there the entire flight. She told me it hadn’t. I told it had, she told me to get back in my seat. Then came up and glared over the bulkhead at me and spoke to me with a very rude and condescending tone telling me that I was lying about where my luggage had been stowed and I should be quite and let her move it. Finally the other flight attendant got up and moved his luggage then put my luggage back where it had been the entire flight. The staff member sat in her jump seat and glared at me the rest of the flight. I contacted Jetblue and their response was overhead bin space is not guaranteed. I will never fly Jetblue again. All of our other 3 Jetblue flights also had really terrible service. One piece of our checked luggage had the front pocket torn off and contents lost. The other check bag was handled roughly enough to break plastic hangers inside it.",-1

I had to ask twice and a second flight attendant retrieved me some ear buds. On the way back to Palm Beach I had the same experience where I asked for tissues and was completely ignored after being acknowledged again. I’m not sure if they were so busy they both forgot. I am not difficult. I did not ask for food or drinks. Palm Beach airport was pleasant and quick. New York was slow and painful witnessing a very rude pre security ID check person. Tv shorted out as well. Very unpleasant. Before this trip I always recommended Jet Blue.,-1
2019-09-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,customer service not helpful,False," Orlando to Newark. Unfortunately, Jetblue customer service is not very helpful or flexible. Their website does not provide clear disclosure. We have been in communication for weeks and the best they could do is say that if we are not traveling in the next year feel free to give our travel bank credits to a friend or family member. Terrible!! We were in Florida returning home on 9/2. We were watching the weather and the website for weather alerts due to hurricane Dorian. We are not frequent flyers and have never been in this type of situation before. On Friday 8/31 the news said that Orlando airport was closing for the storm at 2am on Monday. We saw the hurricane Dorian alert with the travel waivers on your website. At that point, we expected the flight would be cancelled and we would have to find another way home. We thought we would have to cancel the flight for a refund and then we would use the refund to rent a car to get home. We would have called into customer service however the alert said you could just go online to My trips. It looked clear and simple so we went online and the screen came up to cancel. The screen had our credit card number on the screen (partially blocked out) with the amount. This made it look like the funds would be refunded to the card. There was no clear disclosure saying the refund would go to the travel bank. We received an email stating the funds went to the travel bank. We then went online and chatted with a representative. We explained the situation and they said that only flights cancelled by Jetblue are refunded to your card. We did not realize that was part of the waiver when cancelling. We then asked to cancel the cancellation and we would stay on the flight. They said the flight was now booked and they could not do that.",-1
2019-09-28,0.2,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Los Angeles,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,have zero interest in helping customers,True," I will never fly JetBlue again. Two major issues: 1) Customer Service, especially the ""Help Needs"" service desk at the airport in JFK are rude, unprofessional and have zero interest in ""helping customers"". After arriving in a wheelchair - post surgery, I was informed by Check-In that I was too late for the flight, the plane doors were closed. They sent me to the Help Needs counter to schedule me for a later flight. While going to the ""Help"" desk the PA announcement was made for the boarding of ""my"" flight. The Check-In rep had lied to me. They intentionally made me miss my flight to LAX. 2) My family was in the process of relocating from NYC to elsewhere. My daughter had to re-schedule the flight she and I were due to take together on Sept. 17 because of a related moving problem. We re-booked her. It was a day of horror at the airport for her yesterday. JetBlue employees did everything they could to delay and harass my daughter because I called the 800 number and tried to get a reduced rate on my daughter's unused plane ticket. After paying for the initial one way ticket-$233.30, which they did at first offer to allow a ""free"" (replacement) plane trip, I wound up paying an additional $255.00 plus $75.00 because because they said she had ""missed"" her flight and was traveling the next day, she was required to pay more money for her ticket. JetBlue ""canceled"" her flight because they said she had intentionally missed her flight while at the airport. This was a lie. She missed her flight while they played games about getting her a refund and getting her on the next flight to LAX. Then when she left the ""Help"" desk my daughter went to the TSA Pre-check entrance where they told her she had too many bags to go through the TSA pre-check. (She then returned to check one of her two bags with JetBlue, against her better judgement ($30.00). The bag went to LAX without my daughter because, then they said my daughter did not have a TSA pre-check number (this was a JetBlue lie to get her to go on the regular line not the pre-check line). She has a TSA pre-check number. As a result of them searching her, they said they were going to call the police-she ""had something under her belt"". My daughter said ""sure, search me"". Of course they found no reason to have delayed her. Result? She missed her second flight to LAX. My daughter is not a terrorist. JetBlue staff at JFK at the ""Help"" desk was most unhelpful, disgustingly rude and offensive. I always traveled JetBlue. The way they treated me and my daughter was worse than contemptible. They do not care about their customers. I do not care to be so poorly treated by employees of JetBlue Airlines. All the good that I ever experienced in previous travel with JetBlue was canceled by these employees this past week. Oh, when we tried to get her bag today that we were previously told yesterday was sent to LAX, the baggage claim person at JFK said she didn't know where my daughter's bag was-could be anywhere.",-1

The cost for my flight was about $300 less than I could find with any competitors, so I was expecting some kind of substandard service. But I have no complaints at all. I'm over 6 feet tall, and my seats had plenty of room. All flights were on time, and I was able to volunteer to have my carry-on handled like luggage without charge. I enjoyed the entertainment system on Jetblue's recently refurbished cabins, and I wish only that connectivity had been available on the international legs of the trip.",1
2019-09-24,0.4,Business,Premium Economy,Boston to Los Angeles,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,I was lied to,True," Recently flew to LAX from Boston on JetBlue, the pilot announced prior to flight at the gate that the TV's were not working and that they would give us JetBlue points for the inconvenience. Later I find out Jetblue does not give out points for issues with travel. So basically I was lied to. On top of that, a year and half ago there was a technical issue on our flight and we had points given before we even landed, a major reason I used to chose JetBlue first, prompt customer service. The other reason being the technology on board which is now dated and failing on a lot of flights. The flight attendants on this particular flight were miserable and had no empathy towards the lack of entertainment nor the fact the power was not working in my seat. Jetblue used to be a great customer first airline, now it falls into the likes of being just another airline with ok service and amenities.",-1

Very dissatisfied with experience and will not recommend using them to save a few bucks. My flight was cancelled 5 minutes past boarding time. We were to leave at 5am and we're at the airport since 345am. The bathrooms, both, on the airplane broke and they could not fix it. We were told on the intercom the flight was cancelled and to come to the counter to get rebooked. The only flight available for me was the next day. I missed work and lost another vacation day after attending a funeral. Their compensation was to credit me $100 and I was told that is it. I paid for a high Monday fair when the Tuesday fair was $ 100 less and the rep. Told me there is nothing she would do for me. Not even credit me the $140 difference in price your own airline and other airlines offered for Tuesday? The rep then told me it wasn't cancelled it was delayed and left at 1039am. She told me over and over it was delayed not cancelled. I told her I was there and it was cancelled that's why 200 other flyers were rebooking flights. Also you should know they do not have any parterships with other airlines so once you pay you stay with JetBlue. I've not been treated by your competition like this and will not fly or recommend anyone to fly on this airline. We're booking a reunion for 45 family members and will choose Southwest to fly. My thoughts are when I pay you to take me somewhere at a specific time you do everything to make that happen or refund your customers. It certainly wouldn't work the other way around if I were to change my mind at the last minute.",-1

Got bumped out of my seat next to my boyfriend and told that I couldn’t do anything about it. They then mandatory checked my bag without my permission.

That was my case: I paid more and I was by the bathroom, with the noise and smell of it. Terrible.",1

We were on tour at USA and Jet Blue staff behavior gave us a strange feeling. Can not imagine that staff of a service provider in United States can act this way. At first on MCO airport while check-in they made two different ways of check-in for two different tickets of my own family. I traveled 3 weeks later then my family from DXB to EWR. So we had two different tickets though while return was together. I think Jet Blue staff while check-in make their own rules that suits their convenience and not the convenience of pax. Later at EWR the lady staff who was to take care of our bags was acting as if we are asking a free favor from JetBlue or their staff. We were already tired of night journey and on top of that such behavior made me decided that hence forth unless some strong reason in my life, I will never ever travel by Jet Blue even I get a free ticket. Such a poor service and such a difficult behavior of Jet Blue Staff!  Jet Blue shall inform their staff that passengers buy ticket and travel using their flights. We were polite at all the times then why act this way? Jet Blue Staff behaved like obliging us. It was beyond our expectation even from humanity point of view. No where in USA during our 7 weeks/4 weeks tour any one behaved so bad with us.",-1

I printed the confirmation page including ""Itinerary confirmation Your all set to Jet!"" and a confirmation code. In September, I noticed I did not receive an email confirmation. I called customer service and after a 30 minute wait, I was told that my reservation did not go through. When I pressed for a reason, the customer service agent hung up. I then tried to rebook the same reservation 3 more times (using 2 different devices). After getting to the end for all 3 times, the system timed out and told me to call customer service. My previous experience with JetBlue was a round trip to NYC (perfect) and a round trip to Boston (flight cancelled the way out and had to book on another airline) the flight back was delayed 18 hours - first for weather and then because they could not locate a crew. We fly 12 times plus a year. Avoid Jet Blue. Their technology is a mess and they are short staffed.",-1

I hadn't eaten all day and forgot my snacks at home, and the flight attendants told me I could have as many snacks as i wanted and could grab more anytime i wanted. The tickets were inexpensive, the attendants were extremely friendly, and my bags were already waiting for me at the claim. I dont think i could have had a better experience anywhere else.

When we approached the desk to ask, we were “greeted” with a very unpleasant Jet Blue representative who was unhelpful and threatened to have as removed. Her first comments were “you are late because you went to Starbucks,” except we went to Starbucks over an hour before coming to gate. We had been at the gate at least 30 minutes prior to takeoff. They refused to open the doors, which is understandable, but the way in which we were treated was unacceptable. We were told to see the service desk who also were unhelpful and did not offer anything to remedy the issue. There were no flights offered out that day as well as no information as what else to. Other than “That is your only choice!” (I would put that in all caps but they would not post my review otherwise). We ended up booking another flight out with another airline who were very helpful and apologetic even though they did not cause the issue. We were able to get on a flight out within an hour. Now that’s customer service. Maybe this airline should send employees to get trained by another airline agency. Until then, I refuse to fly this airline again because I feel all should be treated with a little bit of courtesy.",-1

We were in boarding group E since we didn't want to pay more. After watching others load onto the plane with more than 2 carry-on bags and cabin staff luggage on board we were informed that there was no room for our carry on. It would have to be checked at the gate. We were seated in the front part of the aircraft and yet somehow when we were deplaning people who had sat in front of us were either waiting or walking towards our row to retrieve their luggage.,-1

After multiple delays, spanning 11 hours, the flight was canceled due to 'mechanical issues', crew time limits, etc. We were all told that we would each receive $350 in 'travel credits'. Then I got to stand in line for another 30 minutes, at 2 am, to re-book. During my stay in line, I saw that I now had an email from JetBlue, stating that I was scheduled to fly out at 6 am (in a few hours..) on another plane, go thru JFK, and spend 7 hrs there, before flying on to Orlando! Pretty unappealing since I just had my nonstop canceled, and I was exhausted. I ended up getting rescheduled for a flight 2 days later. Of course, I had to call my girlfriend at 3 am to pick me up by now. On 8-28-19, after my stay in Orlando, I tried to check in online, and to print my boarding pass. My confirmation code was 'not found'. I tried the hotel's computers, and the phone app. I was able however, after a 18 minute wait, to reach a real person at JetBlue. They told me I was in the system, but would have to check in at the airport the next day, when I was flying back to Worcester. Awesome. So, on 8-29-19, I checked in at the airport. While there, I asked why I'd received an email from JetBlue Reservations, with my itinerary, and a cost that was double that of my original round-trip ticket. I was told that the cost looked ok in the system, and not to worry, unless I saw a problem with my credit card. My journey with JetBlue wasn't complete until there was a 2.5 hour delay due to yes, another 'mechanical issue'. I made it back to Worcester. Now I get to wade through 3 emails explaining how I get to use the 'travel credits'.",-1

However, on my most recent trip I did not receive the normal Flight attendant service. I am a Mosaic customer and on my most recent flight when I the flight attendant was passing out beverages I asked for a Vodka and cranberry juice. The attendant responded with there is no more Vodka on the plane, which I could understand not having enough inventory if I was in the last few seats to be served, however I was in Row 10. About 10 minutes later I saw a passenger ask for Vodka and he received 2 bottles. When I saw the Flight attendant again I said I thought there was no more Vodka on the plane, his comment was we located some additional Vodka, so I again requested a Vodka and cranberry. After waiting approximately 15 minutes I still had not received my drink, I could see the FA in the front galley just standing around. I had to use the restroom so I went to the front of the plane, after using the restroom, the FA was still in the front galley I asked him where was my Vodka, he reached into a plastic bag and pulled out a bottle of Vodka. I asked him for a glass of Ice and the cranberry juice, he said I would have to go to the back of the plane and asked the Flight attendant back there which I did and she was very helpful.",1

I bought 4 tickets. The flight from SFO to JFK due to weather conditions but that we shouldn't change our itinerary because the connecting flight was delayed as well so we would still make it on time. However our connecting flight landed at JFK on time which doesn't make any sense and then left on time which meant we were stranded at JFK all night since it was the last flight 11:30pm. The next flight was 6am. We went to a kiosk and asked for help, the girl wouldn't even look up from her personal cell phone until I said her name. Keep in mind my children are 11 and 6 year old twins, exhausted hungry and cold. The agent couldn't help us she said because she didn't have a ""radio"" or phone to call anybody to help with water, cots, snacks or food or anything in fact including getting us on the next flight. We walked across the entire terminal and waited 45 minutes to talk to somebody who said they were closing. Mohamed said they had many delays because of construction at the terminal. We along with 40 other people demanded they help us ... they promised cots and water and they never came. After we went back to follow up all employees of Jetblue were gone. I found a maintenance man to help and he brought water. JetBlue didn't care about me and more importantly the safety or conditions for my little kids and their employees were beyond unprofessional lacking empathy or will to do the right thing. Other airlines provide blankets, snacks, water, and assistance. Don't lie and say weather and then not even care for your customers.",-1

On August 19, I had to fly out to Orlando Florida from JFK with Jetblue flight 1183 leaving at 2:5- and arriving in Orlando at 6:09. Grant it I understand issues happen and things delay an aircraft from leaving I get it. However, we boarded the plane 30 minute late. WE got on the runway and they left us there for over 3 hours. To a point my dad needed to get up because he suffers from blood clot. However no one would let him get up. They kept telling him to sit down, which caused him health issues. We originally had to drive down to Florida on Saturday but because of my dad issues we ended up flying. If I drove to Florida I would be in Orlando quicker then what Jetblue did to us. We got to the airport at 12 noon. My dad had nothing to eat which means he couldnt take his medication. After over 3 hours on the plane they finally got us back to the gate. To let some people get off and others stay on the plane. My dad stayed behind because his wheelchair was below the aircraft. About 45 minute later they wanted everyone off the plane. Jetblue refused to give us back my dad wheelchair that they refused to go below the aircraft to get it where I checked it in at the gate. They wouldn't even give him a wheelchair that he had to struggle to get off the plane. The guy was chasing us off the plane, almost causing my father to all most fall because he lost his balance. Then when at the gate, the lady at the desk said her shift was over and she can careless of what happens at this point. Wouldn't even give us any information. A pilot had to come off the plane to find out why we weren't being boarded back on the plane, to realize that no jetblue agent was at the gate to assist us. Even after we landed at 11 something. It took over an hour and a half for them to give us our luggage from the plane. Many people are there complaining, some with small kids. Yet Jetblue was heartless, disrespectful and did have a care in the world about the people waiting. As long as they are making their money Knowing most of the people on that flight didn't have food to eat for over 12 hours. Even the corporate office said they wont help because it not a big issue or the fact it didn't fall into an FA issue.  They even broke my dad wheelchair. I had to rent one while at old key west resort. That i even forward my invoice showing my purchase, yet they still wont replace his damage wheelchair. They cause me so much more money out of pocket - a new wheelchair, had to spend extra on my rental because the one I had reserved was given out because I didnt pick it up by 8 pm. and had to pay to upgrade to another car. Yet Jetblue wouldn't help me or my family. Even passenger on the flight called to complain and no one would help them.  Also keep in mind Jetblue let flight schedule to leave to Orlando after us ended up leaving before us.",-1

In preparation for the departure flight from New York to Orlando, we sat for over 2 hours on the runway! Our flight kept getting delayed without clear communication as to why. On the return trip, to New York, we experienced more of the same! Our flight was delayed by 4 hours! The crew members did not greet everyone or behaved as though they wanted to serve you. I asked for an additional cup of ice water during the flight was responded to with a contemptuous “will that be all?!” As in please do not ask me for anything else.

This was my first international flight with jetBlue and it was a pleasure to fly with them. Check in in Mexico City has to be done at the counter since mobile boarding passes are unavailable for the flight, regardless it was a breeze. I got an older A320 with no power outlets and non-working WiFi but at least the movies were all working and the crew was exceptional, two crew members remembered me from previous flights years ago and were extremely courteous and pleasant.

Who is doing the scheduling a 1st grader? Maintenance delays for lights that are behind panels that are not even on a checklist but someone notices it so we wait hr for maintenance?

I had my and my family's two different bookings of flight by Emirates from MCO to Dubai via Newark as we travelled separately from Dubai to NY. Our flight from MCO to Newark was by JetBlue. I had a confirmation email from Emirates that I can check in from MCO to Newark alone and then recheckin at Newark for Dubai by Emirates to that I can add my bags from Newark. JetBlue check in staff refused me to check in from MCO to Newark alone. He forced us to check in from MCO to Dubai directly. This forced me to make transfer resetting our bags as we already had planned bags to check in at Newark. Later when I checked in my wife and son the other staff allowed us to check in from. MCO to Newark without any trouble. Now this made is so many troubles as we had no plan of reschedule our check in bags. JetBlue staff had no regrets for their such inconsistent policies even though we were facing troubles.  As a matter of service Jetblue staff at check-in could have read the email from Emirates, but he refused to care about it. In future I will certainly think before I book a flight and avoid with JetBlue.",-1

I have always loved JetBlue and I tell my family to fly with them but my opinion has now changed and I am unsure I will ever fly with them again. The flight I took today was terrible. I boarded the plane and no one in the crew seemed happy. I said hello and smiled as I do to everyone I meet and I didn’t get a smile or even a word back, and they were looking right at me! One of the crew in particular was very rude and unhappy. He pushed the cart around to sell stuff, I bought a cracker snack box and he never said a word or smiled even with me thanking him and wishing him a good day, the same guy brings the drinks and same thing! The pilot never turned off the seatbelt sign (there was no inclement weather or jolts) and toward the end of the flight I hit the assistance button because my son had to use the restroom really bad and felt like he wasn’t allowed to get up. The same crew member comes and I asked him if my son could go to the restroom because he had been holding it all flight, his response was “no, I can’t let him go because the seatbelt sign is on and it would fall on him if my son got hurt” - so I responded “um, so my son can’t use the restroom?”, his response “no” (at this point my 12 year old is in tears because he felt like he was going to go in his seat). I asked “well what happens if he goes anyway?”, which then received an eye roll and him walking away from us. I told my son to go to the bathroom but to the way the guy spoke to us my son was diving and saying he can’t because he didn’t want to get in trouble. I finally convinced him and he went, though as soon as he got out of the bathroom, the same crew member felt it necessary to come over the speaker with an annoyed voice saying, everyone needs to obey the rules and stay seated when the seatbelt sign is on, just to make my son feel worse...I was livid at this point and couldn’t wait to get off the flight! When leaving the flight none of the crew said goodbye or smiled (which was ridiculous). I have worked in customer service my entire life and no matter what is going on, this is not acceptable!",-1

Thankfully they gave me a ticket for the next day and a place to stay, but the next day the flight was also delayed.

The flight was scheduled to depart FLL at 8;32 PM EST and arrive at JFK at roughly 11:36 PM. During the morning on that day, I went online to check the status of the flight. To my surprise, I found out the flight was delayed for nearly three hours! It now read that the flight was scheduled to depart at 11:10 PM and arrive at 2:07 AM. I was shocked at how long this delay and attempted to find out the reason why. However, the Jetblue website was unclear in explaining why. This was urgent because I had a connecting international flight out of JFK from a different airline that was scheduled to depart on-time at 2:30 AM. Because of this situation, I figured I would get to the airport early so I could maybe get on an earlier flight to New York. When I arrived at FLL, I went towards the Jetblue customer service desk. After over 40 minutes of standing in line, I was finally able to talk to a customer service representative. I explained to the representative my entire situation and he said he would try to see what he can do. After 20 minutes of searching on his computer, he said that he could get me on an 8:30 PM Jetblue flight to New York was also delayed and originally scheduled to leave at 2:00 PM. I asked if there were seat available and he said there were. I was hopeful for a few moments but that ended when he stopped talking and went on his phone. After some time, he seemed to make a call but never actually said anything on the phone. After over an hour, he finally told us that this flight that would have saved my entire situation was completely sold out. I had no idea when it was sold out or why it wasn't sold out when the representative told me he could get me seats on it. I asked him if there was anything else that was available and he just said no. I asked him what the reason was for the delay and he said there were thunderstorms in NY causing all flights to NY to get held back. At this point, I was frustrated as I could have used another airline to buy a ticket to NYC instead of wasting my time with Jetblue customer service. However, it was too late and it appeared that all other flights to NYC and Newark that would have fit my time frame were unavailable. I looked at the departure screen and noticed only Jetblue flights to every destination were delayed. No other airline had delayed flights. I also called my family in NYC and they said there were no thunder or rain there.  I decided to just wait for my original flight. At around 11 PM, it was announced that the flight was delayed to 11:30 because there was no pilot for the plane. After 40 minutes, we were finally able to board the plane. After arriving in JFK, I had to reschedule my connecting flight as it already left. They explained I must get a confirmation from Jetblue that my flight was indeed delayed. However, the JFK Jetblue customer service refused information for anything delayed. One of the staff outright said ""We can't give any information about delayed flights!"" and claimed I was ""threatening him"" when I argued it was the other airline that requested the delay confirmation. He began walking towards me closely in an attempt to push me away form the help desk. Worst customer service ever, no transparency or honesty, rude and confrontational employees, I will never fly jetblue again!",-1

This was my first time flying JetBlue and although the plane had some serious signs of wear and tear the flight experience was pleasant. The front seat reclined, the free snacks, entertainment, drinks, and Wi-Fi were a plus. I wish JetBlue would consider doing rows of two seats and charging more for a bigger seat Like Spirit does with the Big Front Seat. JetBlue is the only four-star airline we have in the USA and it shows. You get a lot for what you pay and the experience on the ground and in the air is very pleasant. Good job JetBlue!

After boarding the flight and having us sit around for an hour so they disembarked us and said there was a simple sensor that needed to be fixed. On an hourly basis they said the problem was going to be resolved. The 10:58 am flight finally took off at 8:30 pm. The level of either incompetence or of deception was extraordinary even in these days where poor performance is expected. It was as if the airline did not want us to cancel and switch to another airline irrespective of the inconvenience to the passenger. Everyone involved in this clear deception did so with a pleasant smile on their face which leads me to conclude the reason for the delay was incompetence rather than deception. We finally decide to pay for a very expensive last minute ticket to an alternate airport that was closer to our destination. Now catch this. Even though a $250 payment was promised per the passenger bill of rights, since we were delayed over 8 hours, if you cancelled your reservation even at the last minute to get on an alternate flight you would lose the payment. So we got a new ticket but did not cancel the old ticket since the payment would exceed the ticket cost. We have had several severe delays on JetBlue recently. The latest 8 hours to fix a sensor was the last straw. Clearly this is a severe management problem. Maintenance is not up to the challenge of flying the heck out of these planes and clearly the airport staff has not been taught how to value customers and treat them honestly. Goodbye JetBlue you were a good friend but have lost your way.",-1

We boarded and deplaned my flight, 224, out of LAX to JFK twice! The cancellation was not made official so I could not change my flight online. The line to service help was extremely long and I could not get through to anyone on the phone for over an hour. I risked getting offline to go to a gate in order to get out on standby for a flight leaving the same night. I could not leave the airport so I have to get my checked bag mailed to me, whenever/if ever they find it. I understand delays happen all of the time, however, this situation was very poorly managed by the instructed means from the staff. Once I reached JFK, I received and email notifying me of my flight change from Burbank, a completely different airport in LA which would leave the next night and get me back to JFK two days later! I was in LAX from 6 am through 6pm due to delays and did not reach JFK until 2am the next morning, up almost 24 hours at that point. To make matters worse, flights that took off after my flight flew to JFK just fine. Even other delayed flights left before my flight was even *unofficially* canceled. I don’t know why my flight was so disastrous, but not officially canceling my flight at all really screwed me over. Please do better!",-1

He (Tom) didn't just help us get our way through the airport and get us where we needed to be, he gave us first-class tickets, a comfortable flight with a new aircraft, he gave us flight credit and free luggage.

They refused to change it. When we got on the plane the dad went to sit with the toddler. Flight attendant came and told him to move and he said no my toddler will not sit alone.

We were all sitting next to one another. As I was standing in line to board, they called me up to the front desk. Once there, a man handed me a new boarding pass with a new seat assignment in the very back of the plane(second to last row). He told me the reasoning was because two people wanted to sit next to each other. Why those two people matter more than my friend and I, I do not know. Very frustrating as most people were already on the plane and thus I didn’t feel like I had time to try and possibly get a new seat near my friends. Since I have already gone through the process of writing the review, I figured I’d add my flight down as well. Everything on the way down was great except for the flight attendants. They were among the worst I’ve encountered while flying. They were rude to me as well as other passengers. I’ve always flown Alaska Airlines but my friends and I decided to fly Jet Blue this time because the tickets were cheaper. Now I recognize Alaska Airlines is worth the extra money.",-1
2019-07-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Philadelphia,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,I will never use them again,False,  Boston to Philadelphia. First and last time flying jet blue. I volunteered to check my carry on in Aruba since there was no storage space. I was to connect with a flight in Boston at 9:25 to take me to Philadelphia at 10:55. I was told there were mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane from Raleigh landing about 11. At this point my parking pass expires and my car was at risk of being towed. I begged the parking for an extension until 1 am so I was anxious about that. We boarded and proceeded to sit for another 30 min for a computer issue. We finally took off and landed around 12:30 and my luggage went missing. I had to get to my car and drive 90 min to home so jet blue said they will deliver my bag. I returned home at 3 am and my bag 11:00 pm the next day. JetBlue offered me a useless $50 credit to be used within a year. I will never use them again so what would I do with a credit? Never again!,-1

2019-07-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Dallas,,,,,,1.0,1,terrible experience today,False,"  Boston to Dallas. After the terrible experience with JetBlue today I will never fly jet blue again and I fly most weeks, and this is the first time I've ever been unable to simply print a boarding pass because I was not a full hour early. Since I was carry on, TSA pre check and saw it would only take a couple of minutes I get the attention of one of the workers to tell them I still have plenty of time, just need a pass, but instead he tells me to get in the line of people checking bags etc and ""they will just need to rebook you."" I then get in line, still think there is a chance as I am about the 7th person, and watch the workers spend as much time talking to each other as calling the next customer. When I finally get up I get the lecture on being an hour early and am told they will replace my 6.49 am flight with a 2:15 pm flight - causing me to miss an important lunch meeting. As she is finishing, I overhear the worker at the next station giving the same 1 hour lecture to the next customer over. Anyone on in the us who flies any other airline with tsa pre clear and no bags to check is used to having no issue 45 or 55 minutes out unless TSA preclear has a backlog. After all that I breeze through TSA in about 2 minutes go to the flight for my 2:15 pm flight and notice I'm still there almost 15 minutes before my original flight was scheduled - so having more than 7 hours to kill because of jetblues awful process, I walk across the terminal to find the flight is closed though no it yet taking off, and that they did actually call my name at the gate and held in case I showed up. The lady at that gate was very nice and apologetic. It appears Delta can book me last minute on another flight for points, and get me in 5 hours earlier, so I will certainly advise everyone to book with anyone but JetBlue.",-1

Having to get to Orlando FL today, I contacted customer service and changed departing airport. I drove from SWF, Newburgh, NY To Queens NY, 2hrs. As they had a flight leaving around 9pm on time. In route we started getting texts as well. Flight delayed. Drove 2hrs away, parked my car in the Bronx and took a taxi to airport cause it’s cheaper. Now sitting in LGA flight now scheduled to depart at 12:26am From 2pm I’ve been traveling. This is it! I'm done with Jetblue. They have turned from one of the best to the worst. I would recommend to anyone, you get what you pay for. Then I’m told because I have a JetBlue Credit Card, I wouldn’t have to pay for my first checked bag - but it has to be a certain Jetblue card not mine. Paid extra for “LegRoom” plus the cost of the air fare. Being told delay was due to weather, thunderstorm in the area. Yet, we didn’t see a cloud in the sky.  If I could give a rating less then zero I would. And just in case, this ain’t the first time. So my frustration has been building",-1

Traveling with my family to Mexico, JetBlue initially did not allow us to select seats due to over boarding. In order to sit with my family, we purchased upgraded extra room seats at $60 a seat. When we arrived at the gate to board with my son traveling with disabilities including major anxiety. The gate agents then proceeded to refuse us early boarding despite all three members in the emergency row, which we paid $180 to be sitting in being over 18 (legally they have to be over 15) because we had a minor in a different row. We were then left on the side while they boarded the plane and began to cause my son massive anxiety and he broke down in tears at the gate. They jet blue agents sold us seats at outages mark ups to avoid a situation like this only to cause an even worse fiasco. Absolutely unacceptable and a terrible way to begin our vacation.",-1

This is literally the second time JetBlue has saved my trip. Both times I’ve had cancelled flights and the other airlines refused to help me find a quick and easy way home. I’m pregnant so staying at an airport or hotel isn’t great, so the less time spent the better.

2019-07-18,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to New York,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,3,real kudos to the staff,True," Boston to New York (JFK). For this flight, I was traveling solo and had a connecting flight at JFK to an international destination. Unfortunately, yet again, my Jetblue flight was delayed, and this time, we left about 2 hours and 30 minutes behind schedule. It seems that while our plane was already at the gate, we needed a particular pair of pilots to be present, and they were still stuck flying another plane into Boston before flying ours onward to New York. After flying several times with Jetblue over the course of a month, I think I can safely say this airline has some pretty serious aircraft operational issues which need to be worked out. Once again, everyone I interacted with both on the ground and in the air was wonderful. I must give real kudos to the gate staff who managed to get everyone onto the airplane in a matter of a few minutes once the pilots had arrived for our flight. In addition to this, the flight attendants ensured that all beverages and all snacks were available during this flight. This would already be an achievement for a flight of this short duration, but it was even more impressive considering that the pilots managed to fly us to New York about 15 minutes faster than usual! Kudos to them as well! So while our flight did arrive 2 hours late into JFK and would have meant my missing my connecting flight if it had not been for my connecting flight's mysteriously being rescheduled to 2 hours later as of a week in advance, I cannot in good conscience give the people involved in this flight a bad rating. They truly did everything humanly possible to rectify a terrible situation, and I am grateful to them (as I hope other passengers were, too). But that said, on the operations side, Jetblue really needs to get their act together. I've seen too many delays for their flights by this point to think it's a rarity, and people really do have places they need to get to on time!",1

Our flight ended up leaving JFK about 35 minutes late. It appeared to have something to do with aircraft operational issues. The good news is, we did seem to make up for some of the lost time on the tarmacs in New York and Boston, and we ended up arriving at the gate in Boston only about 20 minutes late. This wasn't a big deal for my family in particular, but I could tell that this was a big deal for some other passengers who had connecting flights and who bolted off of the plane as soon as we had arrived at the gate in Boston. During the flight, once again, all beverages were available, but only cookies and Cheez-Its were available as snacks. I have noticed that, while in the past, they offered only either water or Coke as beverages during this flight, they have expanded the beverage options. While I do appreciate this, I think I would have more greatly appreciated their offering all of the snacks instead of all of the beverages, as I always get excited for the blue potato chips on Jetblue flights. I think offering more snack options instead of more beverage options would probably also be easier for the flight attendants to manage than the current situation, where it seems they are really pressed for time given the short duration of this flight. The flight attendants work very hard! They are also always pleasant. Also, the individual TV screens worked during this flight, which was nice. A very good experience overall.",1

Unfortunately, my family's experience for this flight was not nearly as good as for the flight I previously reviewed from Boston to Rochester. Our flight ultimately left Rochester about two hours late, seemingly due to weather-related issues. The TV screens on our plane were not functional during this flight. While all beverages were available, snacks available were limited to either cookies or Cheez-Its. I'd like to give a shout out, however, to the flight attendants during this flight, as they managed the service well and were accommodating with beverages despite some pockets of turbulence along the way. The flight took the expected time, and we arrived at JFK about two hours late.",1

2019-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to San Jose via Fort Lauderdale,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,miss our connecting flight,False,"  
We were supposed to fly from Hartford, CT to San Jose, Costa Rica through Fort Lauderdale (FLL). Our flight from Hartford to FLL was delayed due to both mechanical and weather issues by over three hours which as a result would make us miss our connecting flight from FLL to Costa Rica. JetBlue had to move us to a flight to the following day making us miss a whole day of our vacation. Apparently JetBlue has no agreements with any other airlines when it comes to accommodating their customers to try to find other available flight options. According to JetBlue rules, passengers are entitled to $250 credit when their flights are delayed for more than 6 hours when unrelated to weather. Our flight was delayed by 24 hours due to both mechanical and weather conditions, however, JetBlue refused to compensate because they are blaming the weather only, even though I have an official JetBlue email stating both mechanical and weather being the cause of the delay. After a big fight on the phone (without any apology but rather being told that we were not even charged extra!), finally got $75 per person credit to be used within a year. JetBlue also does not reimburse its customers for hotel stays due to delayed flights.",-1

We had a short connection in JFK with a different airline, so we were concerned that we would not make our connection. We talked to the staff on the flight about our situation and they made a special announcement as we were landing, asking everyone that if they did not have to rush to make a connecting flight to please remain seated until those who did (our family) exited the plane.

In the past, my parents and I have tried traveling from Boston to Rochester on American Airlines, and in most cases, American Airlines failed actually to get us to Rochester. This time, I encouraged my parents to book us tickets on JetBlue instead now that they are offering this route. What a difference! Our experience for this route on JetBlue was so much better than American. Our plane departed Boston and arrived in Rochester on time. We were offered the full spectrum of available snacks and drinks. The personal IFE monitors were functional. The flight attendants were great, too. All around, it was an excellent experience!",1
2019-07-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Ft Lauderdale to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Awfully bad experience,False," Ft Lauderdale to San Francisco. Awfully bad experience. I travelled from FLL to SFO with my family. 1. Jet Blue prices grow much faster than other companies when you add just the basic option, in my case, it was +50%, that puts this company to the same category with American Airlines, United, etc. 2. For this price you have service, that is worse than the appropriate low-cost one. In FLL the terminal where Jet Blue operates is far away from the rental cars parking, comparing to United, that operates in the same terminal. And even if Jet Blue tails and admits it, you can't get anything - no business lounge, no paid hotels, absolutely nothing. 3. I came to the terminal and printed the boarding passes one hour prior to the takeoff. But the infrastructure in the airport, that works for Jet Blue, is so awfully bad that I missed the flight. The system doesn't print tags for luggage and nobody assists passengers. Finally, after a few attempts, we came to the service desk to print them, it was 50 minutes prior to takeoff. Then we spent over 20 minutes printing the tags, it's easy to see the timestamps on the tags. Finally, they didn't give us all our tags, one was missing! People were extremely slow then there was a glitch in the software, then the printer didn't work. Finally 25 minutes prior to takeoff we came to the security check, where we supposed to have a separate line. We didn't get it even after we told that we're missing the flight. The gate was closed strictly on time and we had to go to the Jet Blue service desk. 4. People at the desk saw right from the beginning all our statuses in the system and agreed that the was no our fault in this situation. They were not able to offer anything earlier than in 24 hours, but helped to identify all our luggage tags numbers and initiated the refund (appreciate it, however, I haven't got it so far). Everything else became our problem. 5. We tried to discuss the situation with the manager on site, but this step was absolutely useless. We were waiting for him for 40 minutes, a family of five people including a five-year-old child, that already supposed to be sleeping on the plane. He told us that he's sorry about what happened but didn't offer anything to compensate our losses (time and money for the tickets that we had to buy in the last minute and hotel). He didn't say anything regarding the enormous timeslots for the typical operations, that we saw. His point was that even if passengers paid for some services to get faster to the gate, one hour is not enough and we had to come earlier. But passengers should be notified about these critical issues in advance and have clear recommendations. And it doesn't mean that airlines are free from any obligations to support passengers on site. Nobody notified me that I had to plan 30-35 for each operation. I would never go for it. Overall conclusion: No way. Doesn't make sense to pay for the service if you can't get it. We had many examples of good and bad services, but this one is the worst experience that we had. All companies have problems but this time were had no support at all. In case of any troubles with Jet Blue you have reasons and explanation, but no help. They can tell you who's fault it is but they can't provide you anything after that happened. Special attitude exists only in their slogans. The worst example of low-cost with the prices of genuine airlines.",-1
2019-07-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,canceled with no explanation,False,"  Syracuse to Orlando. We have flown with JetBlue airways for years and usually have received adequate service. This year we received an email just 6 1/2 hours before our departure from Syracuse, NY informing us that the flight (#655) had been canceled with no explanation as to why? After further inquiry, we were told 2 things:  bad weather did not allow the aircraft to be sent north from Orlando the day previous to the scheduled departure date; and JetBlue did not have a pilot available to fly the aircraft north from Orlando. Imagine that?? Honestly, I think they just made up any old excuse. Regardless, I received an email 20 minutes later (approximately 6 hrs. before scheduled departure time) stating that they rescheduled our flight for 2 days later. Now there's a genius answer to their problem. Our family spent over $10,000 for a 2 week vacation to Florida only to have an airline cut the vacation short by 2 days because of their total screw up. Wow! Needless to say, we were not able to find any flights for 5 passengers and had to drive from Syracuse, NY to Orlando, FL. No big deal... it's only an 18 hour drive! Bottom line: I'm not sure who within JetBlue made this decision, but this experience for him/her is disgraceful in my opinion. The airline probably has just lost the trust of hundreds of potential customers because of your ingenious decision.",-1

2019-07-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Charlotte,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,used to be a good airline,True,"  New York to Charlotte. I've been a loyal jetblue customer for over a decade and they 'were' always my go-to airline. This changed on this flight from JFK to Charlotte that was delayed 6 hours. Now, we all know delays are possible and when they are based on weather or things not in an airlines control, you learn to deal with it. However, our actual plane was right there at JFK but it first had to take a plane load of people to Nantucket which apparently had a ground stop. The delay for that route went from 30 minutes, to an hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours. You see, instead of just cancelling the Nantucket flight and taking the us to Charlotte, we had to wait for that other flight on the plane we needed. Now considering this is their main hub, there has to be an extra plane and pilots (I'm told by someone in the industry that is typical). But let's put that aside, weather was good at JFK and weather was good in Charlotte, the issue is with an unrelated route which we now had to wait 6 hours. When you take the 6 hour wait, arriving at the airport an hour early and the 2 hour flight I essentially could have driven to Charlotte faster. Now consider their useless Jetblue 'Bill of Rights', since the ground stop was in Nantucket I was exempt from any money. So basically Jetblue will never give you money back, they will blame anything and anyone for their awful service. I contacted customer service who are useless, asked for a supervisor who after an hour gave up. I finally just emailed a list of execs at Jetblue and did get a useless response that did not address their issues. Jetblue used to be a good airline, if you have options, you may want to think about the fact your flight could be delayed by some other plane which in the case of my return flight was on the other side of the country.",-1

Today I went onto the JetBlue website to try to get a better seat and make final touch up since she needs wheelchair assist etc. On seat selection I was offered a wonderful seat in first row (1A with plenty leg room) so I paid extra $42 from the ATL-JFK leg and $50 for the JFK-ATL leg). I was not able to ask for special accommodations and I noticed that luggage was not included (what!). But I have no way to pay for luggage. So I opened up a chat window and a lady came on to help. She said I can add luggage and pay the fee on check in. I explained this is an 82 year old traveler and I want to make sure she is all set but with all the technology, JetBlue was not able to help me pay for this old lady luggage. I fail to understand from a programming point of view if I can pay for a better seat and the system can take credit cards, why can't I pay for luggage. Very disappointed, wont fly JetBlue again.",-1

This past two trips have been a nightmare. Their service agent at JFK was not very knowledgeable, had a short fuse, was rude to several passengers and just seemed very angry. I tried to go to another agent, but it seemed they all had a chip on their shoulder and where not very helpful. The JetBlue terminal HVAC system was not working and we could not wait to get onboard. Once onboard we thought that the nightmare was over. How wrong I was. The plane had engine problems and were directed to go back to JFK. Once their we were given these snack boxes that really were not very appealing. Not to mention the HVAC still has not been fixed. So the hours past (7 hours in total) in the sweltering heat of JFK JetBlue terminal. Finally they found a pilot to fly the airplane. The stewardess on the plane where OK. But not the way I’m used to JetBlue. I understand that issues happen, but their employees were downright mean and unhelpful throughout the entire ordeal. As a loyal customer with 100’s of thousands worth of points, I can honestly say that I will be giving another airline a try for the first time. Flight 369 June 5.",-1

I wanted to take 3 bags on carry on, they said it was full and I had to pay $130 for all bags to be checked In. Then our plane was delayed over an hour and a half and right before we switched terminals 3 times, they offered everyone in front of me to check their bag below the plane for free cause the carry on was full. So I called to Jetblue and the person was rude and didn’t care.  I waited a few days and I called back again and spoke to a pleasant person and I told her I didn’t want to get mad but I would like a refund for the $90 of the 3 carry on’s I had. She spoke to her supervisor and they offered me a credit of $130 but I don’t travel often and I had 364 days to use it.  I asked again for my $90 refund and the supervisor only gave me a half refund.",-1

What I don’t understand is how you have to sit on the plan an extra hour after the delay with no information. And then wait an hour plus on the plane when we land to get off. Literally have been sitting on this plane for 2.5 hours with everyone on board for no explainable reason. Terrible.,1

Gate agents were overzealous in enforcing the carrying bags. I was carrying 2 bags and a paper bag that was 1 inch thick and 4 inches tall which I could have placed in my jacket pocket and was told that I had to check it in or one of my other bags. I understand the two bag policy, however that's what I call splitting hairs which leaves a bad taste for JetBlue Airlines. I can now understand why JetBlue only has a three star rating. The service by the gate agents needs to be improved.",-1

Today was the final straw when they didn’t load my bag and they don’t have enough people to find out where it is. Flights are delayed and not because of weather. They have definitely gone downhill in the last year or so.,-1

Been a member since 2013 for the past two or three years my work schedule has been destroyed because of their delays constant excuses for the delay. My flight was scheduled for 5:00 pm. Now it’s 12:02am the next day. Sat in the airport for 6 hours. Constant lying about the reasons for delay. Their fleet is short servicing the number of people flying. It may be true for other airlines. But my wife has no issues with United Airlines. Always fly on time. Sad about JetBlue.,-1

They closed the doors as we approached the gate and told us to reschedule. Then she opened the door for the pilots and repeated for us to reschedule tho the plane hadn’t taken off. We watched this  worker close the door in our face. Next flight wasn’t until 9 hours later. Flight attendants were rude in the oncoming flights I will never recommended or book this Arline again.

I have flown JetBlue exclusively due to service but will no longer fly with them. My recent flight was nearly 3 hrs delayed. Moreover, my bag (checked) was severely damaged during flight. The pull handle completely snapped off. The bag is relatively new and excellent quality (Victorinox). JetBlue would not replace the bag and merely offered a $200 flight credit which expires in 1 year. I do not anticipate taking a flight within the next year so this credit is completely useless. Meanwhile I will need to shell out $400 to replace my suitcase. Terrible customer service.",-1

My 4 year year old daughter and I were traveling home from a vacation in Long Beach. Somehow JetBlue gave away my daughter's seat so we were forced to wait in the airport for over 4 hours for another flight. The worst part is that Jetblue continued to indicate that I should have saved out boarding passes to my wallet on iPhone. They maintained this not their fault and that I should be thankful they ""could book us on a later flight at all"". Being separated from the rest of our party, having my daughter cry because she was separated from our nanny, spending 4 extra hours in an airport was frustrating enough but to have customer service agents repeatedly be condescending and rude was too much.",-1

This airline allows the rear of the plane to board first and allows this passengers to put carry on luggage in the front cabinets. This prevents others from having room for their carry on pieces and causes them to put their pieces in the back of the plane. Why not load front to back or keep cabinet doors closed to those passengers in the back preventing them from using the front cabinets? This is completely inconvenient and poorly managed.,-1

2019-05-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to West Palm Beach,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,way I was treated with my dog,False,"  Boston to West Palm Beach. I flew up to Boston on Spirit, I thought that was the worst of my trip (however, there was no charge for my emotional support dog to accompany me with Spirit), then I used JetBlue for my trip back home. The attendant at the counter told me I had to go over to another counter for my dog to board, but didn't tell me he needed to have his bag. His bag was in my check in bag. So, I went over to the other counter where I was told that he needed his bag, so they called to have my check in bag sent to the customer service desk one flight below the ticket counter. I had an emotional support dog with me and his certificate, shot record and special vest on him and because I didn't have the information on ""their forms"" I was charged $125.00 or that he could be put in the cargo bay with the luggage. Also, we were put through a separate line for security, which my son and I thought would take a shorter time. The TSA agents knew we were now late in getting to our gate, and made it impossible to get quickly thru the screening and we missed our flight. So we had to re-book to the next flight leaving. Then when landing, I was told that my emotional support dog had to be put back down into his bag. Since he is an ""emotional support"" animal, I should have been allowed to keep him with me on my lap! People with babies hold them on their lap, they aren't told the baby can't stay on their lap! The airline had changed the way they handle support dogs last year, I hadn't used JetBlue in years, nor will I ever fly with them again. I should receive my $125.00 back with an apology from this company for the way I was treated with my dog. I am 65 year senior citizen. I should not have been treated this way by the airline. I will never fly, nor will I recommend anyone I know ever to fly JetBlue.",-1

I’ve flown a lot, with many different airlines, and I’ve never had an overall worse experience. Constant delays, not only on my own flights, but on others in my terminal. The delays caused me to miss my connection, and I was stuck in Fort Lauderdale for 24 hours. No compensation for my work damages for missing a work trip. Not even compensation for the hotel and cabs I had to get for the 24 hours stuck. They acted like it was a miracle I could even get on a flight the next day. Will not be flying with JetBlue again.",-1

Whether it is New York, Miami, Charleston, Aruba, Boston, etc., they continuously push flights back with zero explanation. The staff is never helpful in providing information, and are often incredibly rude and dismissive. I have missed several events due to their delays. Other airlines remain on schedule but it seems as though jet blue does not know how to operate a business for repeat customers. I would never recommend flying with them if you want to get to your destination in a reasonable time.",-1

But the weather was perfect in New York and Aruba. They just kept delaying no explanation. Nothing offered. Their policy is terrible your flight can be delayed with out any reimbursement if its coming from bad weather. Perfect excuse to avoid taking care of customers. Free wifi that never works. Food is terrible. This happens all the time now with JetBlue.,-1

Horrible decision to leave families stuck in an airport on a holiday with no explanation to why but “maintenance problems”. Every hour they have pushed my flight back one hour since 7AM its now 5PM still no update to when I'll be out of here. This was my nieces first time on a plane and shes only 10 yrs old and even she thought this was a horrible experience!,-1

JetBlue is perhaps the worst airlines I personally have ever had the displeasure of doing business with. They made the entire group wait 28 1/2 hours with little to no explanation and constant lies and misinformation. No hotel vouchers, no food, and an overbooked flight the next day. I was booked on a Friday flight at 2 PM and started receiving delays of 230 that morning . After arriving to the airport they kept bumping our flight due to a flight delay elsewhere. Then when the plane arrived they changed our gate we all rushed down there to find out that our pilots had left. After two hours more of waiting we were told that the pilots had arrived but the weather was then too bad. After six hours of waiting I decided to go home and rebook on the next flight out which was the same time the next day when the weather was to be beautiful. Thank goodness I live close by and I could do this. Most of the passengers had an awful time trying to get hotels in the area and of course they had to pay for them! The next day I went back for the same terrible treatment. I was told it was going to be an hour late before I got to the airport, then after I was at the airport another mishap and the plane was out of service With no replacement. We were told it would be another 3 to 5 hours of waiting. I was to attend a surprise birthday party for my cousin at 6 o’clock and the plane wouldn’t even be arriving until 830 so with a half an hour drive I would miss it entirely! People missed weddings because of this debacle. Southwest never skipped a beat and kept going through all of the weather and had no delays at all from Fort Lauderdale to Nashville. I will never use JetBlue again. They offered me nothing but a refund on my ticket. Nothing to cover my lost rental car, my hotel for two nights, or the grief and embarrassment over not making it to our family gathering. Never again!",-1

",True,"  Have been flying Jetblue since inception as they were the premier airlines in its category. Over the last few months the airline has deteriorated rapidly. From simple things such as TVs not working to old planes in fleet since inception. The worst is that most flight scheduled have been either changed slightly or by hours. As a business person going by a schedule, to change flight times is extremely disruptive. We are going to change the way we do business with this dysfunctional airline.",-1

We called JetBlue to book our seats immediately after we booked our all inclusive trip with using JetBlue (as we always use them But never will again). They told us that we had to wait until 24 hours before to book our seats or we would pay extra, interesting. This has never been the way it worked previous, seeing as we take a few trips a Year And we try to fly JetBlue (not anymore Of course And it seems from the reviews that JetBlue doesn’t care About customer satisfaction anymore). Families were scattered everywhere ... even 5 year olds By themselves. But the worst was on our way back. There were not enough seats when we went on to book 24 hours Before the flight, so I chatted with this women, and saved our chat for social Media. Jetblue used to have great customer service. This lady was not professional or helpful. Said we should just go to the airport, JetBlue never fully books. Well we chose To pay $30 Extra each so we could get home safely in time. Again, family’s complaining, everyone split up. Today, I get a text from my co worker, JetBlue overbooked. People have to give up their seats, her being one of them. Never using JetBlue again. Oh and your TV didn’t work on both  flights. On the way back they rebooted so they began to work but they weren’t playing the movies that were supposed to be playing. So I sat there and starred at the ceiling for 4 hours.",-1

Almost every time there’s a delay and normally they’re not 30 or 40 minutes no, it’s 1:30 to 2 hours delays. Upon checking online I finally came to my conclusion about this airline, on money magazine there’s an article where they are placed last and it comes to delays and cancellations, worse then Spirit, unbelievable but true. Stick with Delta, yes they have delays as I have experienced, but they were due to snow storms, never anything else.",-1

Explains weather related delays but flight at the gate for past 2 hours ready with no crew members. Apparently they have no pilots or crew members to run the route. The fight has changed times over 5 times from 6:58 to 9:13 to 8:58 to 10:15 and finally to 11:15 still in the waiting area with no further info on the crew and if the flight is going to be delayed any further.,-1

Please be advised that Jetblue is not honouring flight in or out of JFK and are not informing customers but simply cancelling the flight. This has been the biggest disappointment thus far as my husband and I are trying to travel home for my grandfather's funeral. They are not providing us with a reasonable explanation as to why this is happening and are giving us a hard time with reimbursing the money we have already spent on our round trip flight. This is completely unacceptable and I advise you to think twice, no three times about booking a flight with this airline. Their communication is not what it should be especially when customers are already in route with their traveling plans. They will take your money and not refund it when it is reasonably owed to you. This is not how you conduct business at all.",-1

My brothers and sisters and I missed my mother’s surprise 80th birthday party in July 2017 and now in her time of death we were delayed getting to her last Thursday and now we are trying to get home post her death and it’s a 4 hours delay. Completely unacceptable. Completely unreliable. Worst airline ever for onTime performance. No compassion. The employees on the ground unhelpful. Simply saying all flight in and out of JFK are delayed. Not what I need to hear and would have appreciated knowing that upfront. Like I’m an idiot for not knowing this. But a complete lie as the plane that left NY after my flight arrived pretty much on time. Still waiting in the airport. JetBlue Your the worst. Thank for being consistently unreliable.

I abstained from speaking to the people on the flight and the people at the front desk at the airport, as I know they do not have any say as to what was happening. This flight experience was poorly addressed and handled and the small $400 credit they sent in an email I do not feel is suitable compensation. Due to the lack of the airline getting me back to Phoenix on-time, I had to miss an important meeting with my business consultant that flew in from Maryland to meet with me. This cost me far more than $400! Not only that, the airline did not start telling people they would put them up in a hotel until 11pm, after they had us sitting on the runway for 4 hours! I had already left and checked in to the Comfort Inn and Suites, which they did reimburse me for after I wrote about my experience to their customer service. This delay had nothing to due with weather, it had to due with the poor scheduling of pilots on the plane that were ended up not being able to fly because their flight time ran out while we sat on the runway waiting for take-off! Absolutely horrible experience and their customer service continued to give me the same run around emails and they even had other people email me claiming they were supervisors and stating the exact same regards for my poor experience but there is nothing else they can do and they feel they have already compensated me fairly with their pathetic $400 credit.",-1

I didn't have another bag to move the over 8lbs over, so I was told I could not get on the plane or I could buy another flight for my bag. I will never fly this airline again.

She brought all her current paperwork completed by her doctor and vet proving her dog was a service dog. They allowed her to bring her dog on the plane as a service dog from Fort Lauderdale to White Plains and ensured her she would not have any issues on her return flight back home. When she got to the airport for her return flight the Supervisor (Anna Mane) would not accept any of her paperwork and told her she can pay $125 for her dog & buy a $50 kennel or she will have to get additional paperwork completed by her doctor and reschedule her trip back home (this was a Sunday night so no way to resolve the paperwork issue at the time). My mom is a senior citizen that has a serious medical condition that is triggered when she is under high level of anxiety or stress and it could cause her to go into the hospital. Her dog does not only help prevent a medical issue, but also lets her know when one is coming so she can take her medicine. I tried to talk to the Supervisor and she apologized for the confusion their airline may have caused, but was not willing to work with us in any way. I explained we had two weeks before my mom's return flight so if they would have told us in Florida to get another form filled out by her doctor we would have without any problem. Why would the paperwork be acceptable one way, but rejected on the return flight two week later? When I told the Supervisor she is putting my mom through unnecessary stress that could cause my mom to have a medical issue, she threaten to not let me my travel without a full medical review just to be even more nasty. My mom paid the extra money so she would not miss her flight, but the Supervisor had a flight attendance harass her on the plane to ensure she kept her service dog in the kennel. My mom has travel on jetblue plenty of times before with her service dog and never had any issues. The flight attendant actually told her and the people sitting around her that my mom was trying to pass her dog as a service dog, but he wasn't. Her dog is a service dog and just because there was a misunderstanding that does not give them the airline staff the right to harass and embarrass her when she did provide significant proof that she does have a medical condition that requires her to have her dog with her at all times. Her dog has never been put in a kennel so he was also impacted by how unprofessional the staff at JetBlue treated him and his owner. I can understand the potential risk if my mom's service dog was a pit bull, but my mom's service dog is 5 lbs and has a history with the airline traveling with her as a service dog. We contacted the corporate office to put in a complaint on how she was treated and to get the opportunity to provide the doctor's paperwork they wanted so she could get reimbursed for what she was forced to pay and they rejected her request and did not even give her the opportunity to prove that her dog is a service dog. The person sitting next to my mom on the airplane is also putting in a formal complaint on how badly my mom was treated. I have always had a good experience with JetBlue, but after how badly my mom was treated and they had no concern for her health, I can not travel with them again. The corporate office was not willing to even try to make the situation right by allowing her to prove she has a service dog to get her money back.",-1

Last 4 times I have flown this route there have been issues. This and last three Returning to gate after taxing out to get the rest of the baggage. Really? Last week flight was delayed two and one half hours with no explanation and after finally landing we waited on the tar mat for 45 minutes because there was a broken plane at our gate! Again really? You can’t make this stuff up. Oh and by the way they over booked the flight I am on now and we’re trying this special offer to anyone stupid enough to answer” If you would give up your seat Jet Blue will compensate you by flying you to aFort Lauderdale tomorrow during the snow storm ugh not even the right destination.,-1

Found out they delay this flight and the flight after it by three hours nearly every week. The will blame this on the weather and give waiting passengers a free water and box of snacks. This feels like to me more of a tactic to save money by using the same flight crew for both the three o’clock and seven o’clock flights. There are so few passengers, they are hemorrhaging money and they don’t care about the fee passengers they sold goods to. I find this despicable.",-1

They left us stranded for 4 hrs before I had to cancel my flight. Very unprofessional. People at the terminal were rude. Gave no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Just said to wait. I have been a loyal customer for years. We fly our employees and family on multiple trips every year. I will no longer use this airline. Why pay top dollar for bad service.,-1
2019-02-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,Back to Delta I go,True,"  Flight scheduled from Syracuse to San Francisco with a layover in JFK. The flight was scheduled for 9AM and was delayed 8 times. We finally left at 1:18PM, but my connecting flight (for 2:59PM) had just left the gate as we were landing. At this point, I was sent to the help desk to reschedule my flight -  which ended up being a 9:15PM flight. At this point, I’d already spent 8 hours in the airport and I’ll be spending another 6 hours here until the next flight. All of which was due a maintenance delay. I returned to the help desk to ask for a food voucher which I know they’ll give to people who miss their flights due to JetBlue’s issues. I was told they do not give out vouchers due to weather. I explained to the woman that my flight was delayed in Syracuse due to JetBlue’s airplane maintenance issues, not the weather, so she made a phone call. Apparently their response to me was, “we don’t have any food vouchers right now.”. So what JetBlue is telling me, that for spending 14 hours in the airport due to their own maintenance issues causing me to miss my flight, they’re too cheap to spare a measly $10 food voucher for me to feed myself just once in the meantime. Let alone any other accommodations. Back to Delta I go.",-1

Our family of 7 flew Jet Blue home from a Disney World vacation in Orlando. This was our first time flyers with Jet Blue. We got a great deal and decided to try. JetBlue was a dream come true airline. We give it a A plus all the way. The seats and legroom was much bigger, the checkin was awesome, baggage check no brained. We loved having Dunkin Donut coffee served and loved having a great assortment of snacks offered for the trip home. Free WiFi, the kids watched cartoons and it kept them busy. The concourse was new and not nearly as crowded in Atlanta. We liked that we could already book our seats when we purchased since we were traveling with children. They allowed us to board early and get settled. Perfect all the way. It will be our choice for the future trips.",1

We got to San Jose and our 10:42pm flight got bumped to 4:45am. They told us there was absolutely nothing they could do for us. Though we were traveling with a 2 year old. And if they hadn’t called us 2 hours before our flight back in November 2018 it wouldn’t be as bad. But messing up our flights twice in 3 months is a little ridiculous! And in November we were going on a cruise and they also told us there was nothing they could do for us. Jet blue is a terrible airline and I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone. I will never fly Jetblue again!!,-1
2019-02-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,read the fine print,False,  Buffalo to Orlando. Booked through Expedia with there travel protection. Had to cancel with the comfort of knowing we could. When we went to use our credit we realized it was only worth half of what our total cost was. Then we were seven days past the date and they wouldn’t even let us use that. Customer service was rude! After calling each Expedia and Jet Blue multiple times we figured out it was Jetblue who wouldn’t issue the credit. Very frustrating but probably the reason they are said to be the worst airline. They are going to scam you so make sure you read the fine print.,-1
2019-02-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Nassau via Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,is the worst experience,False,"  This is my first and last time ever flying JetBlue. Thanks for ruining my honeymoon. From the very beginning it has been awful and has turned into a nightmare since then and unfortunately we’re not even done yet... First we needed a name added to our ticket and for 5 hours were bounced back and forth between JetBlue and Expedia. JetBlue repeatedly told me there was nothing they could do and then finally made the change after 5 hours of hair pulling insanity. While at the airport they told us our flight was so delayed we’d miss our connection through Ft. Lauderdale and rerouted is on a later flight through Boston—now putting us in 3 hours later to the Bahamas. Even that flight is now delayed over an hour and we land in Boston and run to the gate where a JetBlue employee immediately tells us that it’s too late to board and that it was our fault we missed the plane because we’ve been at the airport for over an hour. We spent several minutes arguing with her that we just barely arrived and ran straight to this gate but she was convinced we’d been at the airport for over an hour until she finally saw that we were right on her computer. We had to go to someone else to rebook our flight and now we have yet another connection through Ft. Lauderdale (our original connection) and we are getting into the Bahamas over 8 hours late. And by the way, while we were staring at the check in desk in SLC for 30 minutes waiting for them to finally figure out our ticket, every other person who checked in for various other flights were also told their flights were delayed. To top it off the plane was old and uncomfortable. So JetBlue single-handedly slashed our honeymoon by 25% because were losing the whole day and all they offer us is a cheap airport meal voucher. Thanks for everything JetBlue, including making my wife cry. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline and they continue to keep messing things up so I’m stuck in Boston fully expecting to miss more flights and keep getting rerouted. I’ll be asking them to book me on a different airline on the way back but I expect more ridiculous excuses.",-1

Even the extra room seats aren't the most comfortable, but that's the same anywhere except on some ""luxury"" airlines. The only problem is that everyone brings a ""carry-on"", some elephant sized and the overheads fill quickly. Also probably the same with every domestic.",1
2019-01-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Boston,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Ridiculous organization,False,"  Baltimore to Boston. First and last time with this airline. For a two day trip: the first flight was delayed by 4+ hours, the return flight by 2 hours. They waited for all of us to board, and only then calmly announced that there were no overhead bins empty. Instead of letting the front crew know if the issue, they let more people come in, so there's a whole bunch of us standing there with out suitcases in our hands! They then made us go back and check our luggage. Ridiculous organization is an understatement. Will avoid this airline whenever possible.",-1
2019-01-25,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Seattle,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,everything went smooth,True," Flying from New York JFK to Seattle on a morning flight. Since this was my first domestic flight in the USA I was suprised by JetBlue. Almost everything went smooth. Checkin was easy and I was approach by the staff for handling my bag. The aircraft was new and very clean. Legroom was more then OK and larger compared to European carriers in economy class. Inflight entertaint is first class on JetBlue. A wide variety in tv-shows, movies, live television and free wifi onboard which worked surprisingly fast. During the flight there were multiple rounds with free drinks and snacks and the crew was friendly. In case you needed more drinks, you could get it for free in the aft galley. The flight was on-time and landed ahead of schedule. The only downside of this flight was SEA airport. There was no parking spot available at the main terminal so the aircraft had to park at a remote stand somewhere far away. Then ground crew couldn’t attach traditional airstrairs to the aircraft because there was no room due to vehicles airport vehicles standing in the way. It took at least 40 minutes before we could leave the plane. Not JetBlue’s fault. Next time I will fly JetBlue again when flying domestic in the USA.",1

2019-01-23,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to Bridgetown via New York,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,3,never fly Jetblue in winter,True,"  Syracuse to Bridgetown via New York. Do yourself a favor and never fly Jetblue in winter. Outgoing leg from Syracuse to Barbados via JFK was uneventful except they transposed my last and middle names on the reservation, causing a slight delay in boarding at JFK. Was able to sleep more or less comfortably in regular coach seat during overnight JFK-BGI leg. However, at 3:42 AM on morning of departure from BGI (Saturday 1/19), I received an email and text that the BOS-SYR leg of my return trip had been delayed 2 whole dats. This was due to anticipated winter weather (Winter Storm “Harper,” how I hate these stupid names). No way to reach anyone on the phone (hung up after 45 minutes on hold). At BGI, I pleaded to be stuck there instead of frigid Boston, but they could not accommodate me until Wednesday 1/23 (and with a fee despite “fee waiver”). My emailed complaints did get me a $300 credit (half of total airfare). Cluster on Monday 1/21 as 10:50 PM BOS-SYR flight was repeatedly delayed until finally being canceled at 2:24 AM. Due to numerous delayed/canceled B6 flights, there was a mad rush for transportation, meaning no Ubers and an over-an-hour wait in single-digit cold for cabs. Despite cancellation being due to crew timeout, ground staff still termed it a weather delay and offered no compensation beyond refunds. My flight was then delayed to Wednesday 1/23, but I rented a car and drove home. Most other major airlines were operating at least some flights from SYR and BOS during this spell of winter weather. But B6 preemptively canceled ALL BOS flights-no excuse for this!",-1
2019-01-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,absolutely unreliable,False," New York to Las Vegas. As one of the many people which flights were cancelled during a non existent snow storm in NYC I would like to express my disappointment about this absolute unnecessary cancellation policy. We did not receive 1 inch of snow here in NYC and there was absolutely no reason other than missmanagement which caused this conflict. While all other airlines continued to fly out, Jetblue stoppend and did not offer any option for rescheduling the flight as after the holiday weekend. In my case I had to cancel my entire trip, which was carefully plannned without any reason. Airlines should be made accountable for their mismanagement, cost for not cancelling of accomendations and lost time. It is rediculos that they can cancel without reason, refund, not even trying to solve the situation and provide an rescheduled flight within an day and continue. I will warn everybody to fly with Jetblue. This airline is absolutely unreliable.",-1

The airplane and ride overall were fine but there was this screen in my face playing the same commercials on a loop that was extremely annoying. More like torture. There was no apparent button to turn it off so I resorted to place my jacket over the screen in my face but still the screens from the other seats bothered me. This is evil in my opinion. Screen are ok as long as people are able to shut the off.,-1

When I arrived at the airport I was not allowed to take the third bag I was told by the representative on the phone that I could if I paid $100.00 extra. I checked ahead of time to be sure that it was no issue. Also they did not let me pay extra for a 5lb over bag. The bags all three of them were for people in need and not myself. This is a very unaccommodating airline with very poor customer service and inaccurate information! I'm very disappointed.,-1
2018-12-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Jacksonville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Will never use Jetblue again,True, New York to Jacksonville. I had to fly with my wife from JAX to JFK. She had to change her last name for the ticket and Delta did it for free and in a timely manner. Jetblue had us on the phone playing phone tag and we had to pay over $200 dollars to fix the ticket. We used Jetblue to fly back to Jax and our seats were together before they issued us a new ticket. The flight with the new tickets had us sitting separate and they want to charge us again for something we already had. Guess what Delta changed our seats for free. Delta gave us an emergency exit seat so I could be with my wife and it was more roomy. Delta really takes care of their customers while Jetblue only cares about the money. Will never use Jetblue again. And I hear that a lot. Should have listened. I will tell everyone I know not to use Jetblue. Also the flight was delayed and we arrived early with Delta. Why would anyone use this airline? I wish I could give zero stars.,-1

They kept us informed of what was going on. When we arrived in Ft. Lauderdale, US border control took over 90 minutes to stamp our passports. The bags did make it, but nobody from jetBlue was available at the baggage recheck desk, so we had to make our own way out the door of Terminal 3 and over to Terminal 4 to speak with someone. When we reached the counter, the staff had already arranged for another flight to leave the next day and had booked a hotel for us with vouchers for meals. This was nice, but the lower dollar amount of the vouchers meant we had to eat cheap food. The next day, we took off on time. Overall, the staff at jetBlue were professional, but there was a lack of hustle after the delayed flight arrived Havana as well as a lack of personnel with whom to speak directly outside of customs upon arrival in FLL. Inflight wifi did not work on a couple of our flights, and the video screens did not work on a couple of segments. Overall, the carrier seems sloppy.",-1

They told me that there was no room for my carry-on. As I walked to my seat there were 22 empty spots I had to go to baggage claim with an injury as they were too lazy to check if there were open available overhead space. There was a space free above my seat for the whole flight. Seriously if you want unhappy customers who won’t come back, this is the way to do it.",-1

My husband and I booked tickets to Jamaica for our honeymoon through an all inclusive website and our tickets and flight was booked with JetBlue. (Through the website bookit) We were supposed to fly out the 9th but was stuck on traffic because of weather conditions on the way and we missed our international flight to Jamaica. We contacted our representative from bookit because we were told by the JetBlue employee at the airport she didn’t have access to our tickets and she was locked out so she couldn’t do anything. We got the tickets unlocked by the bookit representative, and the JetBlue employee changed our departing flight to Jamaica for the following day, the 10th with no charge. We were told the bookit representative had to change our returning flight home so to take care of that with them. My husband and I fly out the following day, the 10th and arrive in Jamaica and haven’t heard from anyone about changing our departing flight home. We contact bookit, they call JetBlue who calls the insurance (we payed an extra $300 for insurance when booking our honeymoon) and no one can change our returning tickets. The resort and excursions pushed everything back a day because we were missing a paid for night ($350 per person plus $150 per person for the excursion). When talking to JetBlue, bookit and insurance the only options were to pay for new tickets plus a fee to leave on the 16th or leave the 15th, and lose out on a night at the resort and an excursion. I will never fly with JetBlue again because of their customer service.",-1

The second time, she came for a snack serving and she asked me, Do you need a snack and I told yes. She again asked me what snack you need specifically sir and I asked what are the snack you have. She told with bold tone, it is already announced in the flight sir, don't you hear and later she said, Chips, Pretzel etc. I told Chips.

The departing time on the itinerary was different to the one on the boarding pass, we never received a notification and due to this we missed our flight. Not only were we provided with wrongful information without any flight time change updates but staff tried to convince me and my girlfriend that we were at fault. Claiming they could not do anything for us. We expressed we were not from New York and basically had nowhere to go, the response was “I’m sorry but there is nothing I can do for you.” We decided to talk to the manager on duty she allowed one of the representatives to be rude to us and basically gave us the same response. All JetBlue did for us was provide us with a flight for the following day and after spending all day out keeping ourselves busy and coming back to spend the night at the airport JetBlue said we had to come back the day the flight was departing (meaning we were not allowed to spend the night at the airport).",-1

This is the most unprofessional airline, I would rather pay twice the amount for a ticket then fly with this airline ever again. I have 2 small kids & all out seats were scrambled. I checked in at the kiosk & the kiosk said I could pick seats together. Then some rude customer svc agent told me i would have to get them assigned at the gate. So we get to the gate, I talk to another rep at the check in desk & she tells me to come back in 15 min. I went back 15 min later to be told by the same person oh, I'm not working this flight, you will have to come back when another person arrives. 20 min later another lady came & I went back to the desk to be told oh, I'm not online yet go have a seat. There was no smile, no nothing. So them the idiot makes an announcement the luggage can be checked at the gate because they might run out of space. Then 5 min later she announces my name over the intercom so I go up with a bag I was going to voluntarily check, she practically slams our 4 boarding passes on the counter & says, here's your seats. I told her I wanted to check a bag, she literally looks at me & says, go stand back in line, there are people ahead of you. She is the one that called me to the counter, she  obviously has my info pulled up so print a check bag ticket! I wasn't standing back in that line. That's where being nice will get you, nowhere with this stupid customer svc rep! Jet Blue need to train your customer svc reps on how to have a nicer attitude!

Aside from those perks, the flight was smooth and they give you a fresh hot towel at the end of the flight.

This is my first and last time using Jet Blue Airlines. Today I had a 6.30 am flight to catch with my infant son. Flight duration 2.5hrs. After boarding on time and about to take off, they pilot announced there was an issue with a valve. We ended up deplaning and they said the flight would be 1-2 hours delayed. It was a pain but manageable. However 3 hours later they announce we'll be delayed another 3 hours. It's ridiculous. The weather is perfectly fine. This is an issue on their end that they should have tested in advance. Such an early morning flight. If we'd known in good time we would be 6 hours delayed because of an issue on THEIR end, we could have at the minimum slept in and had a more relaxing morning to then show up on time for the flight. This is an issue that sounds liked it could have been avoided if they were better prepared. Highly disappointed",-1

While traveling on Jetblue Airways with my wedding gown and grooms attire, I was taken back by the lack of support from the flight staff to accommodate our request. Not only was the attendant not helpful he did not come up with any alternative options. I understand safety is the main priority. However our flight was not full and hanging the garments was possible, the exception was the unwillingness of the attendant to be solution oriented. Instead he crushed my dress over another passengers luggage in an overhead bin. Now I have to hold back the tears and pray that the resort can fix our attire for your special day.",-1

It was a very short flight, less than 1 hour but the service was great. The check in was very easy by the app, in the airport a little trouble with the machine and my luggage but it was solved in 5 minutes by the staff. The seat is perfect for a short flight and is great they still have inflight service in domestic flights. I hope I can fly with this airline in a longer flight.",1

Also don’t bother asking for a manager, the employee that closed the flight early refused to show his ID and an NYPD officer had to make him give it to us. By the way we later found out that he was the manager! Meanwhile the flight was delayed for another 30 minutes so it sat in the gate while we found another manager to help us but by that time it was too late.",-1

2018-11-02,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Fort Lauderdale,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5,"rude, ignorant and unprofessional",True,"  On October 29, I was flying to Boston, Ma to see my son who I’d not seen in months so we could visit college campuses on the 29th and the 30th. I arrived at the airport the morning of the 29th and when I tried to check in the associate at the customer service desk told me I was not booked on the 7:30 AM flight but instead I was booked on the 7:15 PM flight. I asked if there was an earlier flight I could be moved to and I explained my travel purposes to her. She very kindly made a phone call to get permission to move me to the 7:30 AM flight explaining I’d not seen my son in months. She even advocated to waive the fee normally charged for a flight transfer and subsequently was able to do so. I was so happy and so grateful, I thanked her several times and proceeded to the TSA check in, boarded my flight and continued to enjoy my travel experience. When I returned to Boston Logan Airport to travel home again I was met with a flight delay which was not the biggest deal to me, I made the best of the extra time and opted to go into one of the restaurants and grab a bite to eat. I returned to the boarding gate shortly thereafter where I sat waiting to be called for boarding. After sitting for approximately ten minutes a JetBlue staff member (who said he was in charge) came over and began questioning me about how many drinks I’d consumed. I told him I had been drinking the Lipton Iced Tea in the bottle I was holding but not been consumed any alcoholic beverages. He asked if I’d had anything to eat and I explained I had grabbed a burger at the airport while I was waiting and I gave him the name of the restaurant so he could verify where I’d been and what I consumed but he continued questioning me in front of the other passengers to the point where the conversation turned argumentative. After he succeeded in making me feel like a spectacle he proceeded back to the desk by the gate. He returned to where I was sitting a couple of minutes later and proceeded to tell me in front of all the other passengers that I was a danger to the flight and it was his job to determine what my level of intoxication might be and he told me he was going to make sure no one on the flight crew served me any alcohol. Again, despite feeling attached I tried to assure him I had not been drinking. I expressed my confusion over where his allegations were coming from and told him about how happy I was with my experience having my flight transferred the day before. Eventually after telling me I smelled of alcohol (from two seats away) he went back to the desk next to the gate. When I stood in the line to board the flight he pulled me out of the line and asked me to stand by the desk. He called someone he said was his supervisor and turned his back to me and continued to say I was drunk posed a safety hazard. After all the other passengers boarded he allowed me to board the flight and made a sarcastic comment about how happy I was with the customer service at JetBlue. I did let him know I’d heard everything he said on the phone and my review to the airline would not be 100% positive as I found him to be rude, ignorant and unprofessional. He stopped me from boarding again and continued with an argumentative tone to tell me he was just doing his job. He proceeded to follow me onto the plane where he notified every crew member he felt I was drunk and a danger to the flight.",1

Awful, disrespectful, prejudice and arrogant staff / management.  JetBlue employee was not updating their monitor, which I rely on because of my hearing disability, and blamed me for not using “my other senses,” to understand that my Group was boarding.

This is my second encounter with JetBlue, and I truly fall more in love with the airline each time. The flight attendants are so incredibly accommodating and really care about and enforce safety protocol better than any others I've seen! You get the whole can of soda if you want, you can take three snacks from the basket. Legroom is superior to any other short-medium haul carrier in the states. IFE is not stellar, but hell it's there and you get live DirectTV and a decent map feature. And free WiFI that was plenty fast, enough to be able to watch YouTube! I will definitely be going out of my way to fly with JetBlue in the future.",1
2018-10-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Raleigh-Durham via New York,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3,disappointing customer service,False,"  Salt Lake City to Raleigh-Durham via New York. I flew on standby on my most recent trip with Jetblue. I've flown standby many times and I am used to not always getting on the first time I go to the airport but this time was ridiculous. I attempted to leave on a Tuesday evening and at the very last second before the flight was closing its doors, I was told it was my lucky day and I got one of the last seats on the plane because someone didn't show up. I was printed a new ticket with my name and seat assignment, checked my carry on (since they ran out of overhead bin space), found my seat and buckled up. I sat there patiently waiting for take off when a stewardess/flight attendant came and told me the other person showed up and needed their seat back! They escorted me off the plane, gave me my bag back, and sent me on my way. They should not have been able to take me off the plane and give my seat away once they established the previous customer did not get the seat anymore and printed a new ticket with my name and that seat assignment. After three days of waiting on standby and being rolled over, I finally got a seat on a plane to JFK where I was supposed to connect to RDU and finally get home. When I arrived to JFK I found out the attendants that were rolling over my flight the previous days did not roll over my connecting flight each time like they should have (or at least they should have notified me I needed to talk to the proper people to get them rolled over) so I had to run all over the airport looking for someone who could help me get on the next flight out. Every person I dealt with that worked for Jetblue was rude to me, cut me off mid-sentence thinking they knew what i was asking before I could finish, or acted like I was at fault for not doing what I was supposed to (even though I was never notified of an issue and if I ever asked questions i was immediately cut off or rushed away so I didn't have to be dealt with). Jetblue treats their customers like second class citizens, even when they pay the full priced more expensive tickets like I have on previous occasions. On top of all this, I've also had luggage damaged when flying with them that they refused to take responsibility for. They have nice planes but the disappointing customer service and problems they have caused me when trying to travel have definitely turned me off of ever flying with them again!",-1

2018-10-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nassau to New York JFK,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,by far the worst experience,True,  Nassau to New York JFK. This is by far the worst experience I had with jet blue. Also like to fly with them but on the way back to the Bahamas there was engine failure. The flight was canceled. On top of that they wanted us to fly out the next morning to FL then catch a flight from FL back to JFK. I booked a non stop ticket and we wanted to get home. So we had to fly to FL and then go back to JFK the same day. Did not get in til 12:30 and got home at 2 AM. Called them up to see what they can do for us and they ended up giving us 175 per person credit. That will expire in 365 days and we have to fly with them again. This really did put a bad taste in my mouth after flying with them for so long. I don’t think I would ever fly with them again. They can take the 175 credit and eat it. All the hours I spent at the airport and had to do a layover to get home and I get 175 back. Total joke! I guess JetBlue does not care about customer service. I hope my story would help other people out before the book JetBlue.,-1
2018-10-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Westchester,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Will never fly them again,True,"  Tampa to Westchester. This was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. First, our flight was delayed again and again and again, a total of 6 hours until they finally cancelled our flight at midnight. For hours they knew that there wasn't going to be a crew to fly us back as the crew timed out do to weather in NY and the jetblue employees chose to lie to everyone for hours pretending like we would be flying out that night. When our plane finally arrived at 11pm they told us it would be a quick turnaround and they would get us on board knowing fully well there was no crew. Instead of letting everyone know what was going on so that people could make alternate travel plans or even go home to get sleep to get on another flight in the morning they decided to just lie. And as the crew was getting off the plane the flight attendant has a smirk on her face and the pilot answers a passenger telling her they knew they had timed out. We lost our rental car and non refundable tickets we had to events in NY. Fast forward to the next morning with the next flight they put us on after getting 4 hours of sleep, we're told our plane has arrived but the captain hasn't given the all clear to board. After delaying it 3 times the captain says they hit a bird on the descent into Tampa and need everything inspected. We received an email at 6am and 7am saying our flight was delayed. So please tell me how at 6 in the morning they knew there would be a delay when the plane that 'hit a bird' just landed at 8:30 and needed to be checked then? Long story short we never made our flight and left the airport after waiting a total of 10 hours there and a loss of over $1000. And what do we get from jetblue? A $100 voucher. hey do not care about their customers at all, period. Will never fly them again.",-1

We flew roundtrip Boston to Jacksonville to vacation on the Gulf of Mexico, and were there for Hurricane Michael (Cat 5). Due to the destruction of the area, we decided to pack our bags and return home early, so I called Jetblue to reschedule our flight home and talked with a nice staff member. Because of the hurricane, Jetblue didn't charge change fees or the fare increase, they just swapped our tickets to a different day for no charge. Wow, thank you Jetblue! I normally try to fly Jetblue in the US because they have more legroom, and otherwise seem better than all the other US carriers. Also, on the rare occasion that I have to call to change a reservation I haven't waited long and get friendly people to handle it. So now I have another reason to like this airline.",1

My last experience with this airline was disastrous. I was supposed to fly at 3:45 am and the airline did not stop delaying the flight until it was almost 7 o'clock in the morning when we finally flew, not caring about anything at all, and without giving a real information of what was happening. I personally chose that time to fly because I should be at my job early, and end up losing more than half of the day. And if that were not enough, when we were waiting for flight Nobody was concerned about accommodating their customers in the way that was possible, we spent more than 3 hours without eating, going cold and unable to sleep. But the worst of all is that nobody received an apology for that unforgettable night. I am going to make sure that everyone who travels constantly knows about this event so that they do not go through the same thing that I unfortunately had to go through.",-1

I try to not use this airline when possible due to the rude staff, but this flight was the worst. I was in the bathroom when the attendants decided to serve drinks and they would not let me pass to my seat. I had to stand in the back of the plane the entire time they were serving; approx 30 min.

Sometimes situations are beyond their control. Late staff, weather, lack of disclosure due to uncertainty, etc. Experienced it all. However, what really bothers me I forgot something on the plane on the flight from San Francisco to Boston, realized it as I exited the plane. Have told the staff right away, made a formal claim at the airport within half hour. I haven't retrieved the item yet. 3 weeks later. You leave anything behind and it's gone, no way another passenger would have found it in the deep pocket. They couldn't care less. Employees go first I guess. No work ethic whatsoever.

I can't begin to express my anger and aggravation for JetBlue. First, the seats on the flight were horrible. My lower back was flaring up after the 3 hr flight from BOS to FLL. But the worst part of this all, they lost my luggage. I don't have the ""normal"" black or red luggage. No, this was a bright yellow duffel dry-bag. One would think that with today's technology of bar code scanning that they would have been able to locate my luggage immediately. Not only do they lose it, their poor customer service made the process much worse. After a week, they handed my case to a ""specialist"" and he basically did nothing. Couldn't even return my voicemails when I asked that he call me back. I'm disgusted with this airline.",-1

We were flying internationally and our return flight to RDU from JFK was cancelled unexpectedly by JetBlue with no notification. We rescheduled our flight immediately with Jetblue as we were boarding our international flight and would not have access to phones in order to ensure we were not abandoned at JFK. JetBlue then refused to reschedule our flight closer to our original book time. We also originally paid for a direct flight and we were placed on a layover flight away from our destination. They offered no compensation. Worst airline. Will never fly again. I am strongly encouraging all I know to choose any other airline available. Customer service was awful.,-1

I am six months pregnant and had a medical emergency which led to me bleeding all over the floor in front of a few staff members. The staff at JetBlue immediately took action to help the situation. They could tell that we were in shock and embarrassed. Not only did they get us a wheelchair and called for an ambulance but also called to have the mess cleaned up right away. The staff took our bags, stored them and had them delivered to the hospital. Also booked us on a flight when I was discharged from the hospital all free of charge! Upon our arrival to the gate we were met with flowers, a card signed by the staff and a teddy bear for the baby! This was so unexpected and we are truly touched by the kindness and generosity of the Jet Blue staff!! I wish I knew all of their names however we are so full of gratitude for the above and beyond customer service & care we were shown.",1

To say that my experience with JetBlue was horrible would be an understatement. My flight to Orlando was scheduled to take off at 9:08pm Friday night. After sitting in the airport for over and hour with no information, we found out our flight would be delayed until 1:15am. This is where things went downhill fast. After a significant lack of communication from the staff, our flight was delayed and pushed back another four times making false promises that the flight was on its way. We had asked question after question with little to no response and less than helpful information. After waiting for almost 8 hours in the airport, seeing plane after plane from other airlines leave the airport, we are told that our plane is still in Baltimore (completely irreverent to its route) and would not be arrriving in Newark due to the pilot being “timed out”. They of course got our hopes up once more by telling us they would be getting a substitute plane and crew to take us to Orlando. After waiting ANOTHER hour. They cancelled the flight and left the entire waiting area in a panic. When searching for an alternate flight, not only were they few and far between, but JetBlue had serged all their prices for remaining flights and I paid almost $2,500 one way for four tickets with a layover in a Fort Meyers as my only option to get us to our vacation in enough time to actually enjoy it. JetBlue should be ashamed of these events and the way they conduct business. I will never fly this airline again.",-1

A horrific display of incompetence by one of the ground staff as they backed into the plane breaking their bumper of the towing vehicle and delayed our flight that put it behind a long list of other delayed flights. I am typing this, having been delayed for several hours as we sit on the tarmac. The staff is rude and on edge. They don't want to answer any questions by the customers in the plane. The staff doesn't seem to know what they are doing and have made a mildly annoying experience into a truly terrible one. We will not be flying with Jet Blue ever again.",-1

This is the second time I flew with JetBlue in less than a month and both of them I had to change plans due to inconsistency on their times. I either missed the next flight connection or departure way too late to ruined plans. Jet Blue is economical but it gives me a sense that they overbook more than other airlines creating more stress on their passengers due to the lack availability.,-1
2018-08-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Jacksonville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,First and last experience,True,"  New York to Jacksonville. First and last experience with this airline. Thinking back...I should have clued in to what might lay ahead with this airline since we departed JAX for JFK on another airline and I had noticed then that several of the JetBlue flights had been canceled that were leaving around the same time as ours and our Delta flight departed as scheduled. We had booked JetBlue for our return flight and had arrived on an international flight so had 7 hr layover. Another clue that I should have picked up on, the enormous customer service line located at the JetBlue gate area and the number of people that were crying. After waiting 5 hrs for our scheduled flight we were advised 2 hrs prior to departure that our flight was canceled. Waited in line 1.5 hrs for the agent to tell us they had no available flights for our family of 5 to to get out of New York until 3 days later - no compensation for accommodations - there were cots in baggage claim to sleep on and, in addition, this airline does not work with other airlines to look for other travel availability - only what is available in the JetBlue system. We are a family that travels frequently and realize there can always be issues with travel due to weather and other related issues; however, this airline has no alternative options to get you where you need to go in a reasonable timeframe other than what is in their airline inventory. We had an extra day to allow for issues which would normally be sufficient for any of the other airlines we have flown. We ended up Ubering to Philadelphia to rent a car and make a 17 hr drive to our destination all on our dime which cost about $300 more than the airline tickets for all 5 of us. Oh, but they did offer us a refund - how generous! No, we will not ever book with JetBlue again if the choice is ours and I will tell everyone I know about our experience to warn them about this airline. Bottom line, if it’s important for you to actually get to your destination as you booked it and you don’t have some major flexibility with your plans, this is not a bargain in the least.",-1

Our flight on the way to Cancun was delayed due to “a flight attendant not making it on time” and our flight going back to JFK is delayed every 30 mins to another hour later. Our originally scheduled flight that was leaving at 12:30 became 1:30 then 2:10 then 3:10 then 3:44 and so on and so forth until we arrived at the 6:30 pm time. Instead of being honest about the delay from the very beginning, jetblue continued to send those emails leaving me at the airport for over 7-8 hours and my puppy at home alone without any secondary options. When I called for Help, it was not the service level you could’ve expected. I hung up the phone unsatisfied and even more disappointed than before. With every employee giving me a different answer such as “JFK has shut down all incoming and outgoing flights” - not true as there was another Jetblue flight that came in to “the flight is in the air and will arrive soon”- also not true as the flight hasn’t even left off yet. We have waited 8 hours so far and are expected to wait another 6-7 hours. Jetblue just continuously lie and lie and lie.

After canceling our first direct flight and changing it to a flight the next day with a layover (with my two little ones), to a return flight that was delayed 6 hours for maintenance issues (the man at the counter said he recommend trying to change our flight because something is ""very very wrong with the plane). They put us on a new flight where they tried to seat my three year old by herself and said we could only sit together if we paid an upgrade charge of $40 per ticket. Only after speaking with a supervisor did they refund that money. After all of this,they lost one of our bags and left the rest of our bags in a rainstorm. Everything is soaking wet and anything electronic ruined. Last night they told us they had our missing bag, but now they say they haven't found it at all and can't do anything to compensate for what's inside (owlette monitor, summer baby monitor, etc). I find the customer service unacceptable and do not recommend flying with them especially if you have young children and value your things you entrust to them.",-1
2018-08-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Boston,5.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,stay away from Jetblue,True,"  Nashville to Boston. I would recommend staying away from Jetblue. I really don't think they know what they are doing. I flew with them in January 2018 for the first time as Travelocity gave me this airline option. I was stuck at the FLL airport for an over 6 hour delay. The staff kept giving different reasons as to why the plane was late, they offered junk food as a consolation, and ultimately, it was chaos and very anxiety-provoking. Now, I know they travel a lot to the east coast and it was January, which would likely cause some flight delays. So, I figured I could be fair and give them another try later on as they did give me a $100 flight credit, per their bill of rights. I was very anxious about it, so for about a month before my flight, I checked my flight every single night that I'd be flying on to see if there were major delays again. I needed to be mentally prepared and if it looked rough, I was just going to pay for something else. Well, other than most Saturdays and one Friday, the flight from Nashville to Boston (7:37 PM departure time) was delayed. However, it was at most about a three hour delay, at best 30 minutes.  I was mentally prepared, though, and ready for my likely at worst 3 hour delay. I mean, I live in Nashville, so no biggied if I am delayed out of my own city but what a surprise when I get a text that my 7:37 PM flight was delayed until 12:54 AM! We didn't leave Nashville until 2:19 AM! I got into Boston at 6:30 AM and I should have been there at 11:00 PM the night prior. So, my Saturday was very rough considering I only had 2 hours of airplane sleep. When I had talked with customer service during the delay fiasco, they were of no help. One rep literally told me ""good luck"" and hung up. Also, I am glad I didn't try to get on the flight that next morning from Nashville to Boston because it was cancelled. I felt so lucky that I didn't trust Jetblue enough to book them for my flight home. I flew Southwest home and of course, no problems, per usual. So, I'd stay away from Jetblue. I gave them a second chance and it was basically the same situation as the first time I flew with them. I learned my lesson. I will pay more for dependability, no doubt about that.",-1

Seats are broken down and won’t lean back on either trip. Cabin pressure is horrible so be ready to be tortured as you descend. Crew doesn’t understand customer service and seems to hate their job. No first class seating just their extended seat but what’s the point when it’s all old nasty seats. Never will fly again; best to just fly on a larger airline name.,-1

JetBlue is the worst. Pay the extra money and fly with a reliable air service. Booked a flight Aug 3rd 2018 from Philadelphia to San Juan PR with 1 stop in Boston. 2 hrs prior to boarding received a text message flight was delayed - every few minutes there after kept getting delayed messages until finally they cancelled the flight minutes before we were supposed to board. No explanation only compensation was rebooking for the 5th which made no sense since I was due to return on the 7th. Terrible customer service too. Employees at stand laughing and clowning around. I requested a full refund and instead the employee rebooked me without my consent - spent 30 more mins on the phone to get refund. My entire trip ruined. Do not waste your time. This is a common trend for JetBlue to cancel flights. Terrible service. Pay a little more to fly with reliable air service. Don't take the chance . I lost my chance to surprise my kids who are in PR on vacation. Very sad, was devastated.",-1

On August 2nd 2018 we had the worse experience with Jetblue. Sitting in the airport we got an email, not even a phone call that flight was cancelled. The Jetblue staff couldn't get the computer to over ride the new reservations they were trying to make. Finally got re-booked through Tampa and then Silver Air to Fort Lauderdale. As I was boarding I was told I had a seat change due to a child flying by themselves. No prior warning at all by the Jetblue crew. I was separated from my party. The Silver Air flight was also delayed and a propeller plane that seats 36 people. Not what we paid for. Jetblue response was a $25 goodwill credit. That is more of an insult to me. There are way better choices then this airline. They used to be great. Also stay away from Newark Airport constant delays.",-1

No travel voucher or compensation of any kind was offered. We were told that there may have been pizza ordered for the flight. Once you account for the additional hours waiting for the flight the flight wasn't worth the fare at all.",-1

2018-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nassau to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,will never use them again,False,  Nassau to Fort Lauderdale. Worst airline I’ve ever used. They canceled the flight while we were waiting at the gate and basically told everyone good luck. There were no other flights for 4 days so my kids first vacation in 3 years was canceled. Then I had to wait hours to get my bags back so I could leave. The staff were apologetic and it seemed like they were used to taking abuse for canceled flights but there wasn’t anything they could do to help anyone. I’ve flown other airlines that have had to cancel flights but they all either sent another plane or send larger planes for the next flight to get the people where they needed to be. JetBlue didn’t try to do anything to get anyone anywhere. I will never use them again I’d rather not travel if they are my only option. If they are the only option you won’t be traveling anyway.,-1

Never will fly again was supposed to land in Newark plane magically gets cancelled due to weather that is a complete lie there was no weather issue. Found out from a JetBlue employee that it was mechanical issues, they put us on another flight going to JFK  50 miles out of the way to get delayed another 4 hours due to weather issues that didn’t exist. JetBlue sucks, don’t use them, they always have weather issues when everything is perfectly fine they are the only airline with weather issues.",-1

My husband and I were on our honeymoon in DR, when it came time to fly home, our shuttle at the resort was late and we got to the airport an hour before our departure time. We got to the check in line, staff were so rude, I was disgusted by it. The staff treated us like dirt, and on top of that they closed the gate on us and didn’t let us get our flight. We had to wait 8 hours for the next flight. Horrible way to end our honeymoon. My husband and I will never fly with JetBlue Airways ever again.",-1
2018-07-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Sarasota,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,Complete chaos,True,"  
New York to Sarasota. After travelling 30+ hours from Nepal on Qatar Airways with my two kids, I had a connecting flight on Jetblue to Tampa. What should have been a 3 hrs. fight, turned into a 5 days ordeal. We were on the Initial flight on the 22nd of July which left the gate and then after being in the tarmac for 3 hrs, they returned us back to the terminal because the delay caused one of the crew to be above legal flying time allowed. Our initial flight was eventually cancelled at around 2:00 AM the next day and they gave no compensation citing the cancellation was because of weather. I had to be in the line for more than an hour to book our flights for the next day. I was told we were booked for the next day flight, but when we reached the gate the next day, they told us we didn't have any confirmed seats in any of the JetBlue flights. Same thing happened for a couple of days. Finally, after 4 days, they gave me an option to fly out to Sarasota. In between, they told me they had misplaced my luggage and was asked for me to find out where my luggage was. So, after 5 days, without any luggage, they put me in a flight to a different destination and to top it off, they put us in completely different areas of the aircraft and while I was trying to console my 7-year-old to go sit with a stranger, the flight attendant asks us to take our seat promptly. Please do not fly JetBlue, because they have zero passenger concern, they seriously need to fire the guy who manages the flights and reorganize. They were completely disorganized, desk and the person on the phone telling me I had confirmed flights, while the gate told me I didn't have any. Baggage getting lost and they had no clue where it was last scanned, rude desk people. Complete chaos.",-1

I have lost days of vacation, lots of money and my time. The last reason that my connecting flight was canceled is because of maintenance issues. I have purchased around 10 tickets this month, July 2018 for my father and I combined and the only compensation Jetblue Airways gives you is a one time $100 credit you can only use towards another same airline purchase. It’s unbelievable. Never had such a horrible experience.",-1
2018-07-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Jacksonville,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,canceled last minute,False,  Flight got canceled last minute due to weather even though it was clear skies in New York and Jacksonville. Was told I would have to wait two days for another flight and when I complained got a flight out the next day with a four hour layover in Boston only to find out that the first plane has been delayed indefinitely. Customer service is nonexistent and they have no desire to get anyone out of the airport anytime soon. The car rental hey K budget has raised rates on their rental cars the hotels have raise their rates both because they know flights have been canceled and there’s nothing that the customer can do about it.,-1
2018-07-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Boston,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1,experience was a nightmare,True,"  We got an email that our flight from Houston to Boston on 7/17/18 was cancelled just 10hr before our departure. I have an interview next day in Boston and it was too late to change or cancel accommodations and car rental. I was told by JetBlue representative that my only options were to wait until the next flight which was 2 days away, or just get a refund of the cost of my flight. She refused to help me find another flight on another carrier. To keep my interview I have to book our new flight from different airline which can take me to Boston next day and it cost us extra $253/each ticket more. It was horrible and made us crazy to find a last minute flight that didn’t cost $2000. We arrive in Boston at 3pm early morning and JetBlue refuse to refund us extra cost for our new flight. It was so disappointed. We took JetBlue back home on 7/20/18. Got 3 times email delay notification. This was our first time with JetBlue, our overall experience was a nightmare. We will never take JetBlue in the future again.",-1

The best experience ever traveling the first time with my son. For some reasons our seats were not all in one row with my husband, my son, and I. My son was very upset that they separate us and the flight attendants went above and beyond, and they reassure us that the plane was not going to start flying until we all were seated together. They were so wonderful with my son and I could not thank them enough! Thank you for the best experience ever and for made us as a family feel valuable. Thank you for accommodating us.",1

Most unhelpful staff you could imagine, they could not care less about what your flight plans are and how they can help you. My flight was originally at 5AM to Boston then I had a connecting flight to Bar Harbor Maine at 11. My flight to Boston was delayed 5 times and then we had to move to a whole different gate with no explanation. After being delayed so many times, I missed my connecting flight, not one employee tried or acted like they wanted to help me find a new flight. After I found a flight every attendant refused to print out a boarding pass for me even though they could. I would never take this airline again. Awful costumer service and miserable traveling experience.",-1

Great on-phone customer service but horrible in-person service members. JetBlue cancelled a flight I had booked and placed me on a red-eye the next morning, only for the flight to be delayed by 3 hours. When I complained to a customer service representative, she cancelled my flight for that day and again I missed my flight and had to re-book a flight for a later time in the day. They offered me no vouchers and showed no empathy. Worst customer service. Very unprofessional. Will never fly JetBlue again.",-1

Booked a one way flight from Richmond to Tampa. The first flight was delayed for 2hrs, the second flight had already taken off by the time I arrived to the next airport. So I had to book another flight for Tampa which caused me to wait at the airport another 12hrs. As I was getting ready to board the second flight I found out it was cancelled so I had to book another flight for Orlando instead of Tampa which caused me to wait another 5 hrs because there was nothing available. All off these cancellations and delays caused me to miss out on my daughters birthday which is very unacceptable. This my first time flying with JetBlue and has been the worst experience ever!",-1
2018-07-17,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Los Angeles,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4,understand deficiencies better,False,"  I am reviewing two flights, the first from LAX to JFK. I really like that the airline treats adults as adults and not like children, they have a more hands off attitude, non hovering. The system is quite efficient and flows well. There don't appear to be any meals on board which became a problem on our return from JFK to LAX. The plane was boarded 3 hours late, each update was another 15 minute delay making it impossible to get some food before boarding. We ate a small breakfast thinking we could easily get to our destination as scheduled and eat an early dinner once in LA. The delay made the on flight snacks barely adequate and we were starving once we arrived. There are no healthy snacks, the only offerings are potato chip type bags with carbohydrate and fat loaded ingredients. I guess that's ok if your 20 years old but for many it is undesirable,unhealthy and inadequate. When my wifes Southwest flight was delayed two hours she received a $100 voucher, so far we have seen nothing from Jet Blue and that's okay, we understand delays occur but they need to have contingency preparations in place. There are many things to like about Jet Blue, the seats are very comfortable, the legroom is good, the entertainment screens are excellent. This is an airline that wants to excel, and I think it does, perhaps the decision makers need to take a flight and experience what the traveler experiences and they would understand any deficiencies better. One last thing, the cabin temperature was very cold, I am 63 and needed a jacket, often times I think my age makes me less tolerant of cold but the 30 year old lady sitting next to me had the blanket on and couldn't cover up enough, she was also quite uncomfortable.",1
2018-07-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to New York,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,extreme inconvenienc,False,"  This will be my first JetBlue experience and it will be my last. My flight was supposed to leave at 10am this morning- it’s after midnight and I’m still at the airport. After a twice delayed flight that eventually was canceled I was booked on a flight scheduled to leave at 7:48pm. About an hour before the flight it was delayed for 2 hours. Once we received that delay there have been 5 more, now we’re supposed to leave at 2am. The crew here can’t give us clear answers, one minute it’s going to be earlier than they think the next we get another alert of a delay. Multiple other airlines have taken off from CLT to JFK, I’ve even seen a plane return from JFK that took off from CLT while I’ve been waiting. Ultimately I’d like clear, honest answers rather than deliveries of false hope. Also some kind of compensation for the extreme inconvenience would be nice- but so far it’s just been a bottle of water - disappointed to say the least.",-1

Gate agents in LAX are extremely rude. JetBlue must have many complaints because they refuse to let customers speak with a supervisor. All communication is done through the dearjetblue site. It’s a useless back and forth where nothing gets accomplished. Furthermore, their small credit vouchers are for future use on the airline. Once again, useless for customers who no longer wish to fly JetBlue. There are other options for paying customers. Next time, I’ll take my business to another airline, especially one that has more destinations and more tactful employees.",-1
2018-07-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Aruba to Boston,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,has become a horrible airline,True,  JetBlue has become a horrible airline to fly with. On this four and a half flight there were several issues. I upgraded to more space seats for $170 because the airline strategically blocks off many of the seats so that you cannot sit with your spouse. There was no entertainment on this flight. The wifi did not work either. Apparently their entire systems were down according to the announcement. They would give you a $15 voucher IF you booked through them but would have to jump through hoops because the booking was done through Expedia. As soon as we took off the staff made an announcement that there were no sandwiches or salads available on this flight for sale. Thanks for letting us know after boarding. The plane itself was old and dirty. The seat was hard as a wood plank due to the foam material degrading. Also the cabin was freezing cold and had to spend $5 per blanket to keep warm because they would not increase cabin temperature. Worse flight I've taken in a while and that's saying something since I rarely complain.,-1

Jetblue cancel our flight today from Orlando to San Juan July 9, 2018 party of 6 with a Minor. They book another flight from Orlando to Ponce which is an hour and half drive they told us when we arrived to go to baggage claim in Ponce and they will give us transportation to San Juan for free. Once we arrived to Ponce at 12:30am Jetblue says that they didnt received no emails from Orlando and it was our problem we also waited 9 hours for our flight in Orlando. The supervisor in Jetblue Ponce was very rude. She didn't wanted to help us knowing that we were with a minor.

2018-07-10,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Westchester to Tampa,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4,problematic to say the least,False,"  While my trip was for the most part satisfactory, the return trip from Tampa to Westchester was problematic to say the least. I dealt with not only an extremely rude flight crew, but the crew onboard the aircraft did little to keep the passengers updated with the status of our delay. Due to a ""cracked taxi light,"" the flight was delayed and the flight crew notified us twice, the first notification came when we were initially told about the need for repairs and a ""tape up"", and the second came over an hour later when we were told that ""we would be getting on our way shortly."" The trip down to Tampa from New York was more than satisfactory, but that return trip was problematic from the very start. I shared the sentiment of a frequent flyer one row behind me, who was very vocal about her disappointment with the airline and their handling of the delay. Despite these things, there was a very nice selection for entertainment which included free in-flight TV service and WiFi (which came as a shock to me). Overall it was not an amazing experience and I would recommend this airline, but it would be a matter of comparison. If I had to recommend an airline to someone where JetBlue was one of many options, I would opt for the other options.",1

But after my flight from Denver to Boston and back found staff and flight attendants very attentive to my family's needs, can get all the snacks we needed for the flight, very friendly, very helpful.

2018-07-01,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Boston,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,airline is really declining,True,"  Never Again! I travel from NJ to Boston several times a year to visit family. Since I have 2 small children, ages 4 and 7, sometimes I fly because it is generally quick and easy. The Newark to Boston flight was slightly delayed and my tv did not work but was otherwise uneventful. The trip home from Boston to Newark was a nightmare. My family lives over an hour from the airport and on the drive I got a text from the airline stating the flight will be delayed an hour. We were having some bad weather so that was understandable. I just had to try to entertain my kids for a bit longer in the airport. We boarded the flight at the delayed time and sat on the aircraft for over half an hour just to be told by the pilot they did not get clearance from Newark and ""it may be another hour"" for take off. They let us deplane. After dragging my kids further around he airport to get snacks and games,I noticed that every single JetBlue flight in the terminal was extremely delayed. We returned to the gate to see a big cancelled on the flight board. No announcement made. We were then told to go to customer service to see about getting another flight. After sitting in an airport for hours, I now had to drag my kids to another spot to wait in a very long line. At the desk, the rep told me the flight was canceled because the delays caused the crew to ""time out"". Basically they up and left stranding a whole plane of people with nowhere to go. The rep offered me options on another flight which would land at a NY airport over 2 hours from my home or an 8 pm flight that she told me would most likely be delayed. Neither were reasonable options for my situation. I chose to take a flight at noon the next day since my kids were at their limits of patience. I asked for compensation since I would have to get a hotel for the night and was told no it was not their fault since they canceled for ""weather"". (Seems to me like the crew abandoning ship was why they canceled). Meanwhile other airlines were flying no problem. Now I had to drag my 2 exhausted kids through the airport to reclaim my bags and hope to secure accommodation for the night. I was told that most of the hotels at the airport were booked but the reservation agent at Logan found me a hotel 10 miles outside of the city. We had to wait for a shuttle during rush hour in the rain. A 15 minute ride turned into 40 minutes. What should have been a quick easy 45 minute flight turned into a 24 hour nightmare. It was needlessly stressful and exhausting.I felt like I was left stranded with 2 small kids. It had been a couple of years since I flew JetBlue and I used to love them. Not anymore. From the other reviews I read it seems like my experience is not uncommon. I will pay extra to use United next time, or Amtrak. I will not be using JetBlue anymore. This airline is really declining.",-1

Getting there was ok although I didn’t get the chance to pick my seats so we had to ask people to move since we traveled with children. They cancelled my flight home which was totally inconvenient. We were then booked for the next day and couldn’t stay an extra day so they rebooked us but to fly out of another airport and had less than 3 hours to get ready to go since the time also changes. So we raced to pack say goodbye and leave. We didn’t have any time to put gas in our rental car and had to just drop it off and pay the outrageous fee for gas. Finally got to the new airport and again had to ask people to move so we could sit with our children. Was very stressful.,-1
2018-06-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3,experience is horrible,True,"  Newark to Orlando. The experience is horrible. At the check in they had no vacant seats together so they didn’t assign me a seat, saying they will do that at the gate. At the gate they gave us seats 7B, 19D and 24D!! That meant My 5 years old child was seating alone 5 rows behind me. The Jet Blue personnel is absolutely unprofessional, they didn’t even apologize, and just blamed us by saying that we supposed to come earlier. The whole situation is ridiculous! Jet Blue’s decision was: to put us on another flight or fly as it is! We asked a few people to change their seats but they refused the suggestion. When I buckled up My child he couldn’t understand what is going on and of course started to cry. He didn’t want to be separated or to sit with someone he didn’t know, even though the couple next to him was very sweet. I was too stressed to deal with this and tried to talk to him about it. One of the passengers started to go around and ask people and finally she managed to put us together. I am so thankful to that woman. She said ‘I am a mother of five and we’ll make everything it takes for this guy to be with his mom’. The worst airlines ruined my day but a lovely people pulled it all together.",-1

2018-06-25,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sacramento to New York JFK,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,3,Extremely disappointed,True,"  Extremely disappointed. I've actually been recommending Jetblue Airways even though it has the lowest rating. We had a weather delay which is understandable. We deplaned at the 3 hour mark. We sat at the gate an additional hour and half waiting for further instruction when we were told the flight was cancelled, to get our bags and call the 1-800 number for further assistance. The crew walked off saying they were off duty. The 800 number representatives refer you back to the airport staff which now we can't speak with as we were no longer in the security area. The retrieving of bags was a total mess, it took at least 2 hours for our bags to get pulled off due to so many cancellations. Now I have to wait 2 days to get a flight out not even comparable to the original booking. Isn't a whole plane full of cancelled people enough to add the additional flight that's already been paid for? The worst thing is Delta flew in the same weather, they never deplaned and actually got off the ground and to their destination. I was also told ""the system world automatically rebook my flight"". When I enquired about this process there was no clear understanding by the representative as to how this even happens. At this point.",-1
2018-06-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to PIT,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,could not care less,True," We were done in Boston and went to the airport. We had boarding passes for 10 pm flight. Most airlines let you fly standby same day as it gives them more opportunities to sell higher tickets later. Checkin manager could not care less. $150 to fly earlier. We went to the gate and none of their employees would help. 4 planes left with empty seats. Is that good customer service? Why advertise and send us ""specials"" every Tuesday if that is how you treat good customers? We can talk about the nonworking direct tv, or joke website which does not save info, kicks you off and has not improved in 15 years with the internet or flight delays when it is convenient for you, but you rudely treat good customers and train employees not to use common sense. Just booked our Sept flight to Boston on Delta.",-1
2018-06-21,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to New York JFK,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2,catering couldn't make it,True,"  Portland to New York JFK. Pros: Lots of free snacks such as: pop chips, sweet potato chips, cheeze its, and choc chip cookies. In flight wifi that includes free messaging. In flight TV channels. Cons: Very limited number of airports they fly in and out of within the US. Their planes have an outdated interior, like really outdated. TV screens on the back of seats that are super pixelated and are no bigger than 5'x5' squares. This is your only means of watching the inflight TV channels and movies. The movies have to be started at the beginning of your flight, they start on their own channel and can't be paused. They charge $80+ for the exit row. I personally had a not great experience on my flight home when our six hour flight was delayed due to ""catering"" only to then be told that catering couldn't make it to our plane so they just left without the food for the flight. I also ended up in a seat with a broken headphone jack that only emitted a high pitched squeal so I couldn't watch the tv. The TV tray at my seat was also broken, causing anything on it to slide into the aisle. I reported all these things to JetBlue, only to be told that my trouble was worth a $15 refund. I paid $650 roundtrip.",-1
2018-06-20,1.0,Couple Leisure,Business Class,New York to Las Vegas,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,definitely fly jetblue mint again,True, Excellent flight with jetblue Mint business class. Our bags were taken to get checked in by a lovely jetblue mint team member. We got expedited security clearance too. We boarded on time and got seated. Our flight attendants came round and introduced themselves and asked if this was our first time flying mint. Our amenity kits and a little note were left on the seat. They came round with noise cancelling headphones for everyone. They asked if we would like a drink and myself and my husband chose the refresh mint cocktail. They came round and cleared cups before we took off. Bottles of water provided at every seat in advance. Seat was super comfortable I loved the fact the offer directTV entertainment this was great. The inflight wifi worked perfect and I could stream facebook live. The food again was lovely we ordered the plane eats menu and everything was tasty. The only slight gripe was that the croutons on the salad were soggy. But that's all I could say. Excellent selection of alcoholic drinks. Ice cream for pudding and I chose a lovely freshly brewed coffee. A decent choice of wines with our meal. I settled down as we flew at night and got around 3 hours sleep. It was lovely. The duvet pillow and seat were all comfortable. Cabin and toilets all clean. They left us a milkbar cookie to take home. I would definitely fly jetblue mint again.,1
2018-06-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Cancun,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,had a bad experience,False,"  Me and my wife had a bad experience with Jetblue's staff on a flight to Cancun from Ft Lauderdale. Our 21 month old toddler was crying a lot with no clear reasons why. My wife and I were trying our best to calm her down. The air hostess comes over and says that we need to calm her down because we were disturbing other passengers! Of course we don't want our baby to be crying and do NOT want her to be distressed. We were trying our best to soothe her down but nothing was helping. This was totally unexpected. When the airline was contacted, they did apologize, but at the same time, they reiterated that the air hostess did not do anything wrong. So basically, Jetblue is a non infant/toddler friendly airline for sure. And they support their staff when they do anything wrong.",-1

It was 2 hours delayed due to a weather. On the plane I was dehydrated and taking medication. I ask the staff 2 times to buy a food box for $ 8. He never came back.

Horrible. 6:00 am flight was initially delayed 2 hours just minutes after boarding. Then it was delayed a half hour at a time all day long. Sitting at the airport now - 7 hour delay and still counting. No answers. They gave us snack bags of chips and pretzels at the 5 hour mark for the inconvenience. What a joke.,-1

2018-06-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1,not worth the stress and risk,False,"  Nashville to Fort Lauderdale. I got an email that my flight was cancelled 6 hours before takeoff for 'maintenance issues'. As we were going on vacation, it was too late to change or cancel accommodations and car rental. I was told by two supervisors that my only options were to wait until the next flight which was 2 days away, make a 4.5 hr drive to Atlanta for a flight tomorrow, or just get a refund of the cost of my flight. They refused to help me find another flight on another carrier. As we already had several thousand dollars invested in this vacation, I had no choice but to do all the legwork and somehow manage to find a last minute flight that didn't cost $2,000. I did get one (thank goodness), that had multiple stops, was 3 hours longer and didn't get in until after midnight. I called Jetblue back to have them refund my flight and see if they could refund me the extra $269.00 it cost for my new flight. They refused and said they would only refund the cost of the flight and give a $100 flight voucher for my 'inconvenience'. Beware of Jetblue when there are problems, if you've read anything on this page you should see that they are ill prepared for issues or to compensate customers for what could be severe financial burdens. I felt like neither supervisor I spoke with was willing to go even a little above and beyond to help me out. I declined the vouchers and told them I would never fly JetBlue again - it's not worth the stress and the risk.",-1

Standard reclining seat, drinks and snacks offered. Felt disappointed that our seats on the way back from our trip didn’t recline. When we asked if we could move into the empty seats behind us after take off, we were told that it would be an upgrade charge. Mind you the plane was a tiny two seater and it was not an upgrade in class or even leg room, we just asked for seats that reclined. They also set the AC to super low and purposely sold blankets. We paid over $300.00 for each of our seats, since when is it an upcharge to recline your chair and be frozen? The flight attendant wasn’t much help either and was dry with his responses.",-1
2018-05-22,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Diego,3.0,,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1,not be flying JetBlue again,True,"  Boston to San Diego. Absolutely horrible experience. My family was placed on a “Mint” flight in economy class (without our knowledge). The flight was delayed upwards of 3 hours because a catering truck for first class passengers had not yet arrived. There was absolutely no reason for the delay other than their shortage of catering for first class passengers. It wasn’t unfair to every other customer on the flight, and it is appalling to me that this seems to be happening all over the country with JetBlue flights. I will not be flying JetBlue again and I certainly hope to be compensated for this outrageous inconvenience.",-1

The flight itself was late, both for departure and landing. We were late more than 10 minutes for departure and landing, but some of this was due to low visibility conditions. Additionally, the employees at the kiosk were very unaware of when the aircraft would be getting in. They also failed to change the flight monitor at the gate to the delayed time. Despite these inconveniences, we did depart and land safely, with very little turbulence. The seating was pretty comfortable, and the in-flight WiFi actually worked, to my surprise. The overall flight was not bad, and I wouldn't mind flying with jetBlue again.",1

My wife has a severe peanut allergy. I always double check to make sure it’s in the system. Our return flight did not have the peanut allergy on my wife’s profile from the first flight. I had them add it and once we went to our gate the person in charge checked the ticket, because we board early to wipe the seats, and he said it wasn’t in their system,  life and death allergies are no joke!",-1

This was my first time traveling JetBlue and it was the worst experience. Firstly, the app would not allow me to check in, the terminal kiosk would not allow me to check it. Therefore, I was forced to stand in line to check in with an agent. Next my flight was delayed due to “maintenance”. I had an extremely close connection at the Ft. Lauderdale airport. The most stressful day of travel. Upon my return flight, again the app and check in kiosk were not available to me. My second flight was delayed three hours again due to maintenance. I met a couple on my trip who also flew Jetblue to our destination and they missed their connecting flight and was forced to spend the night in Ft. Lauderdale due to plane “maintenance”. With all this maintenance that you’re performing you would think the planes would be impeccable. I will spend the extra $200 in the future and fly Delta. I have nothing positive to say about my experience and I will not give them a second chance.",-1

I was really disappointed in the interior of the plane on my recent flight. Before flying, my impression of JetBlue was that the airline had high-quality entertainment and interiors. The plane flying to Quito was really worn out. Whole rows of screens were not working and flickering quickly. My row fortunately worked at first, but then failed about 2 hours into the flight. The attendants seemed to have trouble speaking clearly over the intercom. The plane was also uncomfortably hot. I was impressed by the in-flight service, but the low quality of the plane was deeply disappointing. The JetBlue gate area in FLL is also very overcrowded and low on services. This makes me really weary of taking JetBlue to South America or the Caribbean again.",-1

One member of cabin staff was very lazy, not helpful at all, extremely rude towards crew members and passengers. I asked for tea or coffee and he said there was no more with an attitude meanwhile the other flight attendant got me the coffee with any hesitation and was extremely polite snd helpful. I'm very disappointed with this situation, seeing that I've always had good experiences with Jetblue. Several passengers dealt with the same issue and were all complaining during the flight. It was very unfortunate that the other crew members had to deal with this attitude as well.",1

They don't care to indicate online as to which seats do not tilt back so I picked the wrong seat. Had 1 hour of sleep on the plane and was absolutely spent the next day during classes. I complained to a stewardess and she didn't care less. No place else to complain to with jetblue. I hate these people.,-1

I have not flown jetBlue in a while and just wanted to say that the crew of B6 282 on 3rd May are doing a phenomenal job. Very rarely have I seen such a hospitable and nice crew. I hope  the crew gets at least some recognition for their efforts as it is too often I encounter very unfriendly and unpleasant flight staff. I will be looking to fly jetBlue from now on.,1
2018-04-30,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,so disappointed in Jetblue,True,"  On Sat April 28 I was flying on flight 959 from Bradley international to Fort Lauderdale at what was suppose to be 7:45am. According to the JetBlue staff, the first delay was due to chipped paint at the nose of the aircraft that needed to be fixed. Then an entire hour later they ran into an “over fueling” issue that set us back. The JetBlue staff stated that specific plane was ready for take off to San Juan PR and was not prepared to travel to Fort Lauderdale with that much fuel and had to wait for the fuel service to come and fix the problem. My sister and I had our children with us and had to board the carnival cruise by 3:30pm at the Miami port which is at least 45mins away from Fort Lauderdale with traffic. We did not leave Bradley until about 10:10am. So as you figured we did not make it in time to board our cruise for my sons 8th birthday. We did not receive a dime back and had to return flight back home the next morning. Seeing we are in spring and it was an early enough flight we did not think insurance was necessary. I’m so disappointed in Jetblue and will never pick this airline as first choice.",-1

On the way home we were delayed an hour on the flight from Punta Cana to FL and then our flight from FL to Charleston delayed an hour and a half (no explanation why). Every single flight was delayed. Not like a ten minute delay but an hour or more. Incredibly frustrating. And only one flight attendant we encountered was actually friendly. Will fly any other airline if at all possible.

They put us at the very back of the plane on the way to JFK on our outbound plane. The seats did not recline and they were next to the bathroom. For our return flight we had to change the day and when we did that the airline associate we spoke to said they would not put us in the back on our return flight. Oddly enough, when we arrived in JFK for our return flight we were told we had the seats in the back of the plane, again. The associate at the gate was extremely rude when we said that we were told that we would not get those seats. Bottom line is this airline has no integrity. We’re very disappointed. I will, from here on out, be very opposed to flying this airline.",-1

This was without a doubt, the worst traveling experience I've ever encountered. We sat on the terminal for over two hours, waiting to 'de-ice.' Mind you, I counted over 10 planes come in and take off while we continued to sit there. With the whole flight crew knowing that they had over 85% of the flight needing to be on time with their connecting flights. We were assured that the crew did not know any information and they could do nothing to help us. Once we landed, the captain casually said that we were over two hours late. He never apologized for the horrible landing or terrible timing that had occurred. Then we were advised to go the help desk and we would be assisted there. They had one staff member helping our whole flight. We weren't booked to fly out until the next day, in which we had to fight to get a hotel to stay in for over night. Jet Blue did not care about anyone's time management or money. Every single flight that we had or saw was delayed. It is the worst airline I've ever flown on and will never recommend it to anyone.",-1

I am very disappointed in my recent flying experience with Jet Blue. My boyfriend and I were traveling to Cancun for a getaway, on the way there we had a connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale with a layover time of 43 minutes. We were delayed as the plane needed to be deiced prior to takeoff, which set us back 25 minutes. Our flight was a smooth flight, landing in fort Lauderdale 22 minutes prior to us needing to get on our connecting. However, due to us arriving a bit later than scheduled time we had no gate to run into therefore waited on the runway for 20 minutes, causing us to miss our connecting. We were informed by the pilot that he got confirmation from the pilot that they would hold the doors. The crew allowed us to get off the plane first and race (and mean race) to our gate. Jetblue closed the doors 1 minute prior to us getting to our gate. We ran to the desk however the gentlemen informed us we were too late the doors have already been closed. I informed him the pilot was aware we were minutes late however he said that’s too bad once the doors are closed they are closed. The customer service received at the help desk was ridiculous. The attendant advised us there was nothing they could do other than put us on the next flight which was scheduled for the next day. I told them that was in 24 hours from now and they said we could sleep in the airport. We requested to speak to a manager as we were receiving little help or support. 1 hour later no manager arrived. I phoned JetBlue and advised them of our situation and in turn they offered us a free stay at a nearby hotel. Better than sleeping on a stiff airport chair. I am writing this review so customers/future customers flying with JetBlue can see the hassle my boyfriend and I went through. I am thankful we received a night however if a gate would have been opened we never would have had to spend 3 hours at the airport trying to make alternative arrangements and would have enjoyed the day/night paid for at the all inclusive resort. Not a good way to spend your anniversary! I would also like to add - if you are connecting to another flight using the same airline and you are Within minutes of reaching your gate, the pilots should communicate with each other. Not a good experience with Jet Blue!",-1

As recent as two years ago I would have said it was the best airline in the US. Flew Detroit to Boston. After today, I’d have to put them a grade above Spirit. Inflight entertainment is primitive and outdated. Flight delays seem to be a regular occurrence. No USB ports to charge your devices.

It seems based on rumors in the plane that a passenger with a dog refused to put the dog in their carrier. I went up after 30 minutes asking for communication to the passengers and was ignored. The flight crew kept complaining about the passenger with the dog very unprofessionally and gossiping about other flights. Ground crew was particularly unprofessional.",-1

We have been stuck at the airport now for 6 hours and still no true light in sight. Looking at the Jet Blue screen there are 6 delays. I wish there were more up to date on there delays. We checked before leaving for the airport everything said on time. Seems 20 minutes after dropping off the rental car we get the delay notice, 1 hour, getting updates but been here for six hours now. We could have stayed in the rental and enjoyed the days, instead we are sitting with about 600 customers. The delay is due to a breakdown with the plane. I asked at the other gates that were delayed and all stated there was a concern with the plane.  I guess I have no choice as I am stuck here. Please stay away from airlines they do not care about your time or there delays as it not there time they are wasting. I have only flown JetBlue three times - 2 out of three were horrible.",-1
2018-04-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,I’m extremely disappointed,True,"  JetBlue used to be good and on point but my last 3 experiences were completely unacceptable and I will never be flying with them again. First flight they delayed it 4 times; but it was a morning flight and I still got to my destination; dealt with it 2nd flight traveling to New York, canceled my flight 15 minutes before it was supposed to take off. Put me on a new flight which was delayed 3 times. Got to New York, lost my luggage, delivered it to me 2 days later, completely ruined. Third flight (current situation) convinced all friends to fly with them since I had a credit from the last experience. Flight to Vegas for best friends bachelorette. Had a limo waiting for us upon pick up that was paid for and bought tickets to a show as well. Flight delayed four times now. I called after the first time and the guy said it was due to weather, so I was understanding, you can’t control the weather - delayed the second time and the guy at the counter said it was due to the plane not leaving Havana Cuba yet. Delayed a 3rd time; getting pretty frustrated at this point and call again. They can only say sorry. Doesn’t help me. Then delayed a 4th time. It’s now not supposed to leave until 12:45AM. Our entire night is cancelled and ruined. I looked at the board and it looked like every Jetblue flight was delayed.  I promise they used to be good; but they aren’t anymore. If you want to get to your destination on time, fly with Delta, American, or even Spirit I would say is better now. Less amenities but more reliable. I’m extremely disappointed.",-1

JetBlue boards from the back of the plane, which really sucks because I had seat 3D. Boarding as quick and went okay. Legroom on the E190 is amazing, felt like Premium Economy on a legacy carrier. The IFE was outdated but worked amazing. Many channels and things to choose from.The wifi is free and worked very well. Now to the bad things. There was only 1 flight attendant and he wasn't the best. Service started late and it was done in an unprofessional manner. The website said there would be snackboxes on this flight but he did not have any which was disappointing. He acted uninterested in us and didn't really talk much or act happy. The pilots also did not make any announcements or keep us informed at all. Overall, it didn't meet my expectations but it was decent and I would probably still choose them again for a future flight.",1

I would like to commend our flight attendant for her professionalism, politeness, and perseverance dealing with a man who sat in a “MORE SPACE” seat that was not assigned to him. She explained that he needed to either pay the extra charge for the seat or have to return to his seat. He gave her a very hard time but she was really a rock star with handling him and finally the man paid the extra charge. She treated him no differently than anyone else for the rest of the flight. A job well done.",1

2018-03-30,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Providenciales to Washington via Fort Lauderdale,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2,Jetblue Airways customer review,True," We originally had a 4 hour layover scheduled in Fort Lauderdale. When we arrived the Jetblue folks said we may be able to make the earlier flight, but then quickly said we could not. We went to the gate of the earlier flight and they said it would be a $75 per person change fee. Our flight was already delayed but they would not waive the fee. So, now our flight is delayed 90 minutes and we will now have at least a 5.5 hour lay over because JetBlue would not give us open seats. They said it is policy. The reason I fly Jetblue was because I liked that they were customer friendly - not like American or United. This policy contradicts that belief. I will not be going to Jetblue as a preferred airline anymore. I hope they consider the impacts of their “policy” on the customer experience.",-1

Missing that flight to Houston cost me time, money, and possibly a job. That was poor customer service on their part, and blaming it on weather when the weather was fine in Houston and Dallas was ridiculous. I'm sure it's all about the money as always so I would never recommend this airline to anyone.",-1

Well, actually surprised by the old (18-20 years old said pilot) A320 which was not clean. The tiny seat screens for entertainment flickered in and out on my seat and the one next to me. The service was fine (think AA or Delta) and we arrived on time but, due to other reviews, I was expecting more. I usually fly Delta or AA and I see no reason to change.",-1
2018-03-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Orlando,,,,,,1.0,1,never fly this airline again,True,"  Salt Lake City to Orlando. From 3:49pm to 7:30pm I received multiple emails of flight delays, then corrected to on time, then delayed, then on time, then delayed from 10pm departure to 1am departure. I called the airline to complain that this did not seem as a weather delay even though it was insisted multiple times that it was, but as internal issues, seeing as they knew the plane from NY was delayed to us by 2 hours and we kept receiving multiple changes. You can track a plane on flight aware and know when it will take off and land. I explained my case and the manager states “so you want a refund”. I said I think that is fair seeing as this is clearly not a weather delay because you can track the plane that was supposed to pick us up, and the airline knew since 3:49pm it was not going to make it. She refunded my money but did not say anything about cancelling our tickets. Maybe I am just ignorant, but I thought the airline was refunding my money because they valued their clients.  Thankfully we realized she cancelled our tickets because the App no longer found our reservation. I called back to in fact confirm with a live person a manager cancelled my reservation without telling me, then had to void the refund, was charged again, and received our places back on the flight. Now I am sitting exhausted in the airport, as I write, being told the flight was delayed actually by a mechanical issue. Not by a flight delay from the planes previous destination, as I expected all along. But at least my husband and I have a ticket to board and didnt get to the airport with no reservation because the woman failed to tell me she completely cancelled our flight. That would have been another aggravating battle to deal with. What are we supposed to stay in Salt Lake City for the rest of our lives?!? As far as I’m concerned every passenger should be refunded for the lies this airline has said to their customers. We will never fly this airline again.",-1

Not only that our two flights were delayed by two hours and one hour but also they didn't allow us with a baby 2 months and 3 years to board earlier like preboarding which other airlines allow and also gave us tickets in the last row of the plane.

Even on the short 49 minute hop from Newark to Boston (and at 5.30 am, I might add), the cabin crew and pilots were quite warm, friendly, and very helpful. My carry-on was unable to fit in the overhead bins, so the FA placed my bag in an empty seat so we didn’t have to gate-check it. Early departure and arrival, pilots provided arrival gate info in the air. Snack and drink service was efficient and quick. Cozy leather seats, albeit a bit old. IFE was medicore, but appreciated! I plan on choosing them over United any day on this route. Also mind you, $49 one way ticket booked one week before departure (including seat selection and snacks on board).",1

I flew in on Thursday with economy plus more room seats. On the way back from San Francisco’s to NY, the plane was maybe 30% full and mostly empty. We kindly waited for everyone to board to see if the row in front of us which had a few extra inches of leg room would be vacant (I am 6’3 so those extra inches would make a big difference). When the plane doors closed and we were ready to roll, I kindly asked the flight attendant to let me move one row up considering it was empty, she immediately went on the most uncomfortable rant about extremely strict policies (which isn’t true I fly with JetBlue and virgin airlines only and always had very nice flight crews tell me absolutely no problem as long as no one sits here when the doors are shut, feel free) long story short the flight attendant was so adamant about not letting me move even though the plane was more than half empty and it was so unpleasant considering I love this airline along with virgin airline. I will no longer fly JetBlue for this reason and this is all about principle. Extremely uncomfortable situation to pretend like they can’t move you whatsoever. I will only fly virgin from now on. Customer service skills are terrible.",-1

This was my first time flying with JetBlue. I had read many reviews about delayed flights and other inefficiencies, but I wanted to experience it for myself. My two flights to CTG departed on time with no issues. While returning, my second flight was delayed by hours. The delay was due to the wrong plane being assigned. I explained to the associate my concerns because I would be missing my train and would either have to spend hundreds on a hotel or almost $80 on an Uber. The associate explained that nothing is in her control and that JetBlue would not be able to provide a voucher. Customer service was called and they stated the same thing. I ended having to get a hotel room for almost $200 and purchase another train ticket home. I was told that I could send receipts, but that if JetBlue decided to reimburse it would be with flight miles. I haven't been this disappointed in a company in a while, but I have learned my lesson. I will not be flying with them in the near future.",-1

They ended up having a delay, so I arrive at my overlay later than I should, so I can't catch the original flight from JFK to CHS because I land three minutes after the flight leave.

After 5 minutes of him yelling at me for asking the question he said I better get on the plane now. After turning and going 30 ' down the ramp he came running after me still waiting to yell at me. There was nothing I could do but stand there in shock of what just happened. So I then turned and continued the rest of the way to the plane.

Very disappointed with the service provide by JetBlue. Everything started with the storm Grayson. My flight was on January 4th from Santo Domingo to JFK New York. That day they kept us all day updating the board with the delay flight sign to let us know at the end of the day that the flight was cancelled. I was supposed to stay in The Dominican Republic for 10 days but end up staying for 15 days. Calling my job everyday to keep them updated about the situation that I was going through. At the end I think they didn’t even believe me, because every day I have to explain my boss how Jetblue couldn’t find two seat to accommodate my boyfriend and I. I paid for those five days out of my pocket to stay in a hotel close by the airport because every flight the put my boyfriend and I were cancelled every day for those 5 DAY. My flight was supposed to be a non stop flight because I HATE to do Laid over, but guess what the only flight the had available was with a laid over in ft. Lauderdale. I ended up traveling January 8th at 4:00am from Santo Domingo to ft. Lauderdale. When I was in lauderdale had to wait till 7:00pm to get another plane to Newark not being Newark my flight destination. Because when I bought my flight it was from JFK to Santo Domingo “straight flight” and my returns was supposed to be Santo Domingo to JFK not Newark “straight flight too” I spent almost 24 hours to get a flight which last just 3:45hrs. And the funny thing when I got to ft. Lauderdale I went to one of the JetBlue representatives to asks him that please if there were an earlier flight available because I think is was ridiculous to wait 10 hours in an airport for another flight, but the guys told me in order for him to do that I had to pay 75 dollars for me and 75 dollars for my boyfriend because I was trying to change the reservation that they already gave me. Even thought I explain him that I had an nonstop flight, but because of the situation of the storm they didn’t give me any choice but to accept the laid over. I end up paying almost 2,000 dollars between the hotel, food and transportation from my hotel to the Santo Domingo airport and once I got to Newark I had to take a taxis to JFK parking lot because I left my car parked over there to avoid paying for taxi. But at the end I had to do everything I planes not to do.",-1

When the flight was cancelled due to weather the manager refused to accomodate my serious disability. He wouldn’t accept (or even let me present) my medical document proving my disability and was all around disinterested in the fact that I have this disability. Apparently they cannot make accommodations for someone if a flight is cancelled due to weather even if they are legitimately disabled. I am severely disappointed and disturbed. Even after 2 hours on the phone with corporate they cannot do anything to accommodate my disability, because it was a weather cancellation. Apparently if it was cancelled another way they would have been able to. How is having a documented medical disability not an accepted extenuating circumstance? I am downright flabbergasted at the lack of empathy and customer service. All they can provide me with is a cot, of which I am larger than, without pillows or blankets. Without my suitable accommodations for the disability I will not be sleeping tonight. Thanks for the customer disservice!",-1

Upon arriving to the airport, I got an email that the flight would be delayed 15 minutes. I then received a few more emails that informed me that my flight was delayed by about an hour and a half. I went and got dinner at the airport, where I got one email about the flight arriving a little earlier, 7:54 instead of 8:09. I made plans to leave dinner to get to the gate at 7:20, where I arrived to find out my flight had left. The emails that the flight was no longer delayed came in at 7:12, and I didn’t see them. JetBlue booked me on another flight with no charge, with a layover in New York that will take much longer to get home. It seems to me like emails about delays should not have been sent out if the flight was going to leave on time. I am disappointed that JetBlue delays every flight I have taken with them, but I am more disappointed now that I thought the flights were delayed as always, and ended up missing my flight, even though I arrived at the airport hours before.",-1

But the past few experiences have been awful. Changed their policy in October so you can’t get on any earlier flight no matter what without a $75 change fee, even if the flight is only 60% full and you are standing at the gate - and even if you are a true blue member, frequent flyer, and JetBlue credit card holder (I am all 3, have been for almost 10 years). Instead of going home I will be waiting in Fort Lauderdale airport for 4 hours, where I just watched a half full flight board and take off for the same location (because I won’t pay $75!). Not to mention, the crew were confused (albeit very nice though) and sent me to 4 wrong locations just to inquire about the switch. Used to be a great airline, I am I’ll be cancelling my card and switching to virgin (I fly cross country a lot since I live in San Francisco and have family in Boston).

I booked a flight for my elderly father while he traveled from MA to FL to be with his best friend as he passed. I had called in to see what would happen if my dad either missed the flight, or had to move it up, just to be prepared. The woman on the phone told me there would be a $100 re-booking fee plus the difference in cost of the flight if there was one. She also told me she'd leave a note in my file that this was something I was inquiring about. Unfortunately, my father's best friend passed earlier than expected, and he wanted to get out of there immediately. He asked me to call Jet Blue and book him a ticket for today. I called again, totally willing to pay the fees just to get my father home and out of a sad situation. A woman on the end of the line was an absolute angel. She saw the note in my file and shortly afterwards, my father had a ticket booked home for day, with a seat close to the front, and for much lower than the originally expected cost. She did not have to do this. She made a really tough day a little easier on me and my father. It was very, very sweet, and I feel compelled to write this review out of appreciation.

Not only did they give my window seat up, when I had only missed the boarding time of 6:17 by 8 minutes, but once reassigned to a window seat they asked if I could get up and move one more time. When I purchase a seat, for this amount of money, I expect my seat to be secure. I didn’t appreciate how easy it was for them to ask me to move.

On the day of travel, our flight was delayed due to maintenance problem, but the ground staff did a good job of keeping us updated. When I entered the aircraft, it was unpleasantly warm for several minutes before AC started.

I've traveled all over the world and I have to say my experience on Jetblue was ""excellent."" Since JFK is 70 miles from my home, I generally would not have traveled to this airport to utilize this airline, but it was well worth the trip. (First time on Jetblue) Honestly, I didn't really appreciate paying $50 for arriving at the customer service desk for another flight for arriving 1 hour prior to departure, but it is what it is. On Tuesday, Oct 24, I flew non-stop from JFK to MBJ and the flight crew on Flight 479 was the best I have ever encountered. Staff were courteous, friendly, and top notch individuals. They were very personable and were generally concerned about the customers. The only other flight crew I encounter this nice was EVA Air last year when traveling from Taipei to Beijing. They fed me on an actual meal on a 3 hour flight. I would definitely travel this airline again! My traveling companion felt the same way. We have traveled on at least 15 vacations together.",1

These delays were 10, then 15, then 20, then 30 minute increments. The staff wasn't forthcoming and said we would be boarding sooner than what my text updates were relaying.

They say that if you contact them within a short amount of time you can change your flight with no change fee except you can't get ahold of them. Their system was down. How convenient. Not worth the hassle. I fly to CT all the time and I can go without WIFI for the three hours and stick to an airline I trust like Southwest!",-1

Power went out before even taxiing out. Had to wait without air for a minute when it was already hot onboard. It’s been a while since I’ve flown JetBlue.

Positives: comfortable seats, accommodating flight staff. Negatives: Long flights should require warm meal service, ticket was sold, indicated as having a meal included, instead had to pay over $10 for a terrible, unappetizing, low quality, small portion meal of grey soba noodles and dried out chicken, just awful. No nuts for protein, just salty starches for snacks. Only one pass through for drinks, soda, water etc the entire cross country flight. Worst things for flying: salt and little fluids. Nickle and dime you to death on JetBlue : have to pay for checked bag $25 , pay for blanket, headset for movies etc. Online check in; couldn’t pay for bags thus had to go through line at airport. Flight delayed two hours due to “JFK airport runway issues” . Not worth the dubious savings.",-1

Been sitting here for an hour and a half waiting to for maintenance to check the plane. Barely gave us water and cookies while we wait. We're all just waiting to see what happens. Can't get off the plane. We're all stuck. On top of that, my TV doesn't work. They keep saying they'll reset the TV's but they haven't yet. This truly is the worst flight I've been on. I'll let you know when we leave.",-1

Quick and easy check in at New York JFK, on time boarding and departure. The 'mini suite' seats in Mint class are fantastic. Spacious, comfortable and private. Great entertainment options, free fast wifi, decent food and very good drinks. Excellent cabin crew, friendly and attentive. Flight arrived on time. Sadly my luggage didn't make it, but the ground staff were very helpful and sympathetic. In the end I had to travel to the airport the next day to pick up my bag, which put a damper on an otherwise excellent and great value flight. If my bag had arrived on time i would give them 10/10",1

JetBlue used to be decent, but not any more! Cannot even sit 2 passengers next to each other except on the very last row? Then they claim imaginary JFK airport repairs are causing them to delay a flight by almost 3 hours without sending a prior email to inform us. So we had to wait for 3 extra hours in the airport after checking through security because even though the flight was obviously delayed they still want you at the gate at the original boarding time - how non sensical is this? Any decent airline would inform their customers in advance of a delay but this is too much to ask of JetBlue. Never again.",-1
2017-10-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Charleston,,,,,,1.0,1,first and last experience ,False,"  This is my first and last experience with JetBlue. Today, October 6, 2017, my two sisters and I were booked on a direct flight from Washington to Charleston set to depart at 7:00 am. We arrived at DCA timely as well as checked out bags timely. We stopped to get coffee next door to our gate (Gate 28) and proceeded to our gate more than 15 minutes prior to departure time only to see the gate had already closed and we were not allowed board our flight, yet our luggage is on the flight. There was not a courtesy page, no announcement of flight boarding, no final boarding announcement, nothing. We had to watch our flight take off in front of us. This is a huge inconvenience because this delays our trip by hours because we had to rebook on another flight which gets us to Charleston at 4:56 pm versus our original arrival of 8:40am. Poor customer service at its finest. I wish I would have read these reviews before booking with Jetblue as I see this is quite common. We couldn't even get Customer Service to comp us for the new flights we had to book even after they acknowledged their wrong doing. Never again.",-1

Have had - hands down the worst experience with jetblue ever. First my flight (flight 1186) was delayed 2 hours and my connecting flight ended up leaving as my flight was getting to the gate at 11pm. Jetblue was unable to reroute me until the next morning at 8am. They didn't comp me a hotel room and they refused to comp me anything else whatsoever. Ended up getting a cot, but not sleeping much. Was woken up at 4.30am by a man telling me he was taking my cot. Are you serious? Tried asking for the man's name who flagged down an English speaking employee who called his superior and stated that was the norm, yet provided no sympathy or other assistance. In tears, I went to the justask desk and asked if they could do anything whatsoever. Nope! Not even a ""lunchbox"". I didn't think customer service this bad was possible. Not upset that they couldn't do anything in regards to my flights, it's just that not one person said sorry or even tried to make the situation better.",-1

I have been a loyal Expedia & Jetblue Customer and I will never book another trip via either one of these sites again. My husband and I had booked a trip to go to Montego Bay, Jamaica for our honeymoon, our flight was delayed multiple times without reasoning. Staff members refused to elaborate the cause very cold and unprofessional. Upon calling JetBlue customer service the representative failed to give any reasoning and was very unapologetic. To make matters even worse we had the same experience returning to JFK. I recently canceled a trip booked via Expedia due to a medical occurrence and Jetblue nor Expedia are willing to refund my money, even considering the fact I purchased travel insurance (in the event something beyond my control was to happen, resulting in not being able to travel). After playing unnecessary phone-tag and speaking to many rude, unsympathetic representatives along with their supervisors to no avail no one is willing to assist me. It is absolutely appalling and mostly disturbing to see such a lack of compassion that has failed to be given.",-1

JetBlue is one of the worst airlines I've flown on. I arrived for an 1130 flight at 11:16 AM because TSA took half an hour to check a single bag. When I arrived at the gate and asked to go on the person there told me that they would need to find out if I could still get on the plane. She disappeared and came back once the flight already left. The flight ended up leaving 10 minutes early and they couldn't wait a single minute to let me on it. I went to complain and the supposed ""customer service representative"" didn't care. She wouldn't even look at me when I was talking. When I was finished she tried to argue with me until her coworker said ""It's not worth arguing with him."" Once I did get on a later flight, I was not surprised to find that they nickel and dime you for everything (they even charge you for headphones), seats are uncomfortable and there is no space between them.",-1

Me and my family flew from New York to San Diego and then back a week later. Everything from check in to boarding was smooth and on time. We enjoyed the pleasant staff, the extra leg room, the unlimited snacks and soft drinks, also had alcoholic beverages both ways and never got charged for any. We enjoyed the Direct TV on each seat and the endless list of movies. We checked in a car seat for our son on way abck and we received it wrapped at JFK at no charge. The flight attendant on the return flight remembered us from the inbound flight a week prior, which I thought was pretty cool. Overall a great experience! The only downside for me was the comfort of the seats, I found them a little uncomfortable.",1

However, I got my bag the next day with all my clothing wet and stains and I couldn't wear anything inside the suitcase. I had to pay for two seat so I can be seated with my 8 years old on the flight who is an minor when I did my son ticket I was that when I am doing my ticket all I have to do is give the customer services the confirmation from his ticket and they gone leave the seat next to him open which they did not and I had to pay for us to be seated together coming back home.

I normally find their staff to be pretty friendly and accommodating for the most part, but today was very special. Today we thought we'd try our luck and ask to switch to an earlier flight home and got to the airport about an hour before the next available flight and explained our situation to the attendant. No hesitation whatsoever. Things unfortunately got a little complicated when there was a glitch in their system, but staff remained patient and friendly and even called the gate to make sure it remained open for us. They didn't even charge for the ticket change. To top this off, when we arrived at the gate, the flight attendant who recognized us from our previous flight came up to say hello. He asked us what seats we had and after realizing we were way in the back, he immediately changed our seats to the ""Even More Leg-Room"" seats without us even asking for it. No charge either! He even invited us to board first.  I appreciate these gestures that the JetBlue staff have done for me and my dad in this rather difficult time for us. This review is meant to be a sort of thank you to the amazing staff. I look forward to flying with JetBlue again, as always.",1
2017-09-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Antigua,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,communication is key,False," I understand that there were issues with the route because of the storms in the Caribbean and Florida. However we still landed in Fort Lauderdale and was told we will be there for 20 minutes to refuel and be catered to. That message came from the Captain when we landed. As I type this review, it's past an hour I'm sitting here on the aircraft with other annoyed passengers without a update from the Captain as to what is happening. JetBlue need to realize that communication is key and passengers need to know everything that is going on as long as it's in their interests. How can it be right to be sitting on a airplane without any knowledge of what's going on, time of next departure or even some kind words to comfort the passengers who would have already been at JFK from 7am to catch this flight? It's now 5:17pm and I'm basically being held onboard because I was told no one will be able to disembark. I would like to hear if this is standard procedure for airlines. This is my first flight with JetBlue and I don't think I will be booking another.",-1

Despite the flight leaving an hour late, I still managed to have a pleasant flight. Crew were great, and I was also surprised that there was complementary wifi onboard. Not many carriers that I've traveled on offer this amenity free! If I have an option to travel within the USA, I would choose JetBlue Airways.",1
2017-09-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to New York JFK,,,,,,1.0,1,case of airline apathy,False,"  Orlando to New York JFK. On September 5 at 5:15 PM I booked a flight to be out of Florida before Hurricane Irma arrived. Jet Blue accepted my reservation and payment without hesitation. After all, this was days before the hurricane was due to arrive. 22 hours later, I received an automated message telling me that my ""flight for today has been cancelled"" and that I could change it on line or call and have it changes. First the flight was for tomorrow not today, so I was confused I went on line. Online, it did not show the flight cancelled. To be certain, I called the 1-800-Jet- Blue number. The very pleasant lady who answered the call told me she would look into it, but that she was actually in Orlando and no bad weather was anticipated for the day of my flight. Initially, she too saw that the flight was not cancelled. She put me on hold checked further and said that it now showed a weather cancellation. According to Weather.com, at the time of my flight, there would be light rain and winds of 3 mph. I asked if she could book me on the first available flight preceding my cancelled flight. She cheerfully offered to do just that. There was one 3 hours earlier, was that ok? Of course it was. only to find out that that flight was also cancelled due to weather. She checked other airports, no luck. And to make it more enjoyable it was being cancelled because of weather, it was my problem not theirs. And because they had waited another day after accepting my reservation, finding another flight was more than difficult. Another case of airline apathy.",-1

Really bad experience today 9/6/2017 on flight 97 seat 25A. After sitting down it became clear the person next to be had incredibly bad breath, so bad that whenever I smelt it I literally wretched. Since the seatbelt sign was on I decided to wait before notifying the crew - big mistake. After about an hour after takeoff the seatbelt sign was still on so I pressed the call button and passed the crew member a note on my phone asking her if I could change seats. She said there were middle seats available and would let me know when she came back. She did come back - passed my seat many times including asking for drinks - but never mentioned the seat change request again, even though I was visibly unable to get good air and was basically crawling out of my seat. The seatbelt sign stayed on for the first 1.5 hours of the flight even though the air was calm and clear and we had long since flown out of the storms. Did the pilot forget to turn it off? After an hour everybody ignored it. The crew member never got back to me and I was unable to change seats even though I spotted at least two other seats available. That made for an extremely unpleasant four hours in the air and I will think twice before flying with JetBlue again in the future.",-1
2017-09-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,the worst airline experience,False,  Detroit to Fort Lauderdale. JetBlue is the worst airline experience I have ever had. Upon getting stuck in traffic due to a highway pile up. I still arrived at my boarding gate 11 minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave. As myself and another woman approach the ramp to board. They said you have to be here 20 minutes before your flight leaves to board! We watch the plane sit for another 10minutes then leave. I was rerouted to another flight hours later that flew into Boston. With hopes of making a connection flight to Ft Laurdale. Upon landing and running through Boston airport to reach a connection flight. I arrived 10 minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave and they once again allowed no boarding. Instead I am forced to wait 5 more hours on another flight. One of my vacation days is a total waste. This has been the worse flying experience of my life. This is my first and last time flying with JetBlue.,-1
2017-08-29,1.0,Business,Economy Class,New York JFK to Syracuse,5.0,,5.0,,,4.0,5,Thank you for your kindness,False,"  New York JFK to Syracuse. I have flown Jet Blue on and off since it first came into existence. Over the last 10 years my trips have primarily been to destinations that Jet Blue doesn't cover, but a flight to Syracuse took me back into their flight paths. I was very pleased on my outbound flight to find them just the same and more legroom than I get on international flights. But what made this trip better is that I needed a change in my (non-changeable) flight due to a family emergency and was pretty distraught on the phone. The person assisting me was professional and comforting and took care of getting me on the best flight to get me home, and made a hard trip far far easier. My typical flights are still outside the Jet Blue coverage areas, so I can't fly them as often as I would like after this experience: hoping this review makes up for that. Thank you for your kindness at a difficult time.",1
2017-08-24,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to New York JFK,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,crew members were pleasant throughout,False,"  My first and probably last time flying Jetblue. Outbound from O'Hare to JFK, we left over 30 minutes late and yet made an on-time arrival. How was that even possible? Pad your flight schedules much? On the way home, we pulled back only a few minutes late but then pulled over and waited on the tarmac for an hour an half. Although we were told that there was weather in between New York and Chicago, passengers got on their phones and found that the weather radar was completely clear. No storms at all. Crew members just gave sheepish grins when told this information. We then had to return to the gate so that a new crew could take over. Passengers were allowed to deplane (with all of their things) and told that they could buy food and then reboard. After another hour or so, all of us (including those who had already boarded the plane twice) were forced off into the terminal with all of our stuff. Five hours after the original departure time, we finally reboarded (some passengers for the third time) and eventually took off. The entertainment system cut in and out the entire trip, going dark for ten minutes at a time. There were no apologies given for that problem or the delays, just a passing thank you ""for your patience"" before the final (re-re)boarding. The crew members were pleasant throughout the ordeal, but they work for a complete joke of an airline. If I were New York, I would force it to remove the ""New York's Airline"" advertising that is up around town-to avoid guilt by association.",-1
2017-08-23,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Cleveland,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,never came back to charge me,False,"  Boston to Cleveland. Jetblue surprises me as a low-cost airline. The staffs were professional and courteous. I ordered two little bottles of white wine, and normally they would charge for it, but the attendant on my flight just said to me: ""don't worry about the payment, enjoy your wine first, I will come back later"", and he never came back to charge me! And I don't think anyone was charged for his drinks. On top of that, eveyone has a screen in front him/her to watch DirectTV, or if the flight is more than two hours, free movies! The Wifi on the flight was also free if you are a member of Jetblue""s frequent flyer program. I would definitely keep Jetblue in mind when flying US domestic flights in the future.",1

I've been flying since August 18th since 4pm - they cancelled my flight the same day I was traveling, when I called they said yes ma'am this happens all the time. I understand this part, but your job is look for another flight way before I called! They made me fly from the Raleigh airport to Boston to get with the surprise that as soon as I got to Boston I found out that my connecting flight to NY got delayed and I won't make it to my final destination! So I go over there trying for them to find me a new flight so I could make it on time and there was none, she told me I had to stay overnight and catch the next flight the next day at 12pm. I did that, I went to my gate and I slept there. Then someone from the airport woke me up and told me I couldn't sleep there and I had to go outside. They cancelled my flight and are kicking me out. Worst airline to fly with to be honest!",-1
2017-08-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Baltimore,,,,,,1.0,1,never fly JetBlue again,False,"  Boston to Baltimore. I bought a flight weeks ago for a 9:30 pm departure time. The flight was delayed initially by 25 minutes, then 1 hour, another hour and then another 40 minutes. The latest delay is a further 1 hour, 15 minutes.  As I am sitting here writing this review, 6 hours after arriving to the airport for my original flight with no end in sight, and I seriously will never fly JetBlue again. I have taken some shady flights in my day (Spirit, RyanAir, etc) but all of them are preferable to experience I had tonight. Congratulations, in exactly one booking you have ruined the entire JetBlue brand and that's pretty impressive.",-1
2017-08-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Nassau,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,first and last time,False," Worst experience ever. We were supposed to leave Fort Lauderdale to Nassau at 1 pm and Jetblue kept posponing the flight. They made us move from one gate to another one, then back to the initial one. Nobody had a straight answer. Am I gonna get back my vacation day? And my kids's one? First and last time.",-1
2017-08-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolutely awful experience,False,"  Orlando to Newark. I booked with JetBlue because I thought it would make my flying experience so much smoother. But on multiple occasions they have made it an absolute nightmare. Upon flying to Costa Rica, my flight was scheduled to depart at 8 AM. They delayed it an hour at a time over seven times and then they completely cancelled the flight at 2PM. There were no other flights from JetBlue until the next day, meaning most of us lost money on hotels, shuttles, and time wasted. They did not give me a credit for the time lost, they just partially refunded me for the ticket since I was also coming back from Costa Rica flying JetBlue. I am now in Orlando, trying to get back home to New Jersey, and the same nightmare is happening again. They delayed it by an hour and a half. Now they've delayed it by another 45 minutes. They are notorious for great customer service if you can actually make it on the plane. I have never had such an absolutely awful experience, and this has happened to me twice within a two week period, at two separate airports. Do not ever book with them unless you want your time wasted and nothing from them as an apology. I paid over $800, several months in advance.",-1

Then 9 to 9:30. Then 9:30 to 10. Then 10 to 11. Then 11 to 12:30PM. Then 12:30 to 1. Then, after waiting several hours in the airport (since I got there two hours before you depart, 6AM), they cancelled the flight and said there were no more until the following day. I had a shuttle to catch in the morning and it cost $350 to reschedule the shuttle because I was traveling five hours away from the airport. If they had just cancelled it to begin with I could have booked with another airline to make it there on time. I ended up going to a completely different airport and flying with United, who bumped me to first class! I made it to Costa Rica on time because of them. JetBlue gave me more than a headache, it was an absolute disaster of a travel experience, a nightmare, and they offered no compensation other than a refund. They randomly booked me on another flight that I never asked for (I was booking with another airline who could get me there on time), and I had to spend over an hour on the phone with a JetBlue agent to reimburse me the money properly. I am now returning with JetBlue, and the delays have begun again. We are already an hour and forty minutes into the delay. Do yourself a favor and don't fly JetBlue.",-1

So many people have my exact experience - my connecting flight from San Juan to Orlando was cancelled on August 12th. They could not get my 3 family members on a flight until Tuesday the 15th. We settled for a flight to Ft Lauderdale on the 13th, paying to rent a car for the drive to the Orlando airport. This flight has now been delayed three times, and I am waiting for the cancellation. There is no customer service - they offer little to nothing to assist in getting you back to the city for which you purchased a ticket",-1

Wifi didn't work and then the TVs broke on my entire row. We were issued a service credit of $15, however this is unable to be used on already booked flights (ie our return leg a month later). After discussing this with the service department I was transferred to a very rude and unhelpful surpervisor. She would not allow me to use this credit for my future flight ( as it was booked before the malfunction took place) as ""that's not how it works"". If I could cancel my upcoming flight for a full refund and book with another airline I would. Will never fly with them again because of their poor customer service and malfunctioning equipment.",-1

Traveling with my whole family, we have spent from 10:30am traveling to a destination that's only 5 hours away. Arrival time now delayed to 2:30 in the morning. Traveled almost 24 hours. I will never fly Jetblue and I would never recomend to anyone. I am literally transferring my balance and canceling my Jetblue card asap. Anyone who sees this review please think twice before booking. It's now 7pm and our flight leaves at 11 and we get home at 2:30am worst traveling experience ever. Would recomend flying with another airline first.",-1
2017-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Punta Cana,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Worst trip ever,False,"  Richmond to Punta Cana via Fort Lauderdale/Boston. Just perused recent reviews and feel like my story was already told! Numerous times.  Worst trip ever - coming and going! Left Richmond VA for Punta Cana, DR via Fort Lauderdale on Aug 3. #645/#173. 2.5 hour delay from FL because apparently, Jetblue neglected to assign a pilot to the flight! Called Jetblue from terminal, and was informed that I must have misunderstood gate employee as no one from Jetblue would ever make such an announcement re: the lack of a pilot! I explained to rep that we were meeting group from NY in DR to share hour transport to hotel that had already been paid for. Rep went on to explain they would need at least 5 days to evaluate who was at fault for the delay of a flight with no pilot assigned and to call back at that time to see if we would be compensated. Needless to say we had to pay another $70.00 for transport to hotel. Return trip: From Punta Cana, DR to Boston (#896) for lay over, then on to Richmond VA.(#1281). Left DR at 12:48 with 5:00 arrival time in Boston to catch a 6:50 connection to Richmond. When we were still in the air at 5:15, expressed concern to flight attendant that we would be unable to get through customs and traverse the entire airport in what was looking like less than an hour. We were assured we would have no problem. Landed and got off plane about 5:35, flew through terminal begging anyone who would listen, customs, Jetblue employees, TSA, etc. that we had a connecting flight. They couldn't care less. Even had Jetblue employee send us in the totally wrong direction dragging 3 suitcases which probably cost us at least 15 precious minutes. Thank God for the other passengers on TSA line who let us cut to front! My poor husband got through 1st and went flying to gate to beg that they await our arrival only to discover flight had already closed doors at 6:35! First we were told there was another flight to Richmond at 7:00. Then we were informed that was a mistake, the next was at 9:00 pm. Asked to speak with supervisor who was only interested in the specifics of our flight times, and then informed us that the problem was with whomever booked our flight as Jetblue always recommends at least 2 hours between connecting flights to avoid exactly what we just went through. When we informed him we had booked the entire trip through Jetblue Vacations, and shouldn't his airline know their own policy, he had nothing to say! In the middle of exchange, another employee came over, whispered in his ear and and he took off-no explanation. After waiting 20 minutes because of course, the supervisor of an airline in the middle of hearing a complaint from one of their customers would return, we went looking for him! Found him behind a counter talking to another employee. Watched for about 5/10 minutes until he turned around and saw me. This guy had no intention of returning to finish our conversation! So-long story short, we got a $40 voucher for food which in airline-ese is 2 hamburgers - found out our luggage had somehow made the very flight we missed and got home to Richmond at midnight. Note: Flight crew on #381 were fabulous, as was unknown employee at Logan check in counter who somehow got our liquor boxed and on flight after another Jetblue employee gave us the totally wrong info on how to transport!",-1

Plane is currently in Fort Lauderdale being serviced. We booked a direct flight because I have back problems and can't handle long layovers (need place to lay down). First day of our vacation (long overdue) ruined due to Jetblue. Wondering if we will be stuck here overnight and have to wait all day tomorrow too,-1

I would like to thank JetBlue for making our travel a little bit easier our flight was delayed for hours and we had three children first time flying for them. They let my children go into the cockpit and look around this was awesome for them. We had a nice flight, when we departed from Fort Lauderdale we got held up in security due to my youngest daughter leaving a tablet in her bag that I forgot to take out - a representative from jetblue came and took my husband and three children to the gate to board and came back got my bag and rushed me to the gate.

Zero communication. Unfriendly Jetblue staff that lied and dodged questions. Staff members continually told us they knew nothing about our flight and that they weren't working the flight yet all if them were our crew upon boarding. Zero accommodation. Upon landing they disappeared. We were directed by Jetblue staff with no verbal conversation but hand motions shuffling us from one place to the next only to end up in the completely opposite part of the airport for bag claim with our entire fellow passengers. Over 100 people had to reroute across whole airport due to their lack of care after a three hour delay.,-1

I flew by jetblue many times in last 6 month. 90% of the times my flight was delayed. It was not like small delay but overnight delays. It is pathetic. They give credit of $75.this credit can be used only on jetblue flights. What is the use? I dont want to travel by their airline anymore. They dont care about customers. Time and energy wasted during these delays are priceless. I have missed important meetings because of these delays. They give weather reasons every time. When every other airline is on time.,-1
2017-08-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Boston,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,missing my connection,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Boston. Traveling back from Florida with my wife and two young daughters Jetblue sent me an email at 7:47am, 3 hours before my flight 2020 FLL-Worcester was scheduled to take off at 11:06am, that our flight was canceled. Agents on the phone were no help, only offering a flight leaving at 9:25am as an option. They claimed the flight was canceled for mechanical issues; somehow I don't believe that and this was some sort of cost saving cancellation. We rushed to the airport for the 9:25am flight only to be met by bumbling ticket agents who couldn't process customers quick enough. When it was out turn we were locked out. After running in-between terminals we were re-booked on Flight 376 to Philadelphia with a connection to Boston (yes, not our original destination). Flight 376 which was scheduled to depart at 1:32pm was a fiasco from the start. The flight boarded all passengers only to tell us that we'd be delayed as the flight had no water so they needed to wait for hand sanitizer - this wait was over 40 minutes. Stormy weather blew in, the runway was closed and we missed the window. After several openings and closings of the runway we finally took off at 3:30pm - 2 hours after our scheduled departure. The late takeoff meant we would cut it very close for our connecting flight 660 out of Philadelphia for Boston. I received a notification on my phone that the flight had been delayed till 6pm. With our estimated arrival in Philadelphia of 5:45pm I was hoping we'd be able to just make it. I asked the stewardess to speak with the captain as there were around 15 of us that had our Worcester flight 2020 canceled and were rebooked on these flights. I dreaded the thought of missing my connection because of the plane's lack of water and need for a hand-sanitizer delivery that took 40 minutes. The stewardess returned and said she spoke with the captain who would try to hold the flight. About 10 minutes before our landing another stewardess went on the intercom and told all theBoston bound passengers to relax because our gate was right next to Boston flight 660's E2, and that the plane would wait for us as the captain had called ahead. That was a major relief to hear that news. She also explained that we'd be let off the plane first ahead of other passengers to expedite our plane change. This was also a relief to hear considering my carry-ons and precious kid cargo. I nearly texted my father to pick us up at Logan (he was driving from N. Grafton in Worcester county), but I hesitated, wanting to be 100% sure. Well, unfortunately my apprehension proved deserved. When the door to the plane opened there wasn't any parting of the seas to let us through. In fact, both stewardesses who communicated with us disappeared, presumably shying away from the hidden truth. I yelled aloud whether we were being let off first but no one replied. I then looked out the plane's window - there wasn't any plane at E2 - flight 660 had already taken off! I walked down the gate corridor completely bewildered; the crew members were still nowhere to be seen. Upon exiting the gate, the JetBlue ticket agent handed me a new set of tickets. I asked where flight 660 went? The agent replied that it had taken off at 5:47, 13 minutes ahead of schedule and that we were now rebooked on the 8:41pm flight 760. Needless to say, all Boston bound passengers were furious - not sure if I can fly Jetblue for a while!",-1

I was supposed to leave at 7.10 pm on a Thursday night. The flight continued to get delayed until 1am. They finally told us the flight was canceled. Then we waited for an hour to get booked on an 11am flight for Friday morning. The exact quote was ""we guarentee you will be booked on the 11am flight"". I am now at the airport at 10am and our flight has been pushed back to 4.45pm. This airline consistently gave no information and was extremely reactive with no helpful options. They gave us a 250 voucher, but who wants a voucher for an airline that treats customers like this and their flights can't take off on time. This will be the first and last time I ever fly Jetblue. Disclaimer: these delays were all under control of the airline. Twice we've been told flight was delayed due to pilot running out of legal hours. This is in control of a business as you know how long your pilots fly, and they still promised us times for flights that were unrealistic.",-1

Second time (and last time) flying Jetblue Airways from Port au Prince to Pittsburgh via Ft Lauderdale. Booked this flight because I had a $50 credit from my first disaster with this airline. I really hesitated booking this flight but thought I would give them a second chance. They proved to be the same disastrous mess they were the first time. Sitting in Ft Lauderdale airport, 3 hours delayed, on the floor because there are Jetblue delayed customers everywhere. Over 90% of all outgoing and incoming Jetblue flights on the screen are delayed! (The weather here is perfect, not the cause of the problem). Let me add, all shops and restaurants in this terminal close at 9pm! We are stuck here till 11.:30 (unless Jet Blue changes that for the 6th time today) and not even one offer of food or snacks from Jet Blue. This was not worth the $50 I saved!

One more time JetBlue becomes a nightmare re delays, customer service and total flight quality. Flight delayed 4 hours with no reason.

For this flight from Bogota to Fort Lauderdale with Jetblue we've been in the airport for almost 6 hours. We boarded the plane and after 2 hours we were advised it would be taken to a hangar. 2 hours later we were told we would return to the airport for food. After 1.5 hours in line we got some horrible food. No information from the airline after 6 hours. What I see is many passengers that are already in their second delay because of the same issue. It seems it is the way it works. There is no one to speak to - just write an email and wait for response which can take one month.,-1

General trend is that most staff members (airport and flight attendants) are rude and have big attitudes. Customer care is the last thing they know. The flight attendant showed zero patience and didn't wait for 5 seconds on my drink order. She said she will comeback to take order and never did. We were family of 4 and our seats were scattered all over. When we requested to be seated together, they said the flight is completely full and they can't do it. However there were empty seats throughout. JetBlue will be my last choice when I book my next travel.",-1
2017-07-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Washington,5.0,,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4,flight and crew was also great,False,"  Had a stopover in Boston, coming from Lisbon to Washington DC. Stopover was originally 5 hours, but bad weather ended up making it 7. A lot of the flights were getting cancelled to Washington, so lots of people were trying to get standby on mine. I ended up hanging out in the corner near the gate's counter for about 5 hours, watching the Jetblue employees work. They seemed to be very friendly and accommodating with the flyers and I imagine it was very stressful. After sitting in the corner for 5 hours, one of the Jetblue employees asked to see my ticket and put me in a much better, premium seat and allowed me to board first because he felt bad I had spent so many hours at the gate. The flight and crew was also great. I've flown Jetblue only a few times, but have yet to experience an unpleasant experience.",1

Quite often you will find that their flights are delayed due to maintenance that they do to the plane before departure. In the last two flights I have taken with them one flight was delayed three times making me lose my connecting flight and forcing me to fly out next day. The second time it is delayed because they are working on the plane. This is the last time I will fly this airline.,-1
2017-07-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Boston,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,never book JetBlue again,False,"  Washington to Boston. This airline is fine should you not actually want to go anywhere. I felt like I was in kindergarten with a make-believe airline. I booked through Emirates. Foolish me, instead of booking a direct flight out of IAD with Emirates, I thought to save several hundred dollars by booking a cheaper flight with connecting JetBlue flights through BOS and JFK. Big mistake. I should have paid the premium for an Emirates only booking and completely avoid JetBlue. Flight staff have the friendliness but incompetence of high school interns. Weather delay I understand. I drove through the rainstorm. At the check-in counter, I specifically asked the staff  at the counter if I would make my connecting flight to Emirates in BOS. He responded that the connection was tight but good. Wrong. At the gate, just before boarding, I and four other people were informed that we would miss our connections, and needed interline tickets. The staff at the gate spent an hour on the phone getting interline tickets for the other four passengers, and when she got to me, then after another twenty minutes on the phone, she informed me that I had just missed an interline ticket with Qatar Airways by fifteen minutes, and could only go the next day - a loss of 24 hours for me. She talked to me in the nicest department store customer service voice, but was incompetent. I missed a whole day on my vacation. JetBlue should have booked the interline ticket immediately at the check-in counter when they had told me that the connection to my Emirates flight out of BOS was tight. Returning connection JFK to IAD. I landed at JFK timely with Emirates, and put my checked bag on the connections check-in counter, and proceeded to JetBlue Terminal. I saw on the Departures Board that my connecting JetBlue flight from JFK to IAD was several hours away, but that there was an earlier JetBlue flight. I asked the staff at the Help Desk if I could get a boarding pass for the earlier flight. He asked me if I had a checked bag, and I replied that I already had checked in my bag at the transfer connecting flights counter. And so then he said that ""no"" I couldn't get an earlier flight because my bag was already checked in for the later flight and was going to be on that flight. Okay, fine. I understand. So I took my originally booked flight, my first actual flight on a JetBlue aircraft, which took off about two hours late (being a small discount aircraft flight at the very end of the day, I kind of understand that.) Upon arrival at IAD, I looked and looked for my checked bag at Carousel 10. After many bags went by, I looked around the carousel, and saw my bag sitting inside the JetBlue baggage office. It had come on the earlier flight! So here I am at Dulles at two o'clock in the morning with my bag, calling for my pickup ride, when I could have been calling for my pickup ride at a more civilized hour in the early evening! I specifically asked the staff at the gate if food would be provided onboard the aircraft. I was told ""no."" So I stocked up on some snacks at the nearby snack kiosk. Needless, I was served cookies and Sprite onboard. I shall never book JetBlue again.",-1

2017-07-16,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Philedelphia,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,had 3 delays leaving Boston,False,  I had 3 delays leaving Boston and then for my return flight I received an email that my flight was canceled. Soon an automated voicemail and email reported a next day new flight. However I had planned to fly out after a conference and had no reservation to stay in PA. I called customer service who told me to go to the airport to talk with someone at the Jetblue Kiosk who might be able to offer some compensation. I asked for clarification-you are telling me to pay to travel to the airport where you have already notified me that my flight is canceled to possibly offer me compensation. Yes the rep offers. I am horrified - what if this was my daughter flying. What would she do in a city by herself without a hotel? I checked the website and entered my flight info - no compensation. Thankfully I did not spend $60 getting to the airport to learn this. Unacceptable.,-1
2017-07-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,New York to Seattle,,,,,,1.0,1,lack of procedure and incompetence,False,"  New York to Seattle. The incompetence and lack of ownership from JetBlue's side astounds me. I am unlikely to ever fly this airline again. From my flight being cancelled (Flight 263), to them loosing my luggage and blaming everyone else (Emirates, Me, Customs, etc) but themselves, to their inundated Customer Service people spending 30 to 60 minutes on the phone per customer to attempt to get them on other flights. I spent almost 6 hours at JFK figuring out what I needed to do as their customer service representatives were so unhelpful and made almost no announcements to anyone to let us know what was actually going on. I stood in one line for 2 hours and then another for another 2 hours and at no point were we given any clear guidance as to what was actually happening. Once I finally got a ticket out of New York for 2 days after the cancelled flight, I was told that JetBlue would not cover accommodation due to the flight being cancelled on account on bad weather. There was no bad weather in New York at the time that we arrived or the time the flight was supposed to depart. I spoke to several passengers who were all going to very different destinations, Seattle, Charleston, Boston, etc and all flights were cancelled which tells me that the weather issue was not the destination or on route, it was the source (New York), and seeing that there was actually no rain an just some clouds, it seems ludicrous that they would have us believe that the flights were cancelled due to bad weather.  The fact that these sorts of things must happen every day, so for me to spend 6 hours in a airport, sorting everything from flights, to accommodation, to taxis, to my lost luggage which up to today no one had logged a ticket for, is absolutely unacceptable and it boggles my mind that they are still operating with this level of inefficiency, lack of procedure and incompetence.",-1
2017-07-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,New York to Seattle,,,,,1.0,1.0,1,last time I use this airline,False,  My flight was cancelled today from New York to Seattle. I have been waiting in the customer service line for over an hour to find out what my next steps are. The staff have been absolutely useless and insanely slow. They are taking so unacceptably long to turn over customers. Some of the same people are still waiting at the service counter. This will undoubtedly be the last time I use this airline again!,-1

It used to be our go to airline to fly into Orange County. Three flights over the course of the past two weeks have resulted in 2 + hour delays for two of the flights and a missing crew for the other flight resulting in a 1+ hour delay. Will look for alternate airlines from here on out!,-1
2017-07-09,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Nantucket,3.0,,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,frequent flights cancellation,False,"  We were trying to fly by JetBlue (flight 1752) yesterday to Nantucket from Boston. Flight has been delayed due to ""weather conditions"" and finally canceled - and we have been rebooked to connecting flights via JFK, so will spend whole day flying. No compensation. Killed Saturday. The irony is there were many flights same day which successfully taken off from Boston and landed in Nantucket same time with canceled JB flight. Not been stopped by weather. Looks like when you are JetBlue and have a lot of free seats next day on others flights, nothing prevents to cancel a flight and save a lot of money - no matter what plans people have. From other review here it seems I am not alone and frequent flights cancellation from JetBlue is common practice, so avoid flying them unless you have no other option - or have plenty of free time and money.",-1

One was for me and the other was for my son. For some reason, my son was not able to travel with me, but I still kept the ticket and checked in for him. Since I paid for the ticket, I wanted to keep the seat vacant for more space. When I was boarding at the gate, Jetblue staff took my son's boarding pass away from me. She said that since my son was not boarding, Jetblue needed to have the boarding pass back, and to remove my son from the flight customer list. I asked if Jetblue would give the seat to the others. The Jetblue staff said that they can and that's how it work. I was surprised of the information.  Nevertheless, the seat of my son was left open today because they didn't need it (the staff told me).",-1
2017-07-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Buffalo via Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,thoroughly disappointed me,False,"  New York to Buffalo via Boston. Jetblue thoroughly disappointed me over the Holiday Weekend. I was supposed to go home on June 30th at 10:30 pm out of JFK, but that did not happen. My flight was delayed for hours, until, they finally cancelled it. Not only did the support team have no remorse or sympathy, the only flight they could get me on was the next day at 8 am, which had a 5 hour layover in Boston and wouldn't get to Buffalo until the next day at 8 pm. I had no guarantee I would not get stuck in Boston the next day. My trip was cancelled, I was stranded at New York JFK at 3 in the morning, with no way to get home but spend $100 on an Uber back to my home in Jersey. I was inconvenienced, exhausted, and upset. I waited in the customer service line for two hours, only for their support team to tell me they could not refund me. I was finally refunded the next day after waiting on hold for an hour. It was not weather - it was that this airline could not handle the magnitude of flights booked for the Holiday Weekend and did not have enough Pilots. Maybe if the customer service team was a bit more caring, efficient and helpful, I would consider flying with Jet Blue, but not even one ounce of remorse or care-that shows me how valued we are as customers.",-1
2017-06-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago O'Hare to Vermont via JFK,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,we got no answers or help,False,"  Based on my experiences of 6/22/2017 and 6/24/2017 I will never purchase another fare from JetBlue and I will never recommend them to anyone. In the spring I began making plans to attend my daughters graduation from grad school in Vermont. Using Expedia, I searched for a reasonable fare and decided on JetBlue. The fares I purchased included a flight from O'Hare to JFK with a short layover at JFK and then a flight to Vermont. The same package in reverse was available for us three days later when we wanted to return home. So in all I purchased three fares, one for myself, my husband and youngest daughter and altogether, we were scheduled for two flights to get to Vermont and two flights to return to Chicago. On the drive into O'Hare on the morning of 6/22/2017 I received a text message that the flight to JFK and then the connecting flight to Vermont had been cancelled. There was no reasonable explanation given. Here were all my hopes of getting to Vermont cancelled in a brief, cold text message. I called Expedia who helped me arrange for another flight to Burlington but they also told me to keep the flight with JetBlue for my return flight on 6/24/2017 as they hadn't cancelled those two flights. Bad idea. I should of cancelled it and made changes right then but I thought this kind of event was something unusual. On Saturday 6/24/2017 when we went to the airport in Vermont to depart, the JetBlue flight was delayed for around four hours. JetBlue arranged for us to get a later connecting flight to Chicago that was suppose to leave around 6.00. When we got to JFK, the flight to Chicago was on the board and it said ""on time"". I think we may have been there an hour or so and suddenly the status of the flight was changed to ""cancelled"". Again, we got no answers or help from JetBlue's customer service with the exception of telling us where we could pick up our checked bag in the airport and rescheduling a plane the next day that we later learned would supposedly leave some time around 2.00 in afternoon and get us home by 9.30 after two connecting flights. Fearing we would be stranded in yet another city we made other arrangements. Essentially, we were left stranded at JFK by JetBlue. There were no available hotel rooms this weekend as it was Pride weekend in New York City and all the hotels were booked. We searched for rooms, Expedia searched for us and after using the services at JFK we learned there was nothing available. We were given no help or direction from JetBlue that was meaningful or helpful in our situation. We had never been to New York and only expected our stay to be a brief one as a connecting flight. No room, no reciprocity with another carrier. So to be clear, three out of the four flights we had arranged months in advance were cancelled by JetBlue with just the flick of a text message. I will never fly JetBlue ever again. I am utterly appalled for what passed as service and the willingness to leave people stranded with no assistance. There are few words to describe the service we received from JetBlue over this weekend but it was punctuated with an attitude of ""aww too bad"" and your on your own. I would like to thank the people who did help us at JFK but they were were from a different carrier, who actually got us home the next morning.",-1

The flight was delayed for 6+ hours and then they cancelled the flight because they could not find a cabin crew to work that flight after all the delays. The customer service was not very accommodating during this whole situation. They had overbooked the flight, but that was avoided altogether because they ended up cancelling the flight after making people wait for a 6+ hours. They did not want to refund or rebook and all $$$ I had spent on the flight is gone. The frontdesk person was also not as helpful (granted people's tempers were already fuming after not being given ample communication beforehand that the flight might get cancelled and having been made to wait for 6 hours during the wee hours of the night). I ended up missing all the important appointments planned as a result of this incident. I will never fly JetBlue again.",-1

I will never fly Jetblue Airways again. My flight here was first delayed by four hours. Then my return flight was delayed by two hours because they held a plane for another group from another city, causing me to miss my connection. It seems this airline can't keep its schedule even remotely. I'm losing an entire day because they ran some numbers and figured it was easier to screw the smaller number of flyers. I'll pay a little extra to fly with airlines I can trust like Alaska Air.",-1
2017-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,multiple delays,False,"  Multiple delays of 2-3 hours on both flights leaving on 6/16 and returning on 6/25 flying from Orlando to Newark. ""Maintenance issues"". As the gate number also kept changing, we could see many other JetBlue flights were delayed. Really disappointing! Won't be flying with Jetblue again.",-1

The airport staff that helped me with booking of my flight was helpful. I requested an earlier flight instead of the stated flight time that was given to me in Lisbon, and the staff did everything to get me on board with the earlier time. I would give 5 star for this service.",1

First flight was cancelled 3 hours before departure with no other flight options that day. Had to leave in the evening the following day and that flight was delayed 2 hours. An entire 24 hours of vacation lost forever. Return flight was delayed an hour. Weather was clear both days at our airport as well as the airport the plane was coming from. This errand I could care less about your time they just want your money.,-1
2017-06-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,everything went wrong,False," JetBlue is the worst airline, first time flying this company from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas and everything went wrong. First 3 gate changes, 2 hours to get on the plane through the rudest gate staff you can imagine. Once on as we taxi, the pilot says there's thunder while other planes take off, then half an hour after it turns out to be a mechanical problem they are going to ""try to fix"". Please see attached picture for the riveting entertainment, and the wifi doesn't work either.",-1
2017-06-11,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Anchorage,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,3,this year it has gone downhill,False,"  Flew Jetblue from Portland to Anchorage. Customer service was horrible at the ticket counter. We were traveling with someone with a wheelchair and the staff member gave us the wrong information. After waiting for four hours she told my husband he could go right to baggage drop and they refused to assist him and sent him to the end of the line. Not helpful at all. Not sure what happened, last year they had excellent service and this year it has gone downhill. This is the second time we have flown this summer.",-1

First flight delayed so we missed the second. Still waiting 2nd flight that's been delayed twice. Probably will be spending the night at JFK for reasons no one will share with us.

2017-05-29,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Boston,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,4,it just isn't worth the savings,False,"  Charlotte to Boston. JetBlue is a good carrier if you fly to and from a JetBlue hub. If not, I would not fly on this airline. 100% of my direct flights from Charlotte to Boston return  have been either late or canceled. In all cases, it was important for me to get to my destination on time. JetBlue tends to be slightly better priced than American on these routes, but I have concluded it just isn't worth the $25-$35 savings.",-1
2017-05-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Syracuse via New York JFK,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,first and last time on Jetblue,False," Thought that I'd try Jetblue for the first time when they posted the cheapest flight for the first time in the 3 years I've been flying between San Antonio / Austin and New York. In the end I've come to the conclusion, as I'm waiting overnight in the JFK terminal for 8 hours that they really just don't care. I originally scheduled travel to leave on the evening of 25 May but I was informed that the flight would be delayed out of Austin for 3 hrs and as a result would miss my connection at JFK. The earliest they'd be able to get me out of JFK on the 26th would be 4pm, so I changed my flight to depart Austin on the 26th. The same flight on the 26th was again delayed from 5:06pm to 5:50 pm and I called to ensure that I would still make my connection. The phone agent confirmed I would make the connection so I drove to Austin to catch my flight. While waiting at the gate the flight was delayed again, now to 6:25pm. Attendant at the gate confirmed that I would make my connection. As I was boarding the plane I was told that I'd have to check my carry-on. I explained that I had a tight connection in JFK, but was reassured by the gate that it wouldn't be a problem. As we approached JFK the flight had to circle until we were diverted to refuel in Philly for return to JFK. Once we finally landed at JFK it was 12:30am and thought I would have time to catch my connecting flight however, no one from Jetblue met the plane and the crew did not provide connection information. I looked at the departure boards but my flight was not listed. As I attempted in vain to search the gates for my departing flight and access the flight status option on the website (which did not work) I went to the previous gate I was told the flight would be at before it had been delayed several times, but it was not there and the only manned ""Just Ask"" station in the terminal was in close proximity but with twenty people in line. So I called the 1-800 number and it was obvious that the phone agent was not well trained and tried to inform me that my next flight was my departure flight on the 29th and all my previous flights had departed on time. She had no idea that my flights had been delayed and informed me that the only available flight was 8:36am that morning. I asked then why had I received texts that my connecting flight was not departing until 01:07am and she couldn't explain it but asked if I wanted to change my flight as if I had a choice. When I said yes, she stated that she would have to get a supervisor to allow her to make the change. That process took about 30 minutes and at the conclusion she told me that I needed to talk to an employee at the terminal to confirm the information she'd provided me. When I finally got to the front I was told that the flight had indeed been delayed and that I could have caught that flight and my bag had made it on the flight. Why wouldn't the flight be on the departure screens? So now I have no access to my bag during the 8 hour layover. To top it off, I requested to talk to a supervisor and was told that someone would come talk to me but it could take a while, I have 8 hours to spend here anyway so said sure I'll wait. Two hours later I was told that the supervisor would not be able to speak with me and that if I truly wanted to speak with one that I would need to exit security and search for one at the ticket counter. Had I known, I would have canceled my travel plans. First and last time I'll fly on Jetblue.",-1
2017-05-25,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Washington,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,two very unpleasant experiences,False,"  I have had two very unpleasant experiences with JetBlue recently. Lost baggage. Significant delays and missed connection to desired airport. Had to reroute to another airport. In regards to the first unpleasant experience, lost baggage. Luggage never left JFK airport, my departure airport. My ultimate destination was La Paz, Bolivia, with a connection to Washington IAD from New York JFK. Representative sent me to the incorrect terminal after I was already at the correct terminal (Terminal 5). This already caused a stressful situation. Secondly, upon my arrival, my bags did not arrive to my final destination, La Paz. The second awful experience was due to a severe delay and missed connection. Once again, JetBlue. I've already spent enough time writing complaints, I would prefer not to anymore. Avoid at all costs.",-1
2017-05-23,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to New York,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,attendants were more than friendly,False,"  Los Angeles to New York. Today was my 10th flight with JetBlue. Boarding was fast and efficient, 30 minutes after takeoff water bottles were handed out, orders taken for soft drinks and snacks handed out later on. The leg room was very good for this 5.5 hour leg. I purchased a cheese and cracker box for $9 which was amazing as well as a few drinks. An hour before landing crew members passed by with water bottles again. The downside on the A321 is that the remote on the seat is in the middle of the armrest and I kept on accidentally hitting the volume, I had to fiddle a little with the head phone jack. Wi-Fi worked perfectly throughout the flight and it was free. All the flight attendants were more than friendly.",1
2017-05-23,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Cancun,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,never been less than 3 hrs late,False,  Orlando to Cancun. Have flown to Cancun several times and the flight has never been less than 3 hrs late with jetblue. Their service and explanation as to why they are late is horrible. It appeared they claim it's an equipment problem when really it's lack of tickets sold and they want to move people to later flight,-1

We flew with a all-male crew. The announcer was amusing, informative, and entertaining It was a pleasant change. Service was great and made it a lot easier to deal with the hollering toddler. Good job JetBlue.",1
2017-05-20,1.0,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,New York JFK to Los Angeles,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,Service was superb,False,"  New York JFK to Los Angeles. This morning's flight was my ninth with JetBlue. Service was superb. Water bottles plus drink and snack service were given out about half hour after takeoff, a couple of trash runs made and if you needed to get anything the little fridge in between Mint and Even More Space with snacks as well as the back galley, towels were given out during initial descent. I bought a chicken sandwich since I was starving and it wasn't bad. I love the fact that I'm Even More Space you get so much room to stretch your legs out. The airline offered many free movies on demand as well as directTV. Looking forward to my flight back to NYC on Monday.",1
2017-05-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Richmond,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never book with JetBlue again,False,"  Orlando to Richmond. Stranded at the gate without any notification. The JetBlue ap still had the flight listed as ""On Time"" but the flight at the gate changed to another destination. No notice and no flights out of Orlando to Richmond that day. Our business client was left stranded. We will never book a flight with JetBlue again. If you depend on your airline to deliver on what they sell loof elsewhere. Clearly with the long line of passengers waiting to find alternate flights due to the multiple JetBlue canceled flights, this is standard practice for JetBlue. If the flight isn't full, they cancel and cut their losses at the expense of the passengers. A simple refund will not make up for our loss of revenue and our disappointed client left stranded in Richmond. Stay clear of this airline!",-1
2017-05-16,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to San Jose,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,Service was amazing,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to San Jose (Costa Rica). Boarding process was very relaxed despite the fact the the flight was full. We paid the upgrade to ""even more space"". The comfort and space were unparalleled. Wifi on board, Live TV. Staff willing to help. Everything was on time. Right before taking off we were notified that there was a problem with one of the slides. They attempted to repair it while we were on board and were unable to do so. They apologized and had to request that we get off the airplane while they tried to work on it. The captain remained at the gate updating passengers as he received information. They managed to fix everything within 30 minutes. All in all, we were delayed by 2 hours. But we understand that it happens. The airline did what it needed to do: fix the problem and make sure the passengers were safe, informed and reassured. The flight was flawless, service was great. Attendants were professional, kind and taking care of passengers. In 24 hours I received an email with an airline credit and apologies for the delay. On our way back, we sat in regular economy seats. Leg room was ample. Service was amazing. Couldn't ask for more.",1
2017-05-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to New York,3.0,,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,disappointed by my experience,False,  Boston to New York. I am so disappointed by my experience with JetBlue from two weeks ago. After sitting on the plane on the runway for an hour we were all told to exit the plane and wait in a very long line to figure out how to fix our travel plans. There were about 5 of us traveling to Honolulu who got completely screwed because we missed our connecting flight. The only option for us was to wait 12 hours for a flight to Vegas > Honolulu then a 3 hour delay before finally flying to Lihue for me. This means I missed my first night in my hotel. I was 14 hours late to my final destination. I missed my shuttle and had to pay for a taxi which was ridiculously expensive. When I wrote to JetBlue they refused to reimburse me for anything and gave me a $50 credit. You can't fly anywhere for $50.  This company is worth hundreds of millions of dollars yet they can't afford to pay for their mistakes.,-1
2017-05-10,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Las Vegas,2.0,,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3,JetBlue is getting a thumbs down,False,"  New York to Las Vegas. We were to fly out of New York May 5th, but they canceled our flight. I understand weather and such, but delay it would have been better. I called customer service to the tune of I am sorry, nothing we can do. We had a show that was paid for months ago and important to get to Las Vegas before 8pm. They could only get us on a 6-7pm flight which put us into LV after the show had started. Considering airlines were flying out in the afternoon, when the weather was better, JetBlue could not even accommodate by adding a flight that would have helped many of us who had to scramble for another airline. Every airline we checked was full or flying out in the evening. You could imagine how upset I was. JetBlue has a high cancellation record and I have been flying with them since the beginning. Dealing with TV's that haven't worked to sometimes unfriendly crew members, I brushed it off. When customer service on the phone says this has happened to them and they didn't take it out on the person trying to help them, after asking them how would they feel if this happen to them? That was wrong. Flying home on JetBlue was terrible. Full flight and the TV's did not work. It was a new plane and they did not work. Crew was not that friendly, empty cups and soda bottles were left under the seats. I feel like they have overgrown. No regard for the inconvenience of their passengers who have to shell out hundreds more dollars for a flight with another carrier or who miss important events. If you cancel a flight, figure out rescheduling a little later. That is the right thing to do. Put another airplane into use with a crew. I will tell you, we flew out on Delta and I was very impressed. I have 2 more trips on JetBlue coming up and then I think I need to part ways. I felt at their mercy like they shrugged their shoulders. I have choices and they should understand that. Sometimes the lower fare is not the best choice. I have written them many times on their great service and flights. Now I can't say that. They price gauge for everything from seating room, $70 for more legroom and the seats are not much more comfortable. At least on Delta, seats are wider and more comfortable for an up charge. This put us out almost $500 that we did not expect to spend. Everyone has their opinion and experience with each airline. JetBlue is getting a thumbs down for the added stress it put on my short weekend in Vegas.",-1
2017-05-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to Los Angeles,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,staff were less than attentive,False,"  
Just flew JetBlue for the first time from Orlando to Los Angeles. The plane was dirty, the staff were less than attentive. They couldn't be bothered to help with service of any kind. We were in row 1 so the two times they did come by (once for food and once for trash), they rushed past our row without stopping to ask if we wanted or needed anything. We had to ask them to come back. I will avoid flying this airline again.",-1
2017-05-06,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Ft Lauderdale,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,incredible service from staff,False," First time flying with Jetblue from Detroit to Ft Lauderdale and I'm writing this review while I'm in the air because the wifi is free. Incredible service from staff and I fly frequently (delta, spirit, etc). The captain introduced himself before we flew and made sure to welcome us at the gate. I'm in an incredibly nervous flyer and when we hit turbulence the captain made sure not only to switch the seatbelt sign on and he took the time to reassure the passengers. He made me feel so much safer. The seats had plenty of room and the staff were excellent. Definitely will be flying Jetblue again.",1

My husband and I had a layover in Fort Lauderdale which was supposed to be for two hours. Instead, we were delayed for almost five hours. By the time we got to our hotel it was 1am. I can honestly say my family and will do all possible to refrain from flying JetBlue in the future. We paid for the even more space seats and we were squeezed in them. The seat space is just the distance from seat to seat. Not the seat itself.",-1

I was impressed from beginning to end. The check in staff were helpful and friendly. My flight attendants were excellent. The departures and arrivals both ways were flawless. The on-board amenities are bar none. In this day an age, excellent customer service is hard to find.",1
2017-05-01,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to New York,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,give credit where credit is due,False,"  Flew home last night flight from Las Vegas to New York JFK, flight 1248. Wanted to give credit where credit is due! This was the first flight I have flown where the captain came over the PA and made an announcement assuring us about the turbulence, how uncomfortable it can be for us but to be reassured the aircraft can handle these type of situations and not to worry. I felt he did everything he can possibly do to try and avoid the constant turbulence to make for a peaceful flight. Will make sure to make JetBlue as my first flight choice in the future.",1
2017-05-01,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to New York JFK,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,young and enthusiastic crew,False,"  The only criteria to book my connecting flight from Boston to JFK on this airline was the very convenient departure time. I had not flown on this airline before nor did I have any idea what I was going to expect. From entering the Terminal C in Boston until leaving the dedicated Terminal in JFK it was a unique and breathtaking experience. When I approached the self-check-in kiosks at Logan a smartly dressed employee came up to me and assisted me through the entire process. The whole check-in area had more the appearance of an After-work-lounge than an airport facility. Everything looked so classy, like out of some Hollywood movie. There were no lines at security and I was through in a breeze. Doors were closed on time. The seats on the small Embraer jet were comfortable, even for me as a tall guy. I took advantage of the live television broadcast on the individual screens and caught up with the latest political and weather news. There was a 30-minute-departure delay out of Boston but we reached the gate at JFK right on time. In-between the young and enthusiastic crew served softdrinks and snacks of high quality. Jet Blue is without any doubt the best American domestic carrier I have ever flown on.",1
2017-04-28,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to New York JFK,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,This really was not nice,False,"  Orlando to New York JFK. Very disappointed, was 1 minute late to check in at kiosk for a 6am flight and by the time I made it to the crew member it was another 4 mins in, the agent would not allow my family of 4 including a lap child to check in saying that I had to have checked in 40 mins prior to flight, and adding that the flights are booked due to a delay the evening before - and they had to accomodate several other passengers. This is ridiculous we had 3 paid seats which they gave away for a minute delay we could have easily made to the gate on time if the agent had shown a little care and checked us in. When I called the customer service center to report this issue they were not helpful and said there was nothing they could do. I am returning home and waiting to go back to airport for a 6:40 pm flight, enough of my issue a word of advice to whoever is flying and running a little bit behind make sure to take a few minutes to do online check-in so you can ensure that you are checked in 40 minute prior and then as needed print your tickets at kiosk. This really was not nice!",1
2017-04-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to New York,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,5.0,1,disappointed with Jetblue service,False,"  I flew from Salt Lake City to New York with my mother (76 years). I fell asleep then my mom woke me up telling me she was not feeling well. My mom almost passed out for a short time. I called the flight attendant who showed up I told her my mom does not feel well and I asked her for water, she grabbed a small bottle of water and disappeared. She could not even asked me what was wrong with my mother. I have no idea how this woman works as a flight attendant. Smile and be nice to people is not hard at all. Very disappointed with Jetblue service. They did not provide anything not even water. Flight 72 Saturday April 22 of 2017.",-1
2017-04-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1,lack of treatment to its patrons,False,"  Charleston to Fort Lauderdale. Today I should be on the spring break vacation with the young children and teenage nieces that I have been planning for 6 weeks. Due to a cancellation and no rebooking availability on Jetblue, I sit at home writing this oh so very true review. There are no considerable hotels available within driving distance. Thus, there is very little we can do at this point to overcome the disappoint our family is encountering. After two hours and getting no where with Jetblue, I am simultaneously attempting to cancel all other accommodations arranged for this trip. I am highly discouraged by this airline's lack of treatment to its patrons. Customer service under provided when it could have chosen to be highlighted as unforgettably amazing! Jetblue better step up its CS game or face serious future consequences. Empower your employees to do want is right in extenuating circumstances. We are people not systems. Southwest here we come again, gave JB straight one star because I wouldn't know - never boarded the flight and couldn't be rebooked for another. As it related to value for money, the minimal credit issued does not come close to covering our losses. My kids are heartbroken.",-1
2017-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,New York JFK to Los Angeles,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5,those people who switch our seat,False,"  New York JFK to Los Angeles, Whereas I've often seen that when a couple of family comes aboard separated they will sit together and when someone comes who has the seat they all work it out - with my volume of travel, and my teams', we're often those people who switch our seat, here's how JetBlue made this mess. There were no adjacent tickets available for purchase when we bought the tix so we ended up with two mint window seats and two aisle seats, each set on opposite sides of the aisle, my 11 year old son sat on his own but of course we couldn't leave my 7 year old little girl sitting alone by a window seat while my wife sat on the other side of the aisle without even full view of my daughter and have some stranger sit next to my little girl. So my wife sat next to my little girl until we could talk to the person in that seat - who we assumed would be reasonable like the rest of us. Then one of the gate staff came in and told my wife she had to move, leave my 7 year old little girl who still carries her pink blanket with her alone. I went up and told them there was no way we were leaving our little girl alone in that seat, wait for some stranger to sit there and hope the airline could work it out. The guy across the aisle was sweet amidst what was becoming a tense situation and offered to trade, which was great. I then went up to tell the pilot, stewardess and offending gate person that I was going to issue a formal complaint and rather than simply apologizing or even just saying something like ""I understand of course, go ahead"" he threatened to have our family wait for the next flight if I complained. I was speechless and since my wife and my daughter were now sitting together safely I let it go. Do they train these airline people on customer service and service recovery at all? Do you JetBlue?",1

Entire weekend cancelled, trip cancelled completely with no options and all they say is ""sorry, we can provide you a refund."" Seriously? You have got to be kidding, I took off two days off work and missed a wedding. They are not partners with any other airlines and I spoke with multiple supervisors, who offered nothing. First, they cancel my flight on Thursday from JFK to Charleston, they provide no solution for Thursday, they re-book me out of Philadelphia for the following day, Friday, with a layover. On Friday, they delay my flight so I would miss the layover. After hours on the phone without any solutions they give me a refund. Sorry, a refund does not cover the days I took off from work and the vacation that was completely ruined and the wedding that I missed!",-1

This is my 8th flight on jetBlue and service has always been impeccable. Crew are pretty friendly. On this flight there were two movies available for free , Wi-Fi, drinks and snacks were complimentary too and served about 45 mins after takeoff for our 3.5 hour flight back to New York. I flew with my partner as usual on a buddy pass and this time we were given one row each on Even More Space but opted to sit together, flight was almost full. The best thing about flying on the Embraer 190 is that it's one row of 2 seats on each side of the aircraft so if you're a couple like us there's no one sitting on either side. Thanks again for great service.",1

A brand new A321 was awaiting me at the gate. Aircraft was in great shape and the interiors were excellent. Professional service at MCO with a smooth and on-time check-in. A great variety of snacks and drinks are complimentary, which is something not seen in other domestic US carriers. Another aspect of JetBlue which made the journey comfortable was the complimentary Wi-Fi. Great service onboard and the journey seemed shorter than it usually feels due to the great facilities onboard. JetBlue is surely my choice of travel for all domestic journeys in the USA due to its modern fleet and great service.",1

My pet is a seizure alert medical service animal and the CRO denied my paperwork, medication I take for condition, and threatened to remove me from my flight because I stated he was discriminating against an individual with a disability.

It's an a la carte airline and not for families. If you are a single person with no luggage then it's a great airline. If you have a family then it's abysmal. I wasn't even able to sit next to my wife and children even after a service representative assured me that we would be next to each other. Cost us an extra five hundred dollars in fees to fly.,-1

I love Jetblue, however staff never follow their own rules regarding carry on baggage? 2 bags - a carry on and 1 personal item. One bag in the overhead space. If they actually enforced this, there would be room for everyone. I sit and watch people get on the plane with 3, sometimes 4 bags and I watch them put everything in the overhead bins. Then, people that pay just as much as everyone else, but board later, have to check their bags. This is so frustrating. Enforce the rules Jetblue - it's not that difficult.",1
2017-02-07,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Burlington to Washington,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,"frequent, extended delays",False,"  I have flown Jetblue for years and loved them. However, the last year has been a disaster for them. Flight delays and cancellations have become the rule rather than the exception. I don't usually write reviews, but this particular time I was suppose to fly from Burlington to Washington Dulles, which is considered a short flight. My flight was to leave Burlington at 5:40, with a layover in New York, and get to Virginia at 9am. It is now projected that I will arrive in Virginia at 12-1am. An almost 24 hour delay. I am sorry for the employees who have always been kind and respectful and demonstrated excellent customer service skills. Unfortunately, the frequent, extended delays are ruining the good name of this company. If you want to get where you are going on time, pick another airline.",-1

I was sceptical then to give a review as I thought let me give it some time, see if they are consistent. I love JetBlue because they are punctual, and the seats are the most comfortable of any airline I've flown, there is heaps of leg room in economy class. There is a screen in the back of the seat directly in front of me and I can watch whatever I choose to. In all a very comfortable, pleasant airline to fly with. I choose Jetblue over all others. Thank you for your service!",1
2017-01-31,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Boston,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3,I prefer good customer service,False,"  Phoenix to Boston. JetBlue Airways attracts it's customers with low prices for airfare as well as complimentary items such as their free 36 Direct TV channels on their in flight entertainment systems. However, while complimentary items and low airfare are nice, the customer service always needs to be a priority and that is what was lacking on Flight 602 service to Boston. Even though this was a Red-eye flight (aka an all-nighter), I believe that at the least flight attendants shouldn't be screaming for people to sit down. The attendants on this flight I can imagine probably don't like their shift but taking it out on the passengers isn't right. And while I understand that they have a tight schedule to keep they are perfectly capable of saying please and thank you every once in a while. All I have to say is that if you think low airfare and complimentary items beats Customer Service in the airline industry, then Jetblue Airways isn't so bad - but personally I prefer an airline with good customer service.",-1
2017-01-28,1.0,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,San Juan to New York JFK,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,attendants were extremely courteous,False,  San Juan to New York JFK. This is has been my fourth flight with JetBlue using a buddy pass with my partner and service has been awesome. Flight time was slightly under four hours back to JFK. Checkin at San Juan was a breeze since we had nothing but backpacks so we just printed the tickets on a machine and after arriving at the gate were informed our flight was gonna be delayed which wasn't a big deal. Afterwards we were called and assigned seats on Even More Space right behind L2. Flight attendants were extremely courteous and offered me a free snack box which was absolutely delicious. Afterwards drinks and snacks were served and we had a pretty smooth ride back home. I love the fact that each time I have flown with JetBlue everyone seems so upbeat from the ground crew to the flight crew. Looking forward to our next flight in a month or so.,1

Shortly after take-off I noticed my TV was not working. I quickly notified a flight attendant who was very nice and accommodating, and offering to switch my seat or offer me a credit towards next flight. Flying with a friend I opted out of changing my seat. Everyone was very nice and I love flying with Jetblue as I do often. However I was a little disappointed that I could not just sit back, watch a movie and enjoy the flight.",1
2017-01-22,0.1,Business,Business Class,Boston to San Francisco,,,,,,1.0,1,not honor the transaction,False,"  This is a review of the airline, not the flight, as I was not allowed to fly. I had an 8am flight from Boston to San Francisco in their version of Business Class, Mint. When I tried to checking online it would not allow me, so I went to the airport and at the kiosk I was also told to see someone. I stood in line for 30 minutes and was refused a ticket despite having paid for the ticket in advanced on my frequent flyer account on JetBlue site. I had a charge from JetBlue on a previous family trip that I was disputing with my credit card company as fraudulent. Although I had not received notice it appears the credit card company agreed the charges were fraudulent and reversed the charges. Despite selling me a ticket they would not let me get a boarding ticket without paying the fraudulent charges that were in dispute. The shift supervisor said that I could not do anything but pay and that there was no one else to talk to about it. In short I missed my flight and had to rebook on a real carrier later and missed important meeting. Very unprofessional and despicable that they would book a ticket and not honor the transaction with no notice!",-1

The aircraft was clean and spacious, and the flight crew was attentive and helpful. I really appreciated that there was free WiFi and over 30 television networks available for free. I have taken a few other flights with different airlines in the last year, and JetBlue was the only one that I've experienced that included those aspects free of charge. The seating was also more comfortable.",1

The problem happened after arrival (this was a direct flight), the entire plane waited for luggage for 2 hours, no explanations, everyone eventually filed claims of lost luggage. 24 hours later and many attempted calls and still nothing, no updates, nothing.

2017-01-09,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to JFK,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,devoted to customer service,False,  Orlando to new York. We would like to thank Jamila from JetBlue Airways for her outstanding customer service. Our flight from Orlando to Boston got cancelled and thus we got stuck in Orlando with our young daughter. She made every effort possible to accommodate us and to get our family home. Bravo! What an employee devoted to customer service you have.,1
2017-01-04,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LGA to FLL,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4,good inflight service,False,"  Flew Jetblue Airways from LaGuardia to Ft Lauderdale. On time. Very efficient. Good inflight service. Highly recommend. Very pleased with the whole experience. I'm on the flight now and felt compelled to write since I was so satisfied. It seems JetBlue thinks about all their processes and ways to be most efficient and customer-service oriented. For example, they take your drink order and bring the drinks instead of blocking the whole aisle with a drink cart. Smart.",1

After delaying the flight for 3.5 hours and switching everyone from one plane to the other 3 times, they decided to cancel the flight. All the ""help"" we got from the people there was to let us know that the way to proceed was calling the 1-800-jet-blue so they can try to put us on other flights.

Was excited about their new Reno to jfk flight but after this trip I'll do everything I can to avoid them again. Their mobile boarding pass didn't register my seat number, and the gate agent got involved and ended up pulling me off the plane because he couldn't find me on the roster. Turns out he was searching for me by first name instead of last! So I missed the flight and spent the day in JFK airport.  And top it off they did nothing for a refund, no food voucher, not even an apology! Pathetic customer service.",-1

Flight from Reno to Long Beach was 2 hours late, checked the city it departed from and there were no weather or other extreme delays on that end, so what gives? Also had to go back to the ticket counter twice because the boarding passes they printed the first time wouldn't scan at security. Friendly enough employees but they will nickel and dime you for everything, be prepared before you get on the plane. I really would of preferred to pay a few more dollars and book with an airline that wouldn't make me multiple hours late for work for no reason, but I didn't book this trip.",-1
2016-11-27,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to LGA,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5,a great example of cheap and cheerful,False,"  Jetblue is a great example of ""cheap and cheerful"". OK, it was really a short round trip between Boston and New York (40 to 45 minutes each way), but from experience, this does not mean unpleasant surprises can't happen. The flight out was a new route to LaGuardia so the passengers even got a free morning snack (bagel with some jam). Unlike most airlines, Jetblue did not threaten people forcing them to surrender their cabin baggage, but instead asked for a specific number of volunteers. Our flight back was at 11pm, but we arrived earlier, and it turns out that Jetblue can try to put you on an earlier flight for free (if it's just one flight earlier). They managed to fit us on a flight one hour earlier. Both flights were on time despite going between very busy airports, and since the allotted time takes into consideration possible delays, we arrived earlier than scheduled in both times. The best part is how organized Jetblue flights are. From a boarding procedure that, like in APAC, fills the back rows first so that long queues don't get stuck behind, to the way they distribute drinks (ask first, then only bring what's needed instead of pushing the trolley for half an hour).",1

Jetblue's A320 has the most comfortable seating in economy that I have been in and at 6' 4"" and 300 pounds that is a very positive thing. Unfortunately, that is about the only positive. Fares were reasonable but the absurd $55 for two bags and $20 for one is a pure ripoff. They provided nothing except soft drinks/juice on the flight, the snacks were tiny and even the overpriced food they were pushing looked like something out of a nightmare. It seems to me that with fuel prices half what they were a couple of years ago, completely booked flights and charging for every amenity they could be a bit more generous. In contrast, an Avianca flight from Panama City, Panama to San Jose earlier in the day had a perfectly acceptable breakfast snack with quality products and no baggage fees. Outdone by a Colombian airline.",1
2016-11-13,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FLL to CLE,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,4,they just lost my business,False,"  Fort Lauderdale to Cleveland. One of my group didn't have a seat assignment on their ticket. We went up to the check in desk to address this issue. Once there, a gentleman on the same flight was waiting for assistance but there was no one at the desk. However, there was an employee standing at the front of the entry line deep in conversation with a woman in a wheelchair. We waited patiently for someone to come and take care of the man in front of us as well as ourselves. Five minutes passed with no one attending the desk. One of the pilots came over so he could board the plane. He received no assistance. After waiting a few minutes. He walked up to the agent and proceeded to ask why he wasn't helping the man who was still waiting at the desk. The pilot walked away looking frustrated. The agent proceeded to turn back to his conversation leaving the customer still waiting at the desk. Eventually, the agent started to walk away from the woman he'd been talking to when the husband stepped up and entered the conversation. At that point I walked up to him, excused myself, and ask if there was anyone working the desk. He said yes and I proceeded to ask when they would be coming. He hesitated for a moment before identifying himself as said attendant. He finally asked what my needs were. The man at the attendant station still stood unhelped with a look of aggregation on his face. The agent asked us to wait, saying he'd be right back, as he walked to the desk. We followed behind him just in case he got distracted again. The first customer's frustration grew based on his look of discuss at having been completely overlooked. Fortunately, a second agent showed up to the desk and helped the first guy. I've never seen such poor customer service at an airport in my life. If this is the way JetBlue treats it's customers, they just lost my business.",1
2016-11-09,0.1,Business,Economy Class,JFK to FLL,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,1,they changed my reserved seat,False,"  New York JFK to Ft Lauderdale. I purchased a non refundable ticket in advance and selected a seat (3c) at time of purchase. When checking in and obtaining my boarding pass, they changed my reserved seat to 32c in back of the plane. They had no right to give away my seat as I purchased a nonrefundable ticket. If I wanted to change or cancel my reservation, they would hit me up with the full fare, and if I changed the time or date, they would have charged more. There policy is wrong and unfair. I should have been given the seat I originally reserved. I have choices in the future and will choose an airline a bit more honest than jetblue.",-1

At the airport, the ground crew were excellent. Booked a 'Need more Space' seat. It was comfortable and spacious (row 1). Flight crew was amazing and the luggage came off quickly. Plane was not new, but relatively clean. All TVs functioned well. Free 'Flyfi' was a great bonus! My only complaint might be that the tray table, which came up out of the arm and was hinged in the middle, was bent so it was difficult to put a beverage on and remain confident that it would not end up in my lap.

It honestly does not have to do with the weather. We are sitting in New Orleans airport staring at a weather radar map that is clear for the US. Our flight to New York JFK is delayed for two hours. It is the only flight on the board that is delayed. That's it - JetBlue, you are not worth my money or time anymore, your service is pathetic.",-1

Today September 4th I was traveling as a standby passenger and got booted off after boarding the plane. Due to weight restrictions and excess luggage issues. Another passenger volunteered to exit the plane so that I could make the flight. He did in fact deplane along with his wife and daughter. I was still asked to leave because of luggage problems. I then waited 2 hours for it to be returned to me. Then I was told that one piece of luggage was left back on the plane. So I was asked to deplane because of weight and luggage issues yet my suitcase left without me. Bravo jetblue. You have officially lost a customer.,-1
2016-08-29,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to SLC,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5,simple formula that works very well,False,"  You get what you pay for with Jetblue. Simple formula that works very well. Flew from Orlando to Salt Lake City. Perhaps the age of the plane varies, thus the seat designs change, but overall it’s a predictable formula which I very much appreciate in the US. This was a 4.5 hour flight, so quite long. We paid for extra legroom, which to me makes all the difference. Was worth it. I didn’t eat throughout the flight, but got plenty of water and was on the wifi the whole time which worked very well. For short-haul flights, JetBlue is the way to go.",1

I have even highly recommended them to family and friends. But in the last month I have had nothing but delayed and canceled flights. I'm not sure if it is a management problem but they seem to never be able to keep their schedule. I have flown three times in the last month and all three time I have had over two hour delays, 7/13, 8/5 and now again 8/18. To make it worse they never have a reason. Once I was told it was because of bad weather in Orlando where the plane was coming from but when I checked the weather in Orlando it was perfect with 10% chance of rain. My flight is a 25 minute flight from San Juan to St. Croix and it seems to always be delayed for hours. That just doesn't make sense. I'm waiting 8 times longer than my flight time. It is unacceptable that a company can charge hundreds of dollars for ticket with no responsibility. I recommend not to use JetBlue unless you have to, today I know there are not many better choices.",-1

I could not put my feet under the flight attendant's jump seat because of the wall. Having two tears in my right meniscus, I cannot keep my knees bent at a 90° angle for several hours, but that is precisely what I was forced to do on Jetblue from JFK to LAX on 9 August 2016. I ended up standing for nearly 3 hours of the 5.5 hr. flight. It was a full plane and no other seats were available. My knee swelled up and I spent the last hour and a half of the flight icing it. The ticket agent also prepared two boarding passes with my name on them (giving one to me and the other to my travel friend) which prevented my friends from getting through security and requiring them to go back to the ticket counter for a new boarding pass.

This flight was delayed over 3 hours and this was not communicated in time for passengers to adjust travel plans and even if we could have, a second email encouraged us to arrive on time because Jetblue was ""trying to reduce the delay."" When we got to the gate, it was clear that there was no chance the delay could be reduced. This was not transparent to any of the people on this flight and incredibly disappointing customer service.

After being their two hours the plane became delayed until 1am, as it got later and later the flight kept being pushed back further and further - after sitting at the airport for 10 hours they finally tell us that the plane has arrived and they need to clear etc - no sooner did they tell us that they have decided to cancel the flight. We were given no other information. The jetblue staff refused to help anyone. They made us go back to the check in desk to get on another flight. So after making us sit 10 hrs for a cancelled flight, we were expected to stand in line for another few hours to get a flight. I walked to the front of the line and demanded help. The first lady rude and dismissive, finally I walked over to another lady and I just lost it and had a full on panic attack in front if the whole airport. Finally she got me tickets. There was not a flight until two days later. I was refused any kind of hotel accommodation because it was due to ""weather"".  We had to spend money on taxi services to go back and forth from a relative's apartment that we were staying with. If I hadn't had a relative in the city their only other suggestion would be to sleep on a cot for the next two days in the airport. We were never offered any kind of food or drink voucher.

I chose this airlines because I figured that anything would be better than Spirit but how wrong I was. The flight to Florida went off without a hitch however the flight home was a different story. The flight was delayed by more than 2:45 minutes and of course we were not extended the courtesy of being informed of this as we were checking in baggage. It was only realized as we approached the gate where we encountered hundreds of angry passengers. There was zero communication. We were told to stand in the line containing hundreds of people if we wanted to make other arrangements. Needless to say after standing there for over an hour only to watch the line shorten by 1 person I had had enough. I called the 800 number where I was informed they could book me on the next days flight but they couldn't tell me where, how, or what to do about my luggage. Had they told me upon the time I was checking in my luggage I could have made the decision as to what to do at that moment but to mislead me, take my money, and send me upstairs to what they knew was a nightmare was far more unprofessional.

My flight was supposed to depart 9:40pm flight didn't leave until 11pm. Supposed to land at 5:30am and didn't get there til 7:45am. Plenty of the other people missed there next flight in Boston due to the lack of urgency.,-1
2016-05-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,TPA to DCA,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,rudely interrupted our conversation,False,"  The JetBlue Airport staff after security were the worst I have experienced in all my years of travel. After security we went to our original gate, where we realized it was changed to 11. When we arrived at our new gate boarding already began. As we were walking in, my wife made a humorous comment about the gate change. It was then that one of the JetBlue staff members rudely interrupted our conversation to chime in, ""you know gates do change and you are responsible to know about these changes"". Upon boarding, we were shocked to see that our overhead storage compartment was completely taken. We had paid extra money to receive the ""extra legroom seats"" and we were seated in row 1. It appeared that all of the passengers seated behind us had placed their luggage in the first 6 rows of overhead compartments. I decided to take a seat and wait for everyone to be seated so I could walk to the back of the plane to place my bags, this seemed like the only option being that my wife and I had two carry on bags with absolutely no free compartments in sight. It was here where one of the flight attendants came up to me and said ""sir you cannot have your bags in front of you"". I kindly told her that there was no space in any compartments near me, she said you need to go to the back of the plane and ""find space"". Have paid extra for the ""even more space"" seat and paying to sit in row 1, I was flabbergasted when we asked the flight attendant for a blanket for my pregnant wife and she responded with ""that's $5 dollars, how will you pay?"". It was about 30 minutes into the flight when the flight attendant came through with water and asked what drinks we would like. I requested for a Ginger ale and the flight attendant wrote it down. It was 42 minutes to be exact before I received my wife's drink. I asked the flight attendant twice about the drink. Being that our seats were 1C and 1D, it was literally two steps away from where they store the drinks. They were purposely avoiding getting this drink. Please save yourself money and fly with another airline",-1

More legroom and free Wi-Fi, plus power outlets for every seat. JetBlue's standard legroom is what you get if you upgrade to premium economy on other airlines. Virgin America is close, but tends to be more expensive. Each seat has excellent on-screen entertainment. The food choices are good and reasonable, with unlimited free brand-name snacks.

Check in was a nightmare. First they tried to charge me $20 for each bag we were checking in on the international. When they realized they made a mistake, they told me that my carry on bag was too big so they could charge me $35 for it. Have to make money somehow. Flight was not any better experience. They told me that I cannot put my back pack into the luggage storage area because it was only for passengers with bigger carry on bags, even though that was the only carry on bag we had. Moreover there was no selection of drinks or any food.",-1

2016-04-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,LAX to FLL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not know what customer service means,False,"  JetBlue does not know what customer service means and this was my first and last flight on this airline. On this flight, I was checking in my luggage and I waited for 10 minutes at the drop-your-bag line. I had already checked-in online but I did not have a printed boarding pass. When I arrived at the counter a rude attendant (supervisor) told me I was in the wrong line. He rudely told me that I had to go the end of the main check in line even though I had already checked-in online. I explained to him that I had already waited 10 minutes and pleaded to accommodate me at the drop-your-bag line but he told me it didn't matter and he directed me to go the end of the main line. I refused to go and I asked to speak to the manager. The manager arrived and also rudely told me to do the same thing: to go to the end of the main line. I travel on business regularly and have not been treated by such rude attendants as JetBlue. I was concerned I would miss my flight but the attendants just flippantly said that if I miss the flight I would have to get on a later flight. Fortunately, I purchased the TSA pre-check which expedited my pass through the security gate. I'm very disappointed with this experience and will never fly JetBlue ever again.",-1

2016-04-09,0.1,Business,Business Class,IAD to JFK,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,one of the worst experiences,False,"  Washington Dulles to New York JFK with Jetblue. This was probably one of the worst experiences I had in over 20 years of regular flying. From the beginning till the very end. We experienced a delay due to weather conditions. However, the ground staff was not helpful at all. A lot of us had connecting flights, and we asked that they contact the airlines we were flying with to check the status. They refused. We asked that they give us the telephone numbers of the airline so that we, the passengers, can contact them. They refused. And as the wifi was not working in the terminal, it was difficult to get the numbers. We got it, despite the refusal of the JetBlue staff. We asked to be rerouted to other airlines who were taking off. They refused. We had over 6 hours delay, and as they refused to contact the connecting international airlines, we missed (9 of us) the connection by few minutes. And then, the real nightmare started. In JFK, they were incapable of locating our luggage. It took them hours to tell us that finally, they can't locate it and we need to come back the next day. As there were no seats available on my connecting flight for few days, I needed to get my luggage. And when we were trying to rebook, the people standing at the counters would not take us, as 'they had to be free for first class passengers, in case they came, so they could not serve us'. For a low cost airline, this sounds like a joke. The result was a long queue before one of the counter, and at the other, the woman starring and not accepting any passenger. After 6:30 hours delay and additional 3 hours of trying to figure out what to do, this was a particularly bad experience. The next day, they were incapable of saying where the luggage is. I lost the whole day until I finally got my luggage. I heard all type of excuses: as my luggage was initially checked through to the final destination, it was difficult to locate it (do they know how t use bar codes?), or it was not clear where the luggage was, etc. I finally got my luggage thanks to the assistance from the other airline, who tried to help, as JetBlue was incapable. But they clearly said that this was a JetBlue problem. I also asked JetBlue to give me a confirmation about the delay, so that my insurance can assist me. They refused. They said that my insurance (from Europe) had to call the 0800 number to get a confirmation. But they are not providing a confirmation. I spoke to not less than 4 different people, including the one claiming to be the supervisor, they refused. Throughout the whole nightmare, the one thing that they kept saying consistently was 'I cannot', 'I don't know', 'It is not JetBlue's problem', 'it is not possible'. There was no customer service, no desire to help, no desire to find a solution whatsoever, from pretty much everybody working at this company. The result of all this is: I will never ever fly with JetBlue. They are the worst airline I've used, and the one flight with them will be the very last.",-1
2016-04-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to BOS,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,I couldn't be more uncomfortable,False,"  Las Vegas to Boston with Jetblue. Broken seat back; cushion hard as a rock - I couldn't be more uncomfortable! Stewardess seems to find my discomfort amusing. Two hour delay taking off because JetBlue doesn't know how to allot for luggage weight. I will never voluntarily fly them again, no matter how much more I have to pay to avoid them.",-1
2016-04-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BOS to RDU,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,have to rebook it myself,False,"  On the evening of April 3, I received a notification from JetBlue that the next day's 8.40am flight out of Boston’s Logan Airport had been canceled, 12+ hours in advance. This was perplexing, as I happened to be leaving Boston at the same time as friends flying different airlines — none of their flights were canceled. When I called customer service, I was told that the cancellation was due to weather, and that 'all the other airlines would be canceling their flights in the morning' as well. I was initially told that my only option was to take the next JetBlue flight out of Boston at approx. 1.30pm. I was then told that flight was full, my remaining option was to take a Wednesday flight, staying two additional nights in Boston at my own expense. I asked to be rebooked on another airline, and was told I would have to rebook it myself. I was offered a refund, which the representative later clarified would be only a half refund. I rebooked with American for a flight leaving at 8.00am, a mere 40 minutes ahead of my original JetBlue flight. Surprise, surprise, it left perfectly on time. Unfortunately, my new one-way ticket cost more than my original roundtrip with JetBlue. In situations such as this, JetBlue is unable to provide a comparable level of service as other airlines. They have a practice of preemptively canceling flights, especially those flights which are not full in an effort to control *potential* delays in other parts of the country. If I hadn’t had access to internet in order to rebook immediately, I would likely still be in Boston. It I hadn’t had the available funds to rebook at my own expense, I would still be in Boston without any place to stay. I must add however, that since returning home Jetblue has offered to reimburse me for the entirety of the rebooked ticket.",-1

JetBlue used to me my airline of choice. The planes were clean, the service was great;, the food/snacks were good. On transcontinental. flights there was a good film selection. There was an air of humor and intelligence to the way the material for passengers was written. The plane I and my husband just flew on was dingy. The staff was trying hard, but they seemed to be struggling with their own problems. The food was terrible; no complimentary food for premium economy. And the film selection was dreadful. Really, the tedium of a long flight demands distraction. What a miserable experience. We will not use JetBlue again unless there is absolutely no other option and the trip is necessary.",-1
