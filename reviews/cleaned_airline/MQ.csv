2024-07-27,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,4,Overall it was pretty good,False,"   There was no problems, everything was good except a 30 minute delay. The seat was ok the, legroom was decent, but the cabin was a little dirty. The crew was nice. Overall it was pretty good.",1
2023-08-17,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Greensboro,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3.0,3,The delay is just crazy,False,"  The delay is just crazy! The first thing related to Heavy rain and little storm, its still reasonable for the delay at that time for around 1.5 hrs. And then, they allows us to boarding and waits for 45 minutes in the airplane after the door closed. Next, I think due to queue in the taxy way, we just being round and around the airport for 1 hour. And they decided to back to gates because need to refuel the airplane. Took around 45 minutes, and the passenger allowed to go out to have a quick drink, or to bathroom while refueling. After that due one passenger decided to leave, all the passengers need to leave the airplane and re-boarding again and wait for like 10 minutes again in the terminal. After that, we fly to GSO normally. Well, maybe the story a little bit doesn't make sense, but that's happening",1
2023-08-07,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Palm Springs,4.0,,5.0,,,3.0,3,need to have overflow staff,True,"  The first leg of my trip on the American Eagle from Palm Springs, ca to Phoenix, Az flight was on time with no issue, but, my return from Phoenix to Palm Springs, ca, that was supposed to leave at 5:35 pm was continually being updated on the screen and did not leave until after around 9pm.. a little over an hour before we boarded, I visited the American Airlines customer service office next to our boarding location, I was told that American Eagle was not American Airlines etc and she looked on her computer screen and then told me some story about not knowing exactly what the delay was, possibly birds flying into an engine delayed crew members from arriving (but the plane was there and the pilots were already there walking around waiting to board the plane to go to Palm Springs, as well). Anyway, two flight attendants showed up and we were able to board. I asked one of the attendants (who was very helpful and courteous) if she had been flown in to work the flight (I thought what the woman said earlier might have been valid and that the crew that might have been on a plane that dealt with birds flying into the engine, caught a different flight to attend to the plane in Phoenix) but she said there were two no-call no-shows and she and the other attendant were called in to work that flight. Thank goodness those two women showed up or who knows how long it would have taken for us to get out of that airport. I know we cannot blame the entire airline for irresponsible crew members, but there is obviously something going on there. Maybe they need to have overflow staff to assure flights are not delayed due to staff members not showing up.",-1
2023-06-04,1.0,Family Leisure,First Class,Chicago to Atlanta,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4,Very great experience,True,"  Very great experience. Will 100% fly again. Comfort was great, loved the free food and snacks. Also crew was very nice and always tried to help me whenever I needed help.",1
2023-02-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Scranton to Charlotte,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,learn how to treat passengers,False,  Before even getting on the flight the staff was rude and said we have to valet our roller bag and said they don't care if we miss our connecting flight that we have no choice and you have to deal with it. When we get to Charlotte we are instructed to wait on the right hand side of the bridge to get our bags. We do just that. We are then yelled at multiple times to move from the ground crew even though we did exactly what they instructed us to do. Needless to say they need to work on their customer service and learn how to treat passengers.,-1
2023-01-19,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Syracuse,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,It’s like an expensive bus ride,False,  Honestly American Airlines has to do much better. These carriers they use for smaller cities are tiny and full to capacity. There’s barely any room to move. Why in the world when I am booking American Airlines am I being assigned this carrier? I think this information should be better disclosed to passengers when they are purchasing their flights. The plane smelt like pee and we were delayed by over 15 minutes without any explanation. It’s like an expensive bus ride to upstate NY without any damn amenities. So long as they continue to utilize this carrier for the the airport I live near to I won’t be booking any flights with with them.,-1
2022-09-16,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,El Paso to Los Angeles,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,5.0,3,"personable, efficient, and highly competent",False,"  I want to strongly recommend the Disabled Persons Services employee, Kevin, who helped transport me across three terminals at LAX this week. He is personable, efficient, and highly competent at his job. We really needed someone like him that morning.",1
2022-05-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to Charlotte,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolute garbage,True," Absolute garbage. Boarded the plane only to be told to get off, Cancelled our flight and didn’t even inform us, refused to talk to customers at the kiosk, then informs us that they can’t get us to our final destination of San Francisco (one of the larges cities on the West Coast) until 36hrs after we are supposed to arrive. Lost AB&B, lost car reservation with car seat (that they aren’t going refund us for), and now we’re have to make up 2 days of travel hurrying to a wedding in Oregon, losing the time we were gonna spend driving the PCH (which is half of our trip). Please for the love of God choose a different airline.",-1
2022-04-14,0.6,Business,First Class,Sarasota to Charlotte,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,4,unfortunately not wonderful,False,"  Our American Eagle Flight from SRQ to Charlotte (flt. 5521 departing SRQ at 1:30 pm on April 13) was unfortunately not wonderful. The flight attendant for business was curt, draconian in approach, and very stingy with snacks. I have flown this route numerous times and when I have asked for more than one item it was gladly given - .not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant, and even then, when she returned and I watched her stow the leftover snacks and I asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part. The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities. Please understand that I don't like giving negative information nor do I wish to complain. These are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them. But my attitude is always positive and welcoming and I expect no less than those whose service I have procured - and this was clearly substandard.",-1
2022-03-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Cincinatti,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,last time I fly this airline,True,"  Do not fly American Eagle. I flew on flight 6002 March 11,2022 from Montgomery to Charlotte. This was the worst flight ever. Their customer service is ridiculous. We landed in Spartanburg NC for a reason that no one knew. We were held on the plane for 4 hours waiting plus the 5:30am flight which was 50 minutes. The entire flight lost their connection flights and had to suffer the long day at the air port because no one knew how to connect a flight to another flight. We weren’t given any options. Nothing to help us get through. Some customers had medical Conditions that required eating before medication and nothing. As we were waiting the toilets got stuffed up and couldn’t flush any more. The seats we sat in basically had no support in the middle and sagged down the center. It was painful sitting and waiting. All in all this will be the last time I fly this airline.",-1
2022-02-24,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Roanoke,5.0,,3.0,,,5.0,2,try to avoid American in the future,True,"  Booked this round trip around 3 weeks in advance. Was rather expensive and I felt tricked into paying to reserve my seat at the time of booking. I found out subsequently that reserving was free within 24hrs of the flight. I felt it was mean of the airline to charge for 1 checked bag. I have flown many times with various European, Asian and US airlines in the past 40 years and this is the first time I have incurred these charges on top of what I believe to have been an expensive flight in the first place. The staff encountered as well as the flights themselves were no better or worse than the competition. I will try to avoid American in the future!",-1
2021-11-11,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Raleigh,3.0,,1.0,,,4.0,1,that’s not the way you speak to a customer,False,  I’m on the plane as we speak making a review because the flight attendant is very rude. I’m on flight 5216 to RDU from Philly. First off let me start off with my families original flight was canceled and we had to wait 14hrs in the airport for another flight. We should of been given more than $12 food vouchers for 14 hrs. Then for us to get on a plane where the attendant has an attitude for what reason we don’t know. He asked me was I willing to help with an emergency because I have an end seat. I shook my head yes and aggressively he says you need to say yes or no. Excuse me! He could have said that a little better. Then I was looking at him and he asked me did I have a problem? Really? I have a problem because I looked at him? I just laughed and my husband said something to him and he walked away. Better customer service training needed because that’s not the way you speak to a customer.,-1
2021-10-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas Fort-Worth to Shreveport,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,The flight attendants were the worst!,True," Absolutely horrible! The flight attendants were the worst! They made me wear a different mask because apparently there was something wrong with my mask, even though I passed through security and had just got off a previous plane without anybody making me switch masks! As soon as I sat down, she told the other attendant to make sure I was wearing the new mask. Then they continued to target me on the plane by telling me my pillow needs to be stored under the seat, which is a lie! No airplane carrier makes you do that. Then the older lady told me to put my phone on airplane mode as I was finishing a text. I told her to give me one second and I will put it on there, but then she yelled at me saying, “Now! Put it on airplane mode now!” So I did. Then the same lady came back a minute later to harass me again and said “I need your phone on airplane mode.” I told her that I did the first time she asked and showed her the airplane symbol on my phone. Then she got an attitude and left. I will never fly with this airline again.",-1
2021-08-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Milwaukee,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,American Airlines. It's a clown show!,True," 
Jay L. Schottenstein makes $14.7 million/yr then pays his top 5 another $21million to pick you up 6 hrs late in an outdated plane that offers no snacks, drinks, ice and only enough warm water for 1/2 the passengers, oh and no wifi. Only to leave you stranded for 17 + hrs and offer no hotel room or meal vouchers. Then pays nice people poor wages to say sorry through a smile. Tells you it's due to weather only to find out from the pilot it's mechanical. American Airlines. It's a clown show!",-1
2021-05-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The cabins are so small and they are filling every seat,False,"  I would not recommend ever flying this airline. The cabins are so small and they are filling every seat. The flight is packed. It seems their response to our safety during COVID is to pack the small planes where everyone but do not provide any inflight food or beverage service. I flew Delta 2 days ago, what a difference. Every other seat was open. I felt very safe from others who may have the virus and they were great at providing safe food and beverage service. I can't believe the difference in these two airlines. Especially when the price of the flights were exactly the same. I would never choose to fly American Eagle again.",-1
2021-03-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chartlotte to New Bern,3.0,,1.0,,,3.0,3,Sensitivity training. Invest in it,True," I am usually not one to take the time to complete reviews or even the one to care about leaving a review. However this time I felt compelled. I was recently a passenger on a flight from Charlotte to New Bern, North Carolina. It had been a weekend. I was boarding the plane. With two bags strategically positioned but still somewhat awkwardly, on my person making my way to my seat. I was wearing new platform sneakers I treated myself to. It had been a year. I think we can all relate. The person in front of me stopped in his tracks to snatch up a spot to place his item in the “overhead bin”. So I had to stop mid step and took a step back. Of course, this happened to be right in front of someone of your staff sitting in one of the rows. He looked at me and said “too much to drink?” I felt instantly embarrassed. Because he wasn’t quiet and discreet. “No sir” I said. but thank you. What I wanted to say was, I did have a glass of wine prior to boarding. But thank you for assuming that I was drunk. Not that I’ve spent a last minute whirlwind weekend with my family in Massachusetts, after 14 months of not seeing them due to Covid. Not seeing my father with kidney failure for fear of bringing the pandemic to his door step, as I am a primary care nurse practitioner. It wasn’t the weight of a weekend spent desperately making up for lost time and salvaging moments. Not being exhausted staying up with him because he was too afraid to asleep. You don’t know me. I don’t know you. In a world that is already struggling. Be kind. Do not assume the worst. As much as anyone, I know the importance of safety. Ask if I am ok. Or say nothing at all. When I really wanted to answer with, if only it was that simple. I am not sure what your company has identified as core values, but where I work, these interactions would be unacceptable. Sensitivity training. Invest in it.",-1
2021-02-14,0.3,Solo Leisure,First Class,Dallas to South Bend,4.0,2.0,5.0,,3.0,1.0,2,not concerned with even trying to be on time,False,  Flight departed twenty minutes late. Waited forty five minutes to park after landing because we had to wait for the one of nine gates that was occupied to depart. Ground personnel only handle one plane at a time. Obviously this airline is not concerned with even trying to be on time. First class cabin very cold. Cabin crew said they could not help because of a design flaw.,-1
2021-01-20,0.4,Business,Economy Class,Lexington to Philadelphia,1.0,,5.0,,,3.0,5,a mediocre experience,False,"  Let’s start with the bad, that is terminal F and Philadelphia, it just is not a nice place, though the food court is nice! LEX is pretty pleasant however, and every single AA employee I talked to at both airports and on the flight were pretty good! My biggest issue was space. I’m 5’8, and about 175 pounds and I was cramped into the little ERJ. So, overall, a mediocre experience. Also, this flight was a Piedmont Airlines flight, operating as American Eagle!",1
2020-11-29,0.3,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to Ronald Reagan,1.0,,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3,The seat in front of mine was obviously filthy,True," American promises that they keep their planes clean, especially during COVID. The seat in front of mine was obviously filthy and had been for some time. The headrest had a layer of built up dead skin, there was popcorn on the floor, and there was a dirty water mark above my head. None of these obvious things had been cleaned in quite some time. I actually touched the seat in front of me and felt the greasy build up on the headrest. It’s unbelievable that American Airlines would lie about their cleanliness. I have pictures to prove all my claims.",-1
2020-11-19,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mount Pleasant to Charlotte via Fayetteville,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,2,overall service of the airline was excellent,False,  I think the overall service of the airline was excellent. The flight was a bit pricey especially since I had a 6 hour layover for a flight from Charleston to Fayetteville. I also think due to covid the plane should be boarded from the back to the front due to space of the airplane and deboarded from front to back.,1
2020-10-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Wilmington to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,waited over 45 mins for a single passenger to board,True," We boarded on time and then waited over 45 mins for a single passenger to board. The fight is only 30 mins so we sat on the airplane on with masks on for longer than the actual flight for a single passenger, turns out it was an employee in uniform. Not sure why we had to wait considering we paid for this flight and they clearly did not. Probably wouldn't be as annoyed if not sitting for hours on end with this mask on.",-1
2020-10-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Arkansas to Erie,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,No social distancing at all,True, They do not care about covid at all. Packed airplane elbow to elbow and they pretend a mask will help me against the virus. No social distancing at all which is law everywhere else except airlines and Walmart apparently. Put my life at risk over a few extra dollars. Never giving them my money again unless they refund me for the complete disregard for my and the other customers health.,-1

All the flight attendants was possibly the worst I’ve had in my life. Not only was they were rude, but had zero knowledge of their product, and super unprofessional.",-1
2020-03-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Dallas to Springfield,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,cost me hundreds of extra dollars,True," Dallas to Springfield. Initial flight time was 10:30 am, 30 minutes into the flight they decided there was something wrong with the plane so we had to return to Dallas. We were then sent to several different terminals because the workers didn’t realize there is more than one town named Springfield. Finally, after an hour or so a replacement plane arrived, they decided that the plane was also broken. Several hours later we were offered nasty stale sandwiches as an apology for their continued screw ups. We were then able to board the third plane. This plane was randomly picked for the pilots to manually figure the weight of the aircraft. Imagine my surprise when they decided the plane weighed too much. People were kicked off the plane and we had to wait an extra hour and a half to remove some fuel. This garbage airline company cost me hundreds of extra dollars (hotel, rental car, food) because I then missed the following connecting flights and had to stay the night in Missouri.",-1
2020-02-10,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Charlotte to Birmingham–Shuttlesworth,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,terrible Customer experience,False,  Charlotte to Birmingham–Shuttlesworth. PSA an American Eagle operator is killing the American brand. I have been rescheduled twice today on different flight to Birmingham because planes have maintenance issues and all they do is keep moving times out .. both have been knows for hours.. and now they are saying they don’t have the manpower to go get a new plane that is parked at another gate As a concierge key member of American Airlines I just wish the American leadership would start looking at these operators in American Eagle and cancel their contracts due to poor performance and terrible Customer experience. The worst I have seen in my 30 years of flying,-1
2019-12-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Monterey to Providence via Phoenix / Washington,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worse flight experience,True,"  Monterey to Providence via Phoenix / Washington. This was the worse flight experience in my life. Hours of delays, the aircraft was old and seats falling apart. I traveled from Monterey. The plane sat for over 30 mins after boarding. No weather problems. Then there was almost four hours delay in DC. Returning home there was a three hour delay in Phoenix. The toilet lights were not working. The WiFi was working. Everything that could go wrong happened. I will never fly American airlines after my next trip. It's been booked and I can't afford to cancel. I would rate this a zero if I could.",-1
2019-11-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Dallas Ft Worth to Amarillo,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,cancelled flight or a delay,True,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Amarillo. Pretty much done flying American. Every single time it results in a cancelled flight or a delay, and American shows no sense of urgency. They do not care. Not one bit. You cannot make plans when flying American because their planes are so old and things fail when time for take off. Highly suggest using a different airline.",-1
2019-10-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Reagan to Providence,1.0,1.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,Flight was consistently delayed,True, Reagan to Providence with American Eagle. Flight was consistently delayed. Gate changed 2 times. Plane changed to a smaller plane. Was not informed of the smaller plane or that those with tickets in rows not available on the new plane would get bumped. Meal voucher given was declined when I tried to use it. Was not told original flight had mechanical issues and another plane was being used which had room for some of those that were bumped until I overheard other passengers talking about it. Worst experience ever.,-1
2019-10-09,0.2,Business,Business Class,Philadelphia to Wilkes Barre,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,our flight also is delayed for maintenance,True," Philadelphia to Wilkes Barre. While waiting for my flight 2 other flights delayed by American Eagle for maintenance. Then it’s our turn, 10 mins before boarding and our flight also is delayed for maintenance. Sounds to me like someone should take better care of their equipment/aircraft.",-1
2019-09-01,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Angelo Regional to Dallas Fort Worth,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,had consistently poor service,False,"  Had to use American Eagle to get to and from DFW to San Angelo Regional Airport and back or I never would have flown them. I've done this twice in the past year and both trips (a total of 4 flights) provided similar experiences. I have had consistently poor service (or lack thereof). The planes honestly scare me with how many obvious repairs (that don't seem particularly well done) have been done to these ancient airplanes. They seem dirty as well, though that could just be the yellowed plastic from age. The seats are hit or miss depending on how worn out the cushion is. They don't seem to have been replaced since the airplanes were manufactured (probably 20-30 years ago by the looks of them). The planes are small so if you have a standard to large carry on, it will have to be checked in. This is more FYI, since they can't really control the size of the overhead compartments (though they could buy planes made in this decade and solve this issue). The counter was supposed to have staff from 4 am - 7 pm, according to a sign on their counter. There was no one there at all. Keep in mind this small airport has 2 gates and an average of 3 flights a day. I would presume having an employee man the counters for three flights wouldn't be too much to ask, but apparently it is for American Eagle. I can't really comment on their in-flight service since, in all fairness, their flights are usually too short to be able to provide any services. However, I can comment that the pilots do not fly well, and I legitimately thought the plane had crash landed at first when the plane just dropped several meters out of the sky on landing. In the future I will just fly into DFW and drive the 3 hours to San Angelo. I will also never fly American Airlines itself again because of their partnership with this atrocious airline.",-1
2019-08-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Burlington to Grand Rapids,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly American Eagle again,True,"  By far worst flying experience ever. 2 out of four flights cancelled, and one delayed. Our plane leaving grand rapids got up to speed almost off the ground and then came to a screeching halt. The flight was then cancelled due to mechanical issues. I spoke with customer service at the 800 number, the my customer service rep was very rude to me and accused me of being rude because I was displeased my flight would have then been delayed by over 24 hours. I then took a flight the next morning that was delayed as well, and had to fly into Manchester NH over 2.5 hour drive from my home. I will never fly American Eagle again.",-1
2019-08-17,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Green Bay to Chicago,2.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3,hated the strange music,False,  Green Bay to Chicago. Generally good service. What I hated was the strange music we were forced to listen to when we first boarded the plane. Silence would be a perfect option.,1
2019-08-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Providence to Chicago,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,it will be the last time.,True,  Providence to Chicago. First time I flew American Eagle. And it will be the last time. Delayed an hour because of a cabin defect. Overhead compartment door would not closed fully. Was fixed via duct tape. The guy had to go off to get another piece. Also their boarding process is unfriendly.,-1

All the staff is offering is one excuse after another. This airline is holding us hostage. The airline has inefficient maintenance and terrible escalation procedures.

2019-05-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,not respect people’s time,True,  Philadelphia to Cincinnati. American Airlines does not respect people’s time! Or I think they don’t know the importance of time. Ok to be on point I know they always do delays but they hide it until last moment!  I think AA needs some training. Please AA improve your service and taste of cookies served on plane. Crew members are rude and so is customer assistance.,-1
2019-05-02,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangor to Philadelphia,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,2,overbooked that flight,True,"  I went from Bangor to Philadelphia then to Kansas city. And the same route back. My flight was in time which was a relief because of the buses you have to take in Philly to your connecting flight. However on my way back in Kansas city they had over booked the fought by 4 people! Luckily 4 people offered to stay back because they were given 1,000 vouchers once we got to Philly they had overbooked that flight by 2 people and a seat was broken. For whatever reason, my boarding pass didn't have a seat or boarding number on it. This was extremely stressful due to the fact that there are only 2 flights a day that fly into Bangor. 3 people had to stay behind that day. How they get away with one booking. People pay money for these tickets and expect to get to and from their destination in a safe and timely manner.",-1
2019-04-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Beaumont to Billings via Dallas,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,2.0,1,cancelled the connecting flight,True,"  Beaumont to Billings via Dallas. The tickets were ridiculously expensive. The same day I booked, I had to change our flights to the next day. Even though the tickets were still same price for the next day as the ones I purchased, I was charged 150 dollars for the change. Then American Airlines pressured me into buying trip insurance, telling me that it would cover any airline changes and cancellations. As I boarded the plane going home, AA cancelled the connecting flight. When I landed in Dallas, I received text that AA re-booked connecting flight for the next day. Now they don't want to pay for the cancelled and re-booked flight (that I was unable to take & I had to rent a car to drive 6 hours home which cost me over 300 dollars). When they were pressuring me to buy the insurance, they NEVER told me the insurance only kicks in after a 12 hr delay. This delay was overnight. Meaning I originally had an evening connecting flight that was cancelled. So, my children & I were supposed to spend the night in DFW airport Isn't that why I bought trip insurance To cover the costs when this happens I know they cannot control the weather, but they could honor the insurance they pressure their customers to buy and not make ridiculous parameters that hinder customers from receiving relief from the insurance. Furthermore, ridiculous fees AA charges for changing flights (after booking the same day within a few hours) is even more reason why I love Southwest. American Airlines need to take lessons from SWA.

2019-03-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to San Jose,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,the worst customer service,True," Absolutely the worst customer service. Nobody is accountable for anything and has no clue of what is happening. I flew from San Jose to Los Angeles on February 11. I accidentally left my wallet on the aircraft. I got a call saying I left it and should collect it from Lost and Found the next day. When I went to LAX nobody had any clue about where it was. The lady at Lost and Found was not helpful and rude. I spent 4 hours at the airport going from counter to counter. I have a voicemail recording saying they found my wallet and then asking me to pick it up. I even spoke to someone over the phone and confirmed the same. However, in less than 12 hours they lost my wallet while getting it from the gate to lost and found. I made several attempts to reach them but nobody answered the phone. When I called the customer service number, they had no clue of how to handle this issue. I filed a report online, but they didn't even respond to that. It shows how careless the employees are with customers' property. They lost something which they themselves found! In less than 12 hours they couldn't even transport it from the gate to the lost and found department. Pathetic.",-1

I am 6'6 and my brother is 6'4 with a prosthetic leg. Our flight attendant watched us struggle to get to our seats and cram ourselves in for the flight. He walked back and invited us to come sit in first class in 2 open seats and proceeded to make it one of the most enjoyable flights we had been on with outstanding service. We will be back to American in the future!,1

One mechanical problem followed by another, compounded by a breakdown in ground equipment caused a 5 hour delay at our origin. As a result, we missed our connection in Miami despite scheduling a 3 hour layover. This caused a 24 hour delay. As a result we miss at least one day of vacation, a day we have to pay for. The information provided while waiting on the tarmac for almost 3 hours was infrequent and unhelpful. ""Customer service"" was provided only grudgingly with every attempt made to provide minimum assistance.",-1

If you're going to make your passengers slum their ride home, don't upcharge for premium seating. They wont provide even their first names for complaints and when I tried to show my receipt and what my upgrade included, the female flight attendant stormed off. I sat in 4F from MCI to DFW arrived 12/19/18 at 9:04 pm. This is the ghetto of airplanes and service. Bad form, American. I'm seriously thinking of switching to United for my weekly flights.",-1

Nashville to Chicago. My initial flight was an hour and a half late. No reason for the delay was given. I ran through the airport to catch my connecting flight and they refused to let me board with 10 minutes to spare. The plane was still stationary and attached to the gate 25 minutes later. I asked them the soonest they could get me a flight to my destination and they replied curtly. ""4 PM, tomorrow. That's all we can do"".

Worst experience I’ve ever had. Flights cancelled due to maintenance not weather - agents aren’t being told truth to tell us -  either that or they are told to lie to us. Just tell me the truth and I can accept it. But to lie to us is unacceptable. Then no hotel - after we were told we would have a hotel at the location we were laying over in once we get there. 12:30am and we all have to fight to get them to give us a hotel like we were promised since it was a maintenance issue. Today get to airport early, flight cancelled due to maintenance, now setting on a plane waiting for fuel and a restroom that we were told doesn’t work! Now we are told another maintenance issue exists and we are delayed again!  Will never fly American again after my points are used!",-1

Sat on the tarmac while pilot told us weather was bad. Flight cancelled and returned to gate. Rebooked 24 hours later. No one offered meal or hotel.

The plane had only 1 working bathroom which resulted in the aisle being blocked for almost the entire flight. This is unsafe and inconveniet. When I checked in, even though I paid extra for my ticket to be able to have a carry on, they made me check it. I told them I didn't want to because I had medicine in it. They told me to take the meds out and check it. Why did I pay extra for my ticket?",-1

They failed two times to tell me I was standby on the next flight and the next day also. My handicapped friend & I waited five hours to be told that. I could have booked another airline or drove to JFK for my connecting flight on British Airways. I was surprising my daughter for mother's day, flying back with her to Lebanon. Approx $1200 later I am rescheduling until Sept after driving from Michigan to Cleveland so my sister would care for my animals. Terrible, no response from them.",-1
2018-05-10,0.2,Business,Economy Class,College Station to Washington via Dallas,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,2marked decline in reliability,True," College Station to Washington via Dallas. I have flown out of College Station for six years. I have noticed a marked decline in the reliability and on-time performance of the American Eagle flights in the past year or so. I have flown four times in the past couple of months, and each time the flight was delayed at least an hour. Today I scheduled a connection with an extra hour of connection time, but it is not enough. I am going to miss the connection. I fly internationally quite often and have given up trying to fly American Eagle for those trips, because missing the connection is not something you can recover from. The thing I hate the most is the way they say, delayed 20 minutes. Then delayed an hour. Then delayed an hour and 10 minutes. Then delayed two hours. etc. If the delay were at least estimated with a little more accuracy, then a person could make plans. The problem is that the planes are so ancient that there are constant maintenance problems. This airline, like nearly all US carriers, is a mess. It is just terrible. If I had any choice at all about travel, I would not fly American Airlines, but in my town there are very limited options. Unfortunately American Eagle does not give a darn about its quality of service. The ground crew in CLL just shrugs their shoulders. Not their fault.",-1
2018-04-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Dallas,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,2,never fly American Airlines,True, Louisville to Dallas. We arrived at the airport at 416pm because our flight was set to leave at 635 PM. The boarding pass at first was not confirmed at the ticket desk. The staff had to go get a supervisor. He said she could not find it because my flight had been changed to depart at 8pm. Instead of gate 29 we were now 49. We walked to 49. I looked at my phone and at 417pm and got an alert starting the flight would be late. I was already at the ticket desk by then. Then after sitting for two hours next to gate 49 they announced my flight gate had changed to 1. I have a fused foot and if my daughter had not been with me I would not have made that walk with my luggage in time. I will never fly American Airlines or its affiliates ever again.,-1
2017-11-11,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington DC to Toronto, Canada",2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,2,cramped into the shuttle bus,False,"  After the 50 passengers were cramped into the shuttle bus, we were told the pilot requested mechanics to deal with a technical issue and we would have to wait a ""couple of minutes"". 10 min later, with doors closed it was hard to breath. The driver cranked the AC to full blast and opened the doors and now we were freezing. After 30 min standing in a cold, packed bus, we were told we would go back to the terminal. Another 10 min later the issue was solved by an off duty mechanic, and we were lucky to be on our way. In short, it was disrespectful, and a health hazard experience.",-1
2017-11-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Wichita to Cincinnati via Chicago,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,Generally unfriendly service,False,"  This was a top to bottom terrible experience with American Eagle. I usually fly Delta and now know why. This flight was booked for me for business. Generally unfriendly service especially by gate staff that either seem inexperienced or poorly trained. 1 to 1.5 hour delays on O'Hare-Wichita both ways, with a 20 min wait on tarmac at O'Hare from CVG due to no boarding tunnel driver. 3 gate changes at O'Hare within 45 min. Late arrival, arrived at hotel after mignight for AM talk. Coming home, was reassured connection would be no problem, then progressive delays and missed connection. Was told by attendant there would be customer service agent to rebook and arrange hotel, but there was none. Gate staff was grumpy and blithely said no hotel because was weather delay, then I asked her to confirm, she reluctantly called and confirmed it was mechanical. Took 15 min to get hotel voucher 30 min away and told could call for shuttle, called hotel and they said no shuttle and airline ""always does that"". Returned to gate and another 15 for cab voucher, still had to cover tip. Hotel at midnight, rebooked for 8am flight. Meal voucher $7 did not cover meal at airport. Flight itself was average enough, arrived safely. Given option, would not travel on American again.",-1
2017-10-15,0.3,Business,Premium Economy,Albany to Chicago,1.0,2.0,4.0,,,4.0,2,I couldn't pick a seat,False,  Albany to Chicago. This plane is clean and attendants pleasant. But I'm upset with the fact I couldn't pick a seat and I am assigned the last seat 18 that does recline. I have a health issues where I would have never chosen this seat. This plane is small and cramped. For where I'm destined I could have picked my usual airline but was suggested by the IT company that is flying me out to pick this one or another airline. I am sadly disappointed. If I can avoid this airline in the future I will. Seat comfort is zero. The lower part of the back indents in so I am hunched forward in this seat that can't recline.,-1
2017-10-10,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Monroe to Dallas Ft Worth,5.0,1.0,1.0,,,5.0,3,hated their jobs and were lazy,False,"  Monroe to Dallas Ft Worth. I have never in my adult life had the flight attendants be so lazy. They were nice, but when it was time for beverages, they not only left out the part where they tell you what they have, by they requested that everyone keep their order to one drink per person (it came off rude). Then the gal walked through with a box holing the snacks and just put it in front of each passanger to get their own snack and then they came through with the drink cart, once my snack was already almost gone. And then why I was surprised, but they came over the speaker to tell everybody to put their shades down, before we landed, so the plane wouldn't get hot. Never have I ever felt like the flight attendants hated their jobs and were lazy.",1
2017-09-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Toronto,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they allowed overbooking,False,"  Chicago to Toronto, they allowed overbooking - resulted in finding volunteers in current flight to move to next flight and resulted in delaying. I was very surprised by the fact that they allowed overbooking, and they had to find 4 volunteers to move to the next flight. The crew member mentioned that the current flight will not be going anywhere until they find volunteers to move to the next flight. Is this a joke? It's a simple math that if the flight is full, they should not take any more customers, but it happened. Not only this delayed the departure time, they provided no compensation whatsoever for people who waited to meet their schedule; this is outrageous. They are ruthless when it comes to customers being late to board on the flight, and if it's other way around, they want our patience - very frustrating. Another problem was that the flight landed in Cleveland to fuel their gas. This was very upsetting because this implies that they did not fully fuel their gas to get to Toronto. I can't stop myself thinking that they can't do math. This delayed another 2 hours or so, and we finally landed to Toronto at 5:00 pm, instead of 2:31 pm. I have nothing more to say about this airplane other than it's stupid and lazy. Only good thing to talk about is that the flight crew lady on the plane was very nice and tried her best to keep us calm. She needs a raise for covering others' problems.",-1
2017-08-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Montreal to New York JFK,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,check their punctuality!,False,"  Montreal to New York JFK. Please be aware before buying a ticket with this airline, check their punctuality!. This particular flight seems to be almost always delayed by close to 90 minutes. I found out through checking Flightstats that this flight (and apparently many more) in the last 12 consecutive days: - 9 of 12 days has been delayed for more than 90 minutes (up to 184 minutes) - 2 of 12 days was cancelled and only on ONE day out of 12 days actually arrrived at the scheduled time ETA. If your travel or work schedule depends on this, choose another connection. AA does not reemburse bought tickets for their proven inability to comply with ticketed departure and arrival times. I had to buy a second ticket to leave Montreal 3 hours earlier.",-1

Fairly standard flights on American Eagle. The flight crew were OK (with one on PHL-YYZ being particularly friendly) and the Valet service for carry on bags works well. The wonderful thing for me was that these flights were on time (as I had tracked them for several weeks before flying and they were often late). The seats and legroom on these smaller aircraft is quite tight.,1
2017-05-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Miami,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,What a shambles,False,  We are from Australia and flew American Eagle for first time. Never again. We got on the plane in Charleston to fly to Miami after a 2 hour delay. Got to the runway and sat for 30 minutes with nobody telling us anything. Eventually pilot said the plane was too heavy and we needed to return to gate. As there was another plane already there we had to sit on the tarmac for another 20 mins. We eventually got back to the gate where they asked 8 passengers to volunteer to get off. 8 people volunteered and got off. 20 mins later they returned and they started taking fuel off the plane instead. What a shambles. Over 3 hrs late the plane took off. After complaining to American Eagle they offered us a $50 voucher valid for 12 months. I said we live in Australia it's no good to us as we won't be back here for a while. Take it our leave it they said. First time we have flown with American Eagle. Never again. They are a disaster.,-1
2017-05-16,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Charlotte,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,Very disorganized and chaotic ,False,  Toronto to Charlotte. Very disorganized and chaotic at the boarding gate in Toronto. Delayed 90 minutes deleting. Maintenance. No food or what're nearby (Gate A9). Nearest food/refreshment A19. On arrival 15 minute delay at arrival gate - no gate agent. Really? The inability to get the easy things causes me to question the company's ability to execute safely.,-1
2017-01-14,0.1,Business,First Class,LAX to SFO,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,unpleasant all around,False,  Los Angeles to San Francisco. I'm a platinum level member of American Airlines. I travel the SFO to LAX with return flight almost weekly. 2017 they made changes subbing out the short flights to American eagle. American eagle is already inconvenient due to the shuttle bus you have to take from the main terminals. Everything is slow and experience is unpleasant all around. So far this year 4 of 4 flights have had significant mechanical plane failures where I've been delayed up to three hours at a time. Unless AA changes these routes to normal planes in and out of terminal four at LAX they are going to lose a very valuable customer.,-1

2016-06-01,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,CMH to LGA,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4,a vast contrast,False,"  Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",-1
