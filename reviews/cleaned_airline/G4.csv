2024-08-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Knoxville,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,3,I am fully disappointed,False, There was a carry on luggage bag size issue. I really didn't know that the size is not correct (which I'm still not sure) because when I checked it's dimensions on the scale it looks ok but the attendent told me that the size is bigger just by 1-2 inches. However I got charged twice for one luggage and the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE failed to refund me. They were just telling their terms and conditions bla bla. I am fully disappointed.,-1
2024-08-13,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newburgh to Punta Gorda,,,,,,3.0,3,"flight was canceled"" ",False,"   After delaying our 6:20 flight three times, we got to the airport and received a text that the flight was canceled and rescheduled for 2:30 the following afternoon. They offered us $175 back plus a $100 flight voucher. Does not cover the hundreds of dollars lost for a car rental and Airbnb for the night plus missing an entire day of our vacation.",-1
2024-08-12,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to St. Pete Clearwater,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,helped me when I got sick,False,"  Linda from Allegiant flight 2598 on August 8th, 2024 at 7:11 pm, was great. She helped me when I got sick on the way to Florida from Syracuse. I was so sick and she gave me a trash bag and took care of it. And no judgement.",1
2024-08-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Washington,,,,,,1.0,1,disappointing and outrageous,False,"  On August 4, 2024, I was scheduled to return home to Virginia from Austin, Texas, on Allegiant Air flight 1516. Since it was a 2:34 PM flight, I arrived at the airport with my two daughters and my 78-year-old mother two hours early to check in and wait. Starting around 1:40 PM, boarding was repeatedly delayed due to various issues, and eventually, we were informed that the plane needed to fly to Houston for refueling. (Delays due to refueling are a very frequent occurrence with this airline!) Since my children had their school orientation the next day, it was crucial for us to get home. Despite several delay announcements, we waited at the airport for over 7 hours before being told that the flight was canceled due to weather. The weather in Austin at the time of departure was clear, and there were no issues at the destination. We were told it was due to Tropical Storm Debbie, but I learned that if the flight had departed on time, it would have been unaffected. The airline’s response was disappointing and outrageous. The ground staff shirked responsibility, directing us to call the service center to reschedule or request a refund, offering only a flight on Thursday or a refund. After 7 hours of waiting and growing frustration, I protested but was threatened with being removed from the airport by security, seemingly because of my Asian descent. We were eventually forced to leave the airport and had to contact relatives in Austin to pick us up. Desperate to get home, I persisted in contacting the service center. After three lengthy calls and an hour-and-a-half wait, I finally spoke with a representative who offered the same irresponsible options I had faced at the airport: “The earliest flight is on Sunday, or we can offer a full refund.” Are you saying the next available flight is on Sunday, August 11th? What about the additional lodging and travel expenses? Am I expected to cancel a flight I booked months in advance at a low price and find a last-minute, expensive one-way ticket? This is unreasonable. I demanded the quickest option to get close to home and refused to hang up. As a result, I was offered a flight to Pittsburgh at 6:30 AM the next day. I accepted and rented a car to drive approximately 190 miles home. Due to the airline’s refusal to take responsibility, I endured two days of delays and confusion at the airport and incurred additional costs, including $500 for the rental car.",-1
2024-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minot to Florida,,,,,,,1,extremely disappointing experience,False,"  I had an extremely disappointing experience with Allegiant Air that felt nothing short of a scam. My flight 1233 from Minot International (MOT) to Orlando Sanford International (SFB), scheduled to depart on Monday, 05 August 2024 at 5:43 PM, was delayed to 12:30 PM on Tuesday, 06 August 2024. This last-minute rescheduling caused me significant financial loss and inconvenience. As a self-employed professional, I rely on timely travel to manage my business commitments. The delay resulted in a full day’s lost earnings and additional expenses for accommodation, meals, and transportation. Despite their claims of prioritizing passenger safety, Allegiant Air showed no regard for the financial and personal impact their delays cause. To make matters worse, when I reached out to Allegiant for compensation, their response was dismissive and inadequate. This level of customer neglect and mismanagement is unacceptable, and I feel cheated by their false promises.  I will certainly be taking my business elsewhere and advise others to do the same.",-1
2024-06-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lexington to St. Petersburg,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,"Delayed 3 hours"" ",True,"   Delayed 3 hours to get another plane. Overbooked flight while they begged for passengers to voluntarily reschedule. Landed at 7:54 pm should have been 4:47pm. After we landed it was lightning so when we were cleared there was no one to taxi in plane  By the time they got someone it was lightening again  So now currently still sitting here for an hour and a half on the runway. They said if we sit for 30 more minutes we get complimentary water and pretzels. I don’t want, I want off this plane.",-1
2024-06-23,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Wayne to Sarasota,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,make their phone hold times less?,False,"   Seriously, with the technical advances we have, they can't figure out how to make their phone hold times less? They can't figure out the logistics of seat assignments for different planes? They can't make refunds automatic when they have to change seats for their customers. I paid for front row seats months in advance and they can't refund me without a 45 minute hold time when they took those seats away? It's worth more money to fly another airline than to deal with their service.",-1
2024-06-18,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Rickenbacker,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,overall experience was satisfactory,True,"  During our recent flight from Myrtle Beach to Rickenbacker, the overall experience was satisfactory. The flight proceeded smoothly, with a seamless takeoff, landing, and minimal turbulence. Onboard, we had a team of four flight attendants, three of whom carried out their duties effectively. However, one of the attendants exhibited concerning behavior. She displayed signs that suggested she may have been under the influence of some substance, as her actions appeared erratic and unusual. Additionally, we overheard her speaking in a sharp tone, expressing frustration regarding passengers fastening their seat belts and storing their luggage. Throughout the duration of the flight, she maintained a displeased expression, causing several passengers to comment on her apparent state.",-1
2024-06-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Orlando,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,just lost our future business,True,"  After a 5 hour delay and it may end up being longer, you just lost our future business. This has happened too many times. So many children here waiting to go to Disney and not one restaurant is open for them. What a rude, inconsiderate way to run an airline. Several here just experienced this same delay last Thursday. We have to call off work tomorrow because of this. You have no pilot even. Make this right to your customers.",-1
2024-06-16,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Wayne to Phoenix/Mesa,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1,"return flight was was canceled"" ",False,"   I fly into Fort Wayne, Indiana fine and on time. Apart from cramped seats the flight was acceptable. The departture flight was good. The return flight was was canceled less than 24 hours before departure. I needed to return by Monday and this was Sunday. Allegiant Air gave me a refund but not enough to pay for a last-minute flight on another airline. I was not happy. I was shocked as this never happened before.",-1
2024-06-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rockford to Mesa,2.0,,1.0,,,5.0,2,first complaint I've ever had,True,"  I paid in advance for a window seat, but it was going to be on the side of the plane in the sun. I wanted to sit on the shaded side so I went into the app and changed it about 2 1/2 hours before my flight. I changed to the very last row on the opposite side. I also paid for priority boarding so I could board quicker, and once I got back to my seat I noticed there was no window at all. There were 2 flight attendants in the back and I told them I wanted a window seat and asked if they could keep me posted as to whether one came available. I was originally going to be in seat 30A and changed to 32F. The seating chart showed one person in that row in the middle seat. All 3 of the seats in row 30 were empty until one young man came and sat in the original window seat I had until 2 1/2 hours earlier (30A). I would have been happy with any window seat at that time and I knew he was sitting in the wrong seat because he saw there was no one in the window so he moved over. I asked one of the flight attendants if she could just check with him to see if he was in the right seat. She said very rudely, that if they could accommodate they would, but she wasn't going to check everyone's tickets to be sure they were in the right seat. I told her that's not what I said or what I was asking. I told her I'm a bit claustrophobic and really wanted a window. She asked if someone had sat in my original seat, or how it was that I managed to get the one I was in. I tried to explain all of the above to her, but she just repeated she wasn't going to check everyone's ticket and they would let me know if there was another window available. I was just going to stay where I was at, but the other attendant found an empty window for me. I just got moved and then we had to de-plane for some issue, but that's unrelated. So, yes, I changed seats at the last minute. No, I didn't know there was no window in the very back. I simply asked if she could verify the seat if the gentleman in 30A, to be sure that's his correct seat. She said that if it wasn't, the person assigned to that seat would come and he'd have to move anyways. I have flown Allegiant for years and I've been their biggest advocate. Anytime someone turns to up their nose when I mention flying Allegiant, I have always said that I've never had any problems. This is the first complaint I've ever had. I've worked in customer service my entire life, and I know what good customer service is and this isn't it. This may sound very trivial, but it means something to me. I don't need this sarcasm when I've paid money to fly this airline. Asking to verify one person's seat is not asking too much. Just a note: all of the other crew members and airport staff were wonderful.",1
2024-06-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Peoria,1.0,1.0,5.0,,,2.0,2,staff is always kind and helpful,True,"  Allegiant is convenient when you like to avoid the larger, busy airports. The staff is always kind and helpful. That’s about the best I can say about Allegiant. The planes are so crowded due to the cheap fares that you are shoe horned into the seats. If you are sitting next to an average size American you probably won’t rest at all due to bumping into your fellow passengers in the adjacent seats. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, and leg room is minimal at best. There is no in flight entertainment other than people watching and the sounds of unhappy young children crying or screaming. My flight today was delayed. I was notified of the delay via email and text 2:15 hours beforehand, just as I arrived at the airport and had checked in my rental car. I had my family of 5 in tow and we ended up having to Uber back to our hotel who graciously allowed us to have our room back until 7 hours later when we had to head back to the airport. We were given meal vouchers which was a nice gesture, but I think transportation reimbursement would have been reasonable as I would not keep my family at the airport all day long.",-1
2024-06-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,Idaho Falls to Mesa Arizona,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,“very disappointed and dissatisfied”,True," When we first got to the IF airport, we were charged an extra 150 dollars to check our bags, and the man helping us said that our carry on is the right size and we wouldn’t have to pay for it. We then were boarding our flight, and the lady looked at us and said our bag was too big to be a carry on. She was very blunt and rude, and we asked about the other bags people were bringing in that were the same size. She said to put our bag on the measuring box to see, and when it went about an inch over she looked down on us. We then had to pay another 75 dollars for this carry on. She was not kind to us at all, not talking to us like real people. I’m very disappointed and dissatisfied with how she treated me and my 2 cousins, nobody should be talked down to that way.",-1
2024-06-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Destin to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Nickel and dime you to death,True,  Wish I could give a zero. Do yourself a favor travel with anyone but them. It won’t save you money because they will charge you carry on prices for your personal items. Nickel and dime you to death. Then lose your luggage. Not just one persons luggage lost…our entire planes luggage was lost for almost two hours to the point the police had to be dispatched. I will walk to Florida before I fly this airline again.,-1
2024-06-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3,Do not recommend this airline,True,"  There were over 20 infants on my flight and they screamed the entire flight, I didn’t pay for someone to bring their kids because it’s free to fly with a child under 2 so people inconvenience people with constant screaming. Do not recommend this airline.",-1
2024-05-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Providence, RI to Punta Gorda, FL",3.0,,1.0,,,3.0,3,"“claim to be pet friendly, but it was not”",False," Allegiant is very popular in my town as the only airline at our small airport. Direct flights into other small airports. It is well known that it's a no frills type of service. I have flown with them prior, and had no issues. But this time I traveled due to an ailing friend who died during my visit. I decided last minute that I couldn't let her cat go to a shelter. So we put her in an approved carrier and I paid to bring her home. She's a quiet gentle kitty, but was meowing as we boarded the loud plane. Though I hardly knew the cat, she had been quiet, only making noise when being moved around. So when the stewardess came to me and threatened to have me kicked off the plane if I didn't get her quieted immediately, I was shocked and dismayed. Already distraught over losing a friend, and now wondering and hoping I can make new kitty's presence work in my home, I sure didn't need someone making impossible demands. I had never flown with an animal like that. Some, more sympathetic passengers, offered advice of tranquilizers, etc. But I was in the pickle NOW. I really didn't want to miss this flight! They moved the passenger in front of me. But kitty quieted once we took off and hardly made a peep the rest of the flight. I was in tears off and on during the 2 hour flight, realizing this cat was all I had left of my friend. It made it difficult to communicate with passengers, or the crew. I realize that's a personal problem, but a real part of my experience, here. It is the next day, and I still feel traumatized by the whole ordeal. I wish they were more specific about pet travel in their policy explanation. I really had no clue that a generally quiet, but a temporarily meowing cat was reason to be removed from a plane! I have traveled with children and babies screaming, but never heard anyone suggest drugs to shut them up, and never a threat to kick them off! I will likely use Allegiant again because of the convenience. But I just want to forewarn others who might be considering taking a pet. They claim to be pet friendly, but it was not my experience.",1
2024-05-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Petersburg to Indianapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Nothing good about it,True, This is the first and last time flying this horrible airline. Nothing good about it. Prepare to pay as much for carry on bags as you do for the ticket.,-1
2024-05-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Knoxville,,,,,,,1,biggest mistake ever,False,"   I'm a 100% disabled vet. Before my flight I had a medical emergency which I was hospitalized, which caused me to miss my flight. 45 mins on hold the day before flight, was told they couldn't do anything for me. Then was told to call back and use different numbers to get someone else. Just to be told same thing, only this time was told to go to website and email customer care. Just to be told there was nothing they could do for me or my family. So 2k later and no flight. This was my first and last time ever flying with this company. Had a similar issues like this with southwest and they were more then helpful. Wish I read a lot of these reviews before choosing to fly with this airline .. biggest mistake ever.",-1
2024-05-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Portland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,an absolute nightmare,True,"  I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying with Allegiant Airlines, and it was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment we arrived at the airport, it was clear that this was going to be a disastrous journey. Despite arriving more than two hours early for our flight, there were no staff members at the ticketing counter, and the line was outrageously long, stretching out the door. In a panic, we tried calling Allegiant's customer care line for assistance, only to be met with rude and hostile customer service representatives who seemed more interested in blaming us for the situation rather than helping. It was abundantly clear that the fault lay squarely with the airline for not having enough staff to handle the volume of passengers. After what felt like an eternity of waiting, we were finally able to speak with a supervisor, who was perhaps the most rude and dismissive person we encountered throughout this ordeal. Despite our pleas for assistance, he callously informed us that the next available flight wouldn't be for another five days, leaving us stranded at the airport with our 5-month-old baby and all of our belongings, including our car seat and stroller, which were already on the plane. To add insult to injury, Allegiant initially claimed that they had loaner car seats and strollers available to help alleviate our situation. However, when we asked for them, suddenly they had nothing of the sort, leaving us completely helpless and at their mercy. In summary, our experience with Allegiant Airlines was an absolute nightmare. From the lack of staff at the ticketing counter to the abysmal customer service and the complete disregard for our well-being as passengers, it was by far the worst travel experience we have ever endured. I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with Allegiant to think twice and explore other options, unless they enjoy being treated with disrespect and left stranded at the airport",-1
2024-05-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rickenbacker to Destin,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,never been treated so badly,True,  When i arrived at the airport they were not yet checking in my flight. I was about the 7th person in line. They said it would be at least 45 min before they started my flights check in. I couldn't stand that long so i went to the restroom and then outside to find a place to sit. By the time they opened check in the line was horribly long. There was only one person at the desk checking in an entire plane full of people and the line stretched past security for well over an hour. As a disabled person that marked on her reservation that i was in need of a wheelchair i attempted to use the priority check in lane because i am unable to stand for long periods of time without extreme pain. Even though there is a handicap sign on the priority check in lane i was told that because i don't have your credit card i would have to wait in the excessive line. I explained that i needed a wheel chair and was told that i could grab one myself and someone would come around to help me. I pointed out the handicap symbol on the priority sign and was told that i couldn't just skip the line (but apparently that's OK if i have your credit card? ). I sat in a wheelchair and moved myself through the long check in line as no one came to help me. I finally made it to the desk to check the bag i prepaid for and asked if someone was finally coming to help me get to the gate and was told to wheel myself to the side and just wait. They finished checking everyone in before taking me to the gate. The flight was delayed and i was the last person on the plane. I fly often and have never been treated so badly. No disabled passenger should be forced to stand in pain because they don't have your credit card. This is my first time flying your airline because it was the best option to get down to Destin but if i hadn't booked a round trip ticket it would have been the only flight i ever took with you.,-1
2024-05-05,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Tulsa,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,Great experience,False,"   Great experience, no delays, great service, flight team member performed magic acts for passengers. I saw no issues with free carry on pieces with other passengers. Friendly service.",1
2024-04-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Providence to Punta Gorda,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“was told I had to move”,True, Paid for a seat and was told I had to move to accommodate a mother/daughter who did not pay for their seats. I was told loudly that I would have to move or continue to be petty and leave the plane. I’ve read reviews here that have reported the same senerio. Evidently this is an accepted practice within this airline and goes against their written advertisement where they encourage you to pay for your seat to “ guarantee your comfort and location onboard your flight”.,1
2024-04-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Jacksonville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,reps were rude to me and overreaching,False,"   I was very excited about the flight to Jacksonville to meet my first grandchild who was born on Tuesday, April 16. When I came up to the counter, probably to read the signs, A lady asked me if I was flying Allegiant, and where I was going. I told her that I was going to Jacksonville, and she said she was going there too. She said that she was from Afghanistan, and her English wasn't the best. She asked me if I would help her. I was happy to help since we were going to the same place, even though my plan was to hang out at the USO eating chips and drinking soda as I am a veteran's spouse. We both sat down until the counter reps came out and the line began to form. I checked in online before getting to the airport, so I checked my bag first. Then I stepped over to help the passenger from Afghanistan. While we were in line, I asked her if she had her boarding pass, and she only showed me her reservation, and I saw that she hadn't checked in yet. So, I tried to walk her through the steps to checkin online on her phone like I did. This took a while because I tried to explain step by step, and there were a lot of steps involved to check in. The check-in was interrupted when it was my turn at the counter. So we had to start over. The check-in was interrupted again when she got a phone call. So we had to start over again. It was very important for her to check in online to avoid the $75 charge for the 2nd bag she wanted to check. She preferred to pay the lower charge, $30, offered online. I tried explaining this to the Allegiant counter reps hoping that they would somehow make an exception, save her the trouble, and just let her pay the $30 at the counter. Instead of making an exception, they began questioning me and asking the passenger from Afghanistan about me. She told them several times that I was there to help. The counter reps were rude to me and overreaching. They reported me to security! The reps lied, reporting to security that I wouldn't allow her to talk to them. The passenger I helped spoke to the counter reps the whole time. I was just standing there to help and repeatedly trying to walk her through the check-in process on her phone. One of the reps tried to force me to render my boarding pass and ID unnecessarily. The passenger I helped explained several times that I was helping her. She apologized to me, the security officer who questioned me also apologized to me, however, the counter reps continued their weird behavior, taking pictures of me, and writing notes about me when I boarded the plane. It was unbelievable! I asked the passenger a couple of times if she still needed my help, and she said yes, so I stayed, since I said I would help. I was relieved when the counter reps finally checked her bags even though they did so by taking her phone and forcing her to download the app and on top of that also forced her to pay $5 for the boarding pass... I would think that she could access the boarding pass through the app. Anyways, I felt very uncomfortable and undervalued as a customer. I felt falsely accused of something I didn't do. It's still hard to believe, and it hurts a bit to be treated like a criminal when you're only trying to help someone. Allegiant Response, I am really sorry to hear about your experience, but thank you for letting us know. All of our team members are expected to be professional, respectful, and assist however they can. We truly regret that your experience contrasted with this. While I cannot",-1
2024-04-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnatti,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,cannot check your bags more than 2 hours early,True,"  No where is it posted that you cannot check your bags more than 2 hours early. We waited in line for 2 hours to check our bag only to be turned away and told we have to wait another 2 hours to check our bags. There is no where to sit or eat. We have 2 small children and had no where to go. The attendants taking the bags were incredibly rude and slow. Playing on their phones and talking with each other while the line was literally out the door. Once we came back to check our bags, again the attendant was rude. Our gate was changed without notice. The attendants working the gates didn’t even know it was changed. Again when asked they were rude giving the information.",-1
2024-04-07,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Springfield MO to Phoenix Mesa Gateway,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,“have not had any bad flights”,False, I have flown on Allegiant many times. I like this airline and up to April 4th have not had any bad flights. Thursday afternoon (this is not the airlines fault) a small child was seated behind me kicking my seat and playing with the fold up tray through a 2 hr. 30 min. flight. What is the proper procedure to attempt to encourage the parents to make their child stop.,1
2024-04-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orange County to Provo,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,horrible customer service,True," Flight delayed from one day to the next an almost 17 hour delay. Horrible customer service. Had to book a flight with another carrier to get home due to work, kids, etc. Absolutely horrible customer service and ended up costing almost an additional $900 due to this.",-1
2024-03-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Niagara Falls to Punta Gorda,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,"charged $75 for a book bag"" ",False,"   Allegiant charged $75 for a book bag that should be free. It is smaller than their guidelines call for and easily fits under a seat. In fact, I flew last month with this same bag and contents for free. Yesterday, some very rude employee decided to be miserable and make everyone else miserable and told me the bag was oversized. He charged me $75 and wouldn’t listen to reason. Customer Service was a joke. They tried telling me the bag was oversized without even seeing it. They told me the maximum dimensions allowed before being charged. The bag I had was under that size. When I offered to send a picture with the measurements, they declined and wouldn’t discuss it further. I have always flown Allegiant and have their MasterCard. I will no longer fly with them and will happily give up my card. In the long run, they are no cheaper than any other airline. Stay away from them.",-1
2024-03-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Orlando, FL to Cincinnati, OH",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"told her I paid for that seat"" ",True,"   Flew round trip. First flight delayed several hours before boarding- no water in bathrooms. once the problem was fixed, we boarded. After boarding completed, we then waited another 45 minutes because two luggage compartments would not stay closed. It took two men with proper paperwork to arrive with duct tape to secure the bins. No joke; duct tape. Return flight again delayed several hours. I purchased and pre-paid for an aisle seat in the front of the plane. Once seated, the attendant told me I needed to move over into the middle seat. I refused, told her I paid for that seat. She did not care. there was a husband that needed to sit with his wife (across the aisle) and I would be removed from the plane if I refused to move. As infuriating as the demand to move was, it was ten times more infuriating due to the cold, callous way in which she commanded me with nothing close to an apology for the inconvenience.",-1
2024-03-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Indianapolis,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,most rude and incompetent airline,True,"  This is without a doubt the most rude and incompetent airline in existence. I have flown many different airlines across the years, including cheap airlines like Spirit, and Allegiant simply is not worth the money — no matter how cheap the flight, it is severely over-priced because this airline is garbage. On this occasion, I had to change my flight so I could leave a day earlier and I waited hours upon hours for someone to answer my call. Then this incompetent man, at some call center ex-US, disconnects me. I have to repeat the entire process, more hours spent waiting for someone to answer. I was on the phone all day, literally. So I finally get my flight changed and the incompetent man charges me to change the flight, despite that I had paid extra to be able to change my flight. So the man issues a credit to me for a future flight instead of a refund.  Fast forward to my flight day and I am getting notices about my original flight, not the flight that I am headed to the airport for. So I go into the Allegiant app to see what is going on and even though I have a boarding pass for the new flight I am still booked on the old flight. Obviously a 9-year old can see the problem in this, but the incompetent Allegiant customer service rep cannot. So I attempt to cancel the the incorrect flight and I get a pop-up. It tells me it is too late to make changes and to call a special “back door” phone number. Here it is for you: 702-637-7038. My call is answered right away but by this time I am in my car headed to the airport. The agent, who is in the US, tells me that I am not actually on the flight that I am headed to the airport to board! I did mention that I have a boarding pass, right? Tell me how that happened! So she straightens everything out for me. She also tells me that the voucher the incompetent man emailed to me is unusable. So she sends a credit voucher that looks completely different.  Now since I had a credit on Allegiant, I had to dreadfully fly with them one more time. But never will I ever fly with this lousy airline again. So this time around, everyone that I communicate at Allegiant via phone or email regarding my request for accommodation as a disabled person for seat assignment and medical equipment is extremely rude. And as a disabled person they gave me an extremely hard time about accommodating my medical needs. I had to threaten them three times with going to the authorities — they attempted to lie to me and tell me that they are complying with all applicable laws. I told them that I know my rights and I would not let them get away with violating them. Finally they acquiesced but to be insolent they assigned me a seat in the last row of the plane and it was all very unacceptable. I had previously told them many times over that I need a far forward aisle seat to accommodate my medical needs. They refused! Their website even states that they will assign the seat to accommodate a disability! I have flown a lot and used many different airlines. My request for accommodation as a disabled person has always been met with prompt polite service. Until I traveled on Allegiant. What a bad business.",-1
2024-03-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Memphis to St. Petersburg/Clearwater,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,had to pay 150 for the luggage,True,"  I am a frequent flyer and used Allegiant check not luggage. I carry a backpack with two computers and a overcoat (weather dependent). I have placed this under my seat fully on over 50 Allegiant flights with no problems. This week I was last to board and as I entered the jet bridge someone started yelling at me and my companion (equal sized duffle). It was a gate attendant claiming we had to pay 150 for the luggage. We attempted to explain our history and show the size easily goes under the seat. The response was a hostile “if you want to fly tonight you have to pay for the luggage”. Extremely hostile. Feeling harassed and scammed, we paid to make our meeting. I followed up to the airline with pictures and requested clarification of policy. Their Customer Services team claims they can’t see/receive photos and it is staff discretion on luggage. Buyer beware.",-1
2024-02-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to st Petersburg,,,,,,,1,"never fly on this airline again"" ",False,"   Every flight that I've been on for the last year with Allegiant the stewardesses are extremely rude. I tried to use $121 worth of vouchers today to make a flight to St. Petersburg. After multiple tries and being on hold for 48 minutes for help with their customer service, I was unable to use my voucher dollars. I've concluded that no matter how inexpensive Allegiant they're just not worth it. They can keep my $121 voucher and never intended to allow me to use it anyway. I will never fly on this airline again",-1
2024-02-06,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Portsmouth,4.0,,5.0,,4.0,1.0,5,Allegiant airport’s lack of security,False,"  Flight 945 went well, but when we landed in Pease airport in Portsmouth on February 5, 2024 @ 5:36 PM it was dark outside. Retrieved luggage, then went to go outside as directed for taxi service, to find there was construction work with a few cement barriers guiding passengers to get to the taxi service areas. No direction signs posted and no outside lighting to make it clear and safe for us to get around the construction to the taxi area located on the other side of the building nearby the “departing flights main entrance area. Pulling luggage around a dark area without any personnel to direct people through a dark outside parking area on a rough walking path is dangerous.  We were completely shocked by Allegiant airport’s lack of security and safety precautions and measures for their customers. We are senior citizens and are completely shocked that an airline/airport had not ensured the safety of their customers/passengers.",1
2024-01-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Key West,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“next available flight was 3 days later”,True," Sat in the airport while flight was delayed for several hours to only hear the flight had been cancelled and the next available flight was 3 days later, which was when our return flight was scheduled. The pilot announced that they had to cancel due to a service issue causing a smell and that she wanted to be home by 8pm to put her kids to bed. In the meantime, my husband and I and our family are out $6000 for our vacation rental because we were not able to supply a 24 hr cancellation. When asking Allegiant about a refund for our vacation rental, we were basically told we were out of luck.",-1
2024-01-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Appleton to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1,"Worst experience ever"" ",True,"  When I got to the airport there was no one at the luggage counter to grab my checked bags that I paid for. So I had to bring them all through security. By the time I got to the terminal two staff wouldn’t let me on the flight claiming I was late when it was still grounded. They would not refund my $266. The manager was super rude & unprofessional. I went back to the bag counter & this staff just treated me like a loiterer when I was trying to get my refund & told me to leave the counter. I was inconvenienced my 10 year vacation that took weeks to plan along with hundreds of dollars for hotels with no resolution other than ”Your money is forfeited” from their customer service rep. Who clearly had no idea what she was doing after an excruciating painful wait time on hold. I had to wait hours for a cab because it was after a Packer game & they were the only cab in town. I emailed their customer service and got the same canned response. I asked repeatedly for a legal representation which they constantly dodged. Worst experience ever. I do not plan on, or recommend flying with this company ever. Spend the extra money & use a reputable airline that will actually let you on the flight you paid for instead of an off brand that profits & takes advantage of the average man.",-1
2024-01-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to Nashville,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4,"customer service is none"" ",False,"   On October 30, 2023 our flight 321 was cancelled from Nashville, TN to Cedar Rapids, IA. No reason was given and we were told to retrieve our baggage and prepare to stay overnight in Nashville. We were given two $50 vouchers for use on future Allegiant flights and also were sent an email for $175 compensation. That email content follows: Dear Valued Allegiant Traveler, We want to apologize for the inconvenience you experienced. In this instance, we did not meet our own expectations, and we are very sorry for the disruption it had on your travel plans. As a gesture of goodwill and demonstration of our sincere apology we have extended you additional compensation. To claim your funds, please select a payment option. Please click here. This link will expire in 48 hours. Our commitment to our customers is to provide a friendly, straightforward, safe and affordable travel experience. We are also committed to continuous improvement and hope you will give us an opportunity to better serve you in the future. Sincerely, The Allegiant Customer Care Team I followed the instructions carefully, choosing the virtual card. I received nothing after that message and trying to respond again to the link stated I had already been given the $175. The problem was, I never received anything further and since that time I have been trying to get someone to pay attention to my request to have this promised compensation delivered. I have contacted Allegiant customer service. I have contacted Paynuver customer service. I have been messaging via the Allegiant Facebook messaging link and have communicated with four different agents. I am told now that all agents are swamped with other issues so getting to my issue has taken a lower priority, if it has a priority at all. I simply want what was promised. I did not receive the $175 even though Allegiant records indicate I did. Nothing ever showed up to allow me to access the funds and I was told at one point (while communicating with Paynuver) that Paynuver would send the funds back to Allegiant so the process could be started again. The last Facebook message I received from Allegiant said...""Unfortunately, it is quite a process to get the funds reissued. Your information has already been sent to our Paynuver team and this will be reissued as soon as we can. We truly appreciate your patience."" If this process is this difficult when a problem crops up, why would Allegiant continue using the same process? Why would they continue to make promises of compensation, when they can't deliver on that promise? I could not be more flustered about this and though Allegiant may claim customer service is second to none, I would maintain that customer service is none.",1
2024-01-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lehigh vAlley to Myrtle Beach,,,,,,,1,not to give us credit,True,"  A travel advisory was issued for northeaster with anticipated 8 inches of snow - if our flight was cancelled or delayed we would not be able to return home for another 5 days. We called allegiant to change to an earlier flight, they acknowledged the snow storm but said I would lose all my money for my original flight. I even asked for just a credit as they now had 4 tickets unused for a flight but they also refused. One agent initially was going to at least give us a $230 credit but she then said she changed her mind, naturally my wife went off on her and she stated she would not our reservation so any future agents could see not to give us credit and then hung up. We tried talking to a supervisor but they never got on the phone as they refused.  I’d strongly advise to avoid the lower cost and go with a reputable airline",-1
2023-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newburgh to Punta Gorda,,,,,,,1,$382 out the window,False,"  This airline has given me plenty to complain about over the years, but they fly out of a local airport so I have dealt with it. Just cancelled a flight due to weather. Outside of their seven day policy, otherwise you get nothing! $50 cancellation fee per passenger. (Not happy about it, but I can deal with it). $44 carrier usage fee per passenger. (Don't even know what that is, but I see no reason to pay for it when the flight has been cancelled). Then, they keep the $100 I paid to fly my dog.  Are you kidding me? So $382 out the window, and to finish me off the turn what's left of my money into a voucher that must be used within twelve months, so I can feel the pain all over again.",-1

First they changed planes and told me that I had ton rechoose my seat after I paid extra for the front row for the leg room. Then when I got to the gate to board I was told that my paid carry on was too big and that I had to gate check it. The lady at the counter was extremely rude, told me it wasn't her problem that I didn't check in with her to make sure that it was okay even though I got the approval from another agent. When I got on board there were multiple bags that were in the overheads that were larger than mine. This airline is an absolute joke and a big rip off.",-1
2023-12-04,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Mesa-Phoenix,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,“Wow what a rip off”,False, Wow what a rip off. So I had never flown with this airline before but they were offering significantly cheaper flights so took a chance. The mobile app was confusing and the option to check bags was grayed out. When we got to the airport I'm informed I could have checked bags online for $30 each but since I hadn't (grayed out) it would cost me $75 per bag. So I cough up this additional expense and then board. In flight I'm offered a beverage and snack and then charged per item. Nothing complimentary on this airline! Next I complete my trip and go to head home on my round trip flight and am informed my bags were not checked for round trip and I need to pay yet another $75 dollars. So my $200 flight ended up costing me right around $450 after all the hidden fees. What a scam these guys are running. Be warned.,-1
2023-12-04,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Maria CA to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“Allegiant doesn't care for your plans”,False, Plane has been delayed for 3 hours now. Nobody is doing anything with airplane and so far I've lost my show tickets. All I want is a reimbursement. Allegiant doesn't care for your plans or you as a person. If they did they would reimbursement all of us. Never flying here again and don't recomend this airline. Time to expose them on social media.,-1
2023-11-29,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Norfolk,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,“What was your goal? To embarrass me?”,False,"  We flew from Ft. Lauderdale to Norfolk VA on Nov. 28th on flight 496. I would give 1 star but giving 2 stars to Allegiant Air because the pilot landed the plane with perfection and most of the crew were nice except for one woman. This flight attendant walked all the way from the back of the plane to my seat just to tell me that I didn’t flush the toilet. Now, I remember flushing it and thinking “wow that’s so loud,” but maybe it didn't go down all the way or maybe I my pregnancy brain got the best of me and I actually didn’t flush. You would have thought I left something disgusting behind but it was only toilet paper. Either way, what gives you the audacity to walk all the way up to my seat to tell me that I forgot to flush in front of the other passengers? When I tell you that I thought I did, you continue to argue with me that I in fact did not. What was your goal? To embarrass me? To teach me a life lesson? Did you feel better about yourself after telling a paying customer that you all just cancelled a flight on the night before after waiting half a day in the airport only to have it cancelled after boarding because the crew was timed out? We got a free soda for our trouble and a rude crew member. My entire life I have worked in the service industry from being a server to ER nurse and I understand that sometimes we get annoyed with people but I have always treated them with dignity and respect. You are dealing with the public and you represent a company that is providing a service and without that service, you wouldn’t have a paycheck. Keep up the attitude and you will be flushing your career down the toilet.",-1
2023-11-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Rockford,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,3,they don’t seem to care,False,"  My wife and I flew to Illinois for a funeral for my best friend in high school. I requested wheel chair assistance. We had wheelchair assistance plus we were allowed to take my wife’s walker up the ramp & they would store it until we got to Rockford, I’ll. Upon our arrival at Rockford the plane emptied out and my wife and I were left on the plane as other assisted passenger’s were taken off the plane as no one came to help us. One of the crew members had to call down to the airport for assistance. On our trip back from Rockford to Punta Gorda we arrived in Punta Gorda and got up in line like other passengers. The stewardess very rudely said you have to wait until all the other passengers deplane before you can. Well, lady we were ignored on our flight up so why wouldn’t we push forward to the front of the plane to make sure we’re not forgotten. We along with others were assisted off the plane in Punta Gorda. When we got to the bottom of the ramp we looked down at our walker that had been unloaded only to find the brake handle had been broken. We filed a claim ticket for the broken walker. We have yet to hear from the airline about this claim. I took the walker to a shop in Fort Myers and the gentleman told me it would cost $85.00 dollars for him to send it into be fixed plus the cost of labor and parts. He said I would be better off to buy a new one. I ordered a brake handle online for $24.00 of which I couldn’t find the right one but was able to replace the handle but the brake does not work. Needless to say we will pay more for our flights rather than fly Allegiant again. This was a very bad experience and on top of everything they don’t seem to care. Their attitude is probably they don’t care as they have plenty of other passengers that will fly with them.",-1
2023-11-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Maria to Las Vegas,3.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,super frustrating!,False,"  I have flown Allegiant 4 times in 3 weeks- same personal item (backpack) each time with no issues. On my 5th flight I went to board and the gate agent said I needed to talk to another one of the gate agents - not knowing why? I was asked to put my bag in their measuring device / it was overstuffed a little and she said you have to pay $75 now or you won’t get on the plane. I was flabbergasted. I explained I purchased this this backpack for exactly this reason and made sure it was in their personal item measurement requirements. Her comment to me was - Well I guess you are just lucky for the the 1st 4 flights and saved money. I was shocked and very mad. Paid for the carryon so I didn’t miss my flight - Mad and frustrated - got in my seat, tested the size of my backpack and it fit under my seat in front of me, but put it in the overhead bin, since they made me pay $75 for a space in the bin. Let’s just say- the flight was not full, we waited on the tarmac 45 minutes to take off, because they had to check everyone’s boarding pass individually again because individuals had not shown up for the flight, and top it off the overhead bins were 1/2 full. So the fee they made me pay was more than my flight- how is that even right? To finish off my trip I had one more leg of my flights from Las Vegas to Provo, UT. Checked in with the exact same backpack as a personal item and had no issues with its size and it was put under the seat in front of me with no questions. I will not be flying with Allegiant Air anytime soon - super frustrating!",-1
2023-11-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,"Sanford, FL to Tricites, TN",3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“Not a single care given!”,False," TERRIBLE! Got on one plane, to sit for an hour to get off the plane, then wait 4 hours for another plane, to get on a plane to sit down and be told the pilot time is up and they can't fly. Got off flight called customer service 4 times in total, flight rebooked for the NEXT DAY! First told leaving at noon, then told leaving at 8am, then told ten am. Now I have no boarding pass, told to go wait in line. They do not care! All for a 1.25 hour flight. Waste of my time. I was on hold that long! Not a single care given!",-1
2023-11-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Greenville to Sanford,,,,,,,1,Find another airline,True,"  I had a family health emergency and had to cancel my flight. They refused to work with me refunding the ticket and issued a credit which I will not be able to use. Will lose the entire amount. Also, they are a “cheap” airline and the ticket indeed is cheap, however, you have to pay for your seat, your carry on, your checked baggage, and if you want priority boarding. Any food you want including water must be paid for. Find another airline!",-1
2023-11-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Fort Lauderdale to Ashville,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,planes are so dirty,True," This airline should not even be allowed to fly. Bad service, flight attendants could not be worse, planes are so dirty that smell bad! When I boarded my seat was wet and greasy. Complained with flight attendant and all she did was to give me a piece of paper towel and advise me to clean it myself!! This was on flight 481 (FLL to AVL). On the return flight (496 AVL to FLL), boarding process started at 3:00 pm and was interrupted due to maintenance after 1:17h there is not even a agent at the gate and nobody had the courtesy to even provide an update. The worst is that this is just their routine. According to FAA chances of mechanic failures on Allegiant planes are 3.5 X higher than the average airline in the US. They changed the name but Allegiant Air is the same Las WestJet…",-1
2023-11-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando-Sanford to Asheville,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3,They should be ashamed,True,"  As I have flown so many times with Allegiant Air, recently I flew with them for my girls trip to NC. They should be ashamed of how they “handle” their consistent, returning, paying customers. I boarded my flight, row 4, and as usual, no overhead space for my carry on luggage. The flight attendants offered no assistance in trying to find space in the overhead compartments, and said, “you just have to look”. They also do not police patrons who board first, sitting further back, who just wanna throw their luggage up in front by so they can just grab it and go once we’ve reached our destination. I flew with 2 friends who managed to find spots, I however did not, so my luggage was taken by a flight attendant, who said it would be complementary checked, and was then taken off the plane. When we arrived at our destination, I went to the baggage claim, and when I saw my luggage, I couldn’t believe my eyes! The handle on my luggage literally was snapped clean off. No note, no one to meet me to explain its condition, just my bag circling the carousel with the broken off handle laying on top of my luggage. Went to customer service, directed to the Allegiant counter, filled out the claim form and was told that a representative would be contacting me. Received an email requesting pictures, the cost of my luggage, my mailing address and phone number, which gave me hope that perhaps compensation would be made. I am sharing my experience along with pictures of the condition of my luggage before I boarded the plane and then when I claimed it at the airport. I followed the instructions I was given. Not to mention I paid a carry-on charge of $30 which I feel I should be refunded since they took my luggage off the plane. Following is an email I received from Allegiant. Allegiant Air takes no responsibility for or accepts any liability for damage to my luggage and basically blamed me for having what they say is luggage with wear and tear not sustainable to the various handlings of luggage. My luggage is not very old and in perfect condition. So I guess this means they feel it was susceptible to damage. Just wanted to warn fellow travelers of this unfortunate experience and hope no one requires customer service with Allegiant Airlines because it is awful.",-1

They spent time on the phone with me, very courteous and helpful until the issue was solved. They found me a window seat when I had not chosen a seat. Very important. They are so kind and helpful.

2023-10-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to John Wayne,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,they charge for everything,False,  Worst airline. The price is cheap but they charge for everything. It even costs $5 to print a boarding pass. Delayed almost always. Cancels flights constantly.,-1
2023-10-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,One of the worst flights,True,"   One of the worst flights of my life. The staff was selling alcohol to people that were already obviously drunk which resulted in obnoxious and rude yelling for two hours straight from a group of guys in their 60s. I paid so much money to check my bag, pay for a carry on (which I wasn't even allowed to put in the overhead bins because it was a duffel bag and they told me they had to make room for more bags), and I couldn't even get a glass of water.",-1
2023-10-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fargo to Phoenix,,,,,,,1,worst customer service experience2,False,"  So it became clear that I was not going to be able to make my Allegiant flight. Three weeks before the flight I called the airline. I prefer speaking directly to a human and was hoping that I could get through to someone, or that there would be a call back option. I was a bit surprised that there was no toll free number. I suppose I'd be happier to wait on hold if I knew it wasn't costing me money and if I had some rough idea about how long the wait would be. Anyway after 15 minutes on hold (and knowing that the meter was running) I decided to try a different approach. I sent an email with all my information and asked that someone from the airline please contact me at their earliest convenience. I assumed I would hear from someone. Two weeks later after not hearing anything I reached out via the chat option on your website. I explained my situation and my previous attempts to contact the airline and hoped that my situation would be successfully resolved. The agent who was handling my file could not have been less helpful. Turns out the flight was seven days from the chat day so she said that according to the terms of the deal she was not obligated to refund or credit any portion of the flight. She seemed to really enjoy sharing that part. When I tried to highlight the fact that I had unsuccessfully reached out on precious occasions and that I thought that should be taken into consideration she responded rudely and was extremely condescending. When I asked to speak with her supervisor she ended the chat. I tried to get back in touch expecting that you had other agents working there but I got her. When I insisted that my concerns were not adequately dealt with, and when I again asked to speak to either her boss or another agent, she refused and ended the chat. This is honestly the first negative review I have ever posted. I found this to literally be the worst customer service experience I have ever been a part of.  I do understand that you're a discount airline, and that probably means that you can't allocate unlimited resources to your customer service department, but you should really try to hire people who genuinely care about your customers and also care about the reputation and image of your airline. The person I dealt with today very clearly cares about neither.",-1
2023-10-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,They refused to refund me the money,True," I booked a round trip flight with Allegiant in July. I've used one way and canceled the other one which I got a voucher for. I went ahead and used my voucher to purchase a new flight. But guess what when I made it to the airport I could not check in because they told me my ticket was canceled by Allegiant, they did so without even notifying me! They canceled it for no reason and the lady at the airport told me I had to buy a new one at the counter for 300 dollars in order for me to board the flight! When I tried calling Allegiant, I spent an hour waiting for them to pick up, I ended missing the flight! They only told me they are sorry they will look for another flight for me. But they couldn’t give me a valid reason why they canceled the ticket! And they told me the next flight available was in 5 days! When I had a second flight to catch on the next day in Florida. I requested to speak to a supervisor, they told me no supervisor is available. The agent even told me that the supervisor will not take the call because he already told me everything. They refused to refund me the money. They didn’t care about me losing my next flight! They just didn’t care at all! They kept on saying we can give a voucher or put u on the next flight in 5 days! Really! This is the worst airplane.",-1
2023-09-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Albany,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,We arrived in Albany and no pistol,True,"  I always check to see if I can bring one of my pistols. The state of Tennessee allows this so I brought one with me for our trip and have done this many times. In Albany Airport the drill is bring the locked case to the counter of the airline you are flying, whoever is working the counter calls TSA, TSA agent arrives, I open the locked case and then the TSA agent calls one of the Albany County sheriff’s and both look at my drivers license and my pistol license a I fill out a TSA card and sign it, the signed card goes in the case and I lock it, receive a baggage claim ticket and the locked case goes with all bags. On Friday we arrive at the Nashville airport and go to the Allegiant counter where we checked our bags and I tell the folks at the counter that I’m checking my firearm. All 4 had a deer in the headlights look. Now mind you this is Tennessee, not Connecticut or Massachusetts or New York. None of them knew what to do. So, I told them that they needed to call a TSA agent. My wife and I waited for 10 minutes and another Allegiant employee arrives, he fills out some paperwork and has me sign it and then tells me to take the paperwork and my firearm thru TSA security and give it to one of the people at our gate I looked at my wife and looked back at him and said “Are you sure about this, I have never done this before.” He said “Yes.” So off we go to TSA security with locked firearm case in hand. When we get to TSA security I explain to the TSA agent what just took place and he looks at me wide eyed and says “That’s disconcerting.” I then hear people yelling and turn to see 2 of the people who were working the counter and they said “sorry you need to come back to the counter and check your pistol.” Now the Allegiant employee has me open the case looks at the handgun puts paperwork inside and I lock the case and he takes it. My wife says “Are you going to give us a baggage claim ticket?” He replies “No, I’m going to put it with your bags.” My wife “Are you sure?” He says “Yes.” We arrived in Albany and no pistol.  I spoke to an Allegiant employee who said “Nashville is the worst Allegiant station in the country.” Of course my stomach is in knots because I’m worried that my handgun could be in the hands of a criminal. As I’m filling out paperwork my wife asks this gent “Should we file a police report?” He says “I would, these people need to learn a lesson and someone should be fired.” My wife locates 2 Albany County Sheriff deputies who come to the counter and I tell them the same story and both of them look at me in disbelief. The one sheriff walks away saying “let me make some phone calls.” Thank God for these 2 sheriffs. My pistol is in the hands of the Nashville PD, Thank the Lord. So tomorrow I have to call Nashville PD and speak to someone in charge of the evidence locker and have them ship it to an FFL. We also plan on calling Allegiant corporate headquarters and telling them the story.

Their website is constantly down-I can't book a flight online; this was a problem for many people. I waited on their phone line for 50 minutes before getting a Rep. who put me on hold 11 times because he didn't know what he was doing.The flight attendants are rude to the point of ignoring you - unless they chastise you for crossing the line to wait for the restroom. The only reason for flying with them is proximity to my daughter, which is no longer a good enough reason.",-1

After 2 weeks they still couldn’t find my luggage. After calling everyday and being on hold for 1-2 hours with no result. I was lied to by representatives saying it’s at Pittsburgh airport and I’ll receive it the next day which never happened. This was told to me over and over. I’ve left messages with no return calls. After the 2 weeks I emailed the CEO of Allegiant and all of a sudden I received an email almost ASAP saying my luggage is at the Pittsburgh airport and will go out today and I’ll receive it the next day which is today. Haven’t received it yet but we’ll see. Allegiant has horrendous customer service and they do not care for their traveling public. I will never fly with them again.,-1

The call timed out 3 times without being able to speak with a representative. The flight is today and we have been calling since yesterday morning to get this taken care of. As a valued credit card holder - this service is unacceptable. Regardless of system changes or updates, that should have been taken into consideration before making the change.

Sat there for 2.5 hours until I approached the counter and that is when I found out about it. Nobody could help me and they also told me that they didn’t care that I missed my flight. Employees at the airport and also customer service when I called to inform them were very unprofessional and rude. No one wanted to help and could care less about what me and my family were going through. They refused to refund my money and I had to spend an additional $1000 with another airline.,-1
2023-09-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Ashville,2.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,a no service airline,True, With tripflex I tried to change my flight from September 7th to September 10th. I started at 10:00 a.m. in the morning and was never able to get the website to change my ticket. I gave up after 7pm. I called the only phone number and waited an hour and a half for someone to pick up to no avail. The plane left this morning without me. $200 plus down the drain. Fortunately a friend is driving home so I can hitch a ride back to Florida on the 9th. My daughter-in-law just tried to book tickets which she does on a regular basis and the travel agent said they do not book Allegiant ever. So my daughter-in-law tried to book her ticket which she has done many many times - again to no avail. How the heck are they still flying? This is a no service airline!,-1

I was on hold for 3 hours spoke to two representatives who just push me along. Screwed my checking account up - charged me eight times for a flight.

2023-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sarasota to Allentown,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3,I will never fly Allegiant again,True,"  I was boarding my plane with my AED in one hand (I have a heart condition) and a bag of diabetic medical equipment (my wife has type 1 diabetes) in my other hand. I have flown with this equipment before as a free carry-on item both with Allegiant a few days prior and other airlines before then and have never once had to declare anything and have never been given any problems. As I board the plane, I walk by the stewardess. She looks me up and down and then turns to her friend and says ""Here we go again. I can't believe people are trying to get free carry ons."" Her friend responds with, ""Yeah, maybe you should tell them to put that in the special bins on the outside of the plane. Implying to throw my medical equipment out of the plane."" I was completely taken back but I did not want to get into an argument at this point so I did not say anything because I just wanted to get on my flight and go home. After a few minutes go by another stewardess comes up to me after I sat down and she starts asking me questions about what am I carrying and why. I explained that I have a heart condition and that my doctor recommends that I carry it with me but is not required. She leaves and after about 5 more minutes the gate attendant comes up to me asking to have a private conversation about what's going on so I walk off the plane with him. Side notes this has now gotten the attention of everyone on the plane and everyone was staring at me and probably wondering what's happening. The attendant precedes to start asking me very personal questions both medical and not medical which I do not want to repeat. They threatened to have me removed from the flight if I did not provide the information. All because I am carrying a medical device that was already approved by security. I am very upset at this point. I give them all of the information they ask for and then wait outside the plane for 15 minutes as they are talking both on the phone to people and in person. At this point the captain, airport security, 3 stewardesses, and gate attendant were all around me, the gate attendant was extremely rude and disrespectful. They finally let me back on the plane while my whole family is waiting and every single person on the flight is staring at me as I walk to my seat. One lady come up to the front as I was walking back on to ask ""why did you take him off the plane?"" The only kind person that I talked to was the pilot, but everyone else was rude, mean, and disrespectful of my privacy. I will never fly Allegiant again. I have tried to call customer service multiple times and have sat on hold for multiple hours and never got to talk to someone.",-1
2023-08-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Destin to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely no accountability,True," This was the worst flight experience I've ever had. The flight was delayed 14 hours, and not a single employee cared about anything. Not a single compensation, rewards points offer, free transfers, inter-airline communication, refund, or deal. They stranded 100-150 people in an airport and made it clear it wasn't their fault so everyone was on their own. Absolutely no accountability and the customer service line given was no further help but rather an echo that Allegiant doesn't care about its customers. Horrible airline, and I will never fly this airline again. Needless to say on top of that, they tried to charge me $75 for a carry-on after being delayed 14 hours and REFUSED to comp it. I only got out of it for being military but when I asked about compensating everyone else's, the manager ran away saying ""if you have any suggestions let us know. Allegiant cares."" As I was literally giving her a suggestion and she didn't care. Then even after we finally boarded the next day, we sat on the tarmac for ANOTHER hour with no update other than an announcement saying ""if you're in a large group, can you tell us if you're missing someone?"" I presume they miscounted or someone was missing, but still no communication from the staff. AND THEN they boasted that the stale peanuts and soda was ""on the house to make up for the delay.""",-1

2023-07-12,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Petersburg to Portsmouth,3.0,,1.0,,,5.0,5,Expect zero customer service,True,"  Expect zero customer service or customer relations when you fly Allegiant. On July 1 my wife and I flew from Tampa to Portsmouth. The woman in the row with us took her dog out of its bag. The stewardess told her two times that pets must stay in their bag at all times but did nothing to make sure she complied. The dog had diarrhea all over the place, ruined my wife's running shoes and bag. Unbelievable, right? The woman apologized but set the soiled dog carrier on my wife's lap while she worked to clean up the mess. It reeked! The stewardess came over and spritzed some air freshener but did nothing to help us. When I contacted customer support requesting reimbursement or a voucher, an agent told us there would be no reimbursement or vouchers saying Allegiant ""has no control over the behavior of passengers."" I am totally shocked. Otherwise, Allegiant has always got us where we are going at the best price with no frills.",-1

Got delayed in TSA mess and no attendants at the gate. Was there 18 minutes prior to the flight departure. Staff came out from the locked door and said they had a jam up in the jetway, couldn’t get in as they closed the door behind them. Watched the plane pull away for 18 minutes.

They had zero organization and when we finally got to our gate there was no one at the gate. There was no announcements and no gate agent with our take off time came and passed. Our flight crew arrived and they told everyone we’re just waiting on the gate agent. Where is this gate agent? No answers no information nothing. Don’t ever fly with Allegiant,-1

We lost $1,300+ for our hotel that they were not willing to give any compensation for due to them canceling our flight after we had been there for hours. Will never use Allegiant again.

2023-07-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,This is exactly how you lose loyal customers,False,"  Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6pm on June 30th. The gate was very full of excited people who were supposed to be flying to Fort Lauderdale. My husband checks his phone and sees the flight is delayed in the Allegiant app. I checked Flight Aware and Google which both said on time. I went to the desk at the gate and no one was there. I asked other passengers what was going on, they said they didn’t know either but someone who works for Allegiant was at the desk just long enough to tell them, “I don’t know what’s going on. Just sit still.” So they did. I checked the Departures board, said on time. 15 minutes later, everyone’s phones go off. Allegiant sent a TEXT to all passengers about the delay. Not one human interaction! We go get dinner. We are waiting in the USO for our now 8.18pm flight. I’m checking my phone every five minutes since not one person could tell us anything. 35 minutes before we should board, we get another TEXT. This time, it’s cancelled! I furiously went to the gate desk. Once again, not one human is there to tell us what’s going on. Just a lot of angry passengers. I ask any employee I can find, where can I get help? Every single person I asked said to Google it and call Allegiant. I tried but “due to the cancellation of your flight, we are experiencing high call volumes.” Couldn’t get through. Now we are panicking about where our luggage is. Once again not one person could tell us where it was. Finally, after my daughter and I ran to the baggage claim, I found a gentlemen who worked for the airport that pointed us in the right direction. My husband went to the Allegiant desk where you check in. They told him they didn’t know anything about the flight either but that everyone would get vouchers and $150. What about the money we spent on the vacation we were going to? All communication was via text! Shame on you Allegiant! My family has loved flying with this airline. This is exactly how you lose loyal customers.",-1

2023-06-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Springfield,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,1,I will pay higher fares to avoid them,True," This was my return trip and I was charged $50 at the gate for my “additional carry on bag”. I had a shoulder bag and a purse, both of which fit comfortably below the seat in front of me. I had both of these same bags on by first trip and was not charged. Ridiculous. They seemed to be very interested in getting everyone boarded early and as quickly as possible on both legs of the trip. The first leg we were able to leave early just to sit on the runway for an extra 30 minutes because there was no gate available. This trip we were rushed to board just so the gate staff and the flight attendants could chat while the pilots still got ready to depart. All the while we were stuck in our very uncomfortable seats without the ability to recline and practically on top of each other. Even the tray tables were more of a phone holder than a table, they were so small. You have to purchase even water, and there is no Wi-Fi or anything similar available. I can’t stand Southwest Airlines, but Allegiant makes Southwest look like a luxury airline. Taking Allegiant saves me 3 hours of driving to and from the airport and I will drive to a farther airport from now on and pay higher fares to avoid them.",-1
2023-06-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sarasota to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,So disappointing and astounding,False,"  I write reviews a lot online, and 95% of the time, I only write reviews for positive interactions. I feel that negative reviews are generally screwed by emotion, frustration, or anger. And that we have enough negativity in our world. So I try to keep things positive. In this case, I think it’s necessary to document the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced - which came from Allegiant phone customer service. I have never been treated so poorly by an employee of a company that I’ve spent hundreds of dollars patronizing (or any company, for that matter). There was a mix-up when my family flew in for a visit. Their return flight was canceled after they missed an outbound flight, and when we realized this (the night before their return flight), I called to understand the situation. Originally, the gate agent told them their return flight would not be canceled but that they could keep it. So we were surprised when we couldn’t find the reservation for them to check-in. The person who I talked to on the phone to try to fix the problem was unbelievably rude. After discussing the situation, she didn’t believe my family because the agent didn’t make notes, and her attitude toward me was unlike any experience I’ve ever had with a customer service person. I intentionally did my best to stay calm, not raise my voice or have a frustrated or angry tone and asked to speak with her supervisor after she yelled at me. After continuing to be berated by the employee, I calmly continued to ask to talk with her supervisor. She denied me the opportunity several times (she said the supervisor couldn’t help) and eventually *hung up the phone on me!* I understand and can appreciate how hard customer service jobs must be. So again, I did everything possible not to talk down to this person or raise my voice. And I was hung up on. I don’t understand how this airline could possibly prioritize basic respect for one another if this was how their employee acted. I assume they are not teaching patience or customer care (human care) in any fashion. Honestly, nobody should be treated with the disrespect this person showed. The way I was treated was not worth saving a little money to fly cheaply. I could not get this person's name or employee information and am not sure how to follow up on such an extreme situation, so I’m writing a review online in hopes of steering others away from such a challenging circumstance and genuinely negative interaction with another human being. Our world has enough trouble and challenges these days; there should be no reason to experience interactions like this one, especially in a professional setting. So disappointing and astounding that this happened.",-1

No compensation, customer service said they had no idea why the flight was delayed. Then, the departing flight from Vegas was Delayed an hour, and once we did board (an hour after that) We are all told that the air conditioning on the plane is broken. They're very quick to apologize for the inconveniences. First time flying Allegiant Air. Probably my last.",-1

I was told 2 different things by 2 different agents about a credit voucher after requesting to cancel a flight 7 days in advance due to my son’s medical emergency! I was only given a $108 credit for a $448 purchase. They nickel and dime you to death but are not flexible. The WORST airline with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!,-1

2023-05-16,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Flint to Las Vegas,1.0,4.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,he decided not to fly at all,True,"  Flight was originally scheduled May 12 from FNT to LAS. We received an update flight was being delayed reason given was that there was air traffic controller issue at LAS. FAA site confirmed that a runway had to be closed etc. The problem here is a few mins after the announcement I saw the pilot walk off the plane with all his belongings. But the gate agents continued to update as flight is delayed. Hours later the airline gave an update calling it an extended delay and the flight will not leave until May 13. I thought it was odd that the pilot who left never returned. Because the pilot got tired of waiting he decided not to fly at all. The crew from May 13 advised us of that. So we missed a vacation day, lost money on non-refundable tours, etc… all be use Allegiant pilot through a childish temper tantrum for a 3 hour delay. We could have flown and made it to the destination on May 12. Allegiant found a loop hole pertaining to cancellation of flight by calling it an extended delay vs. cancellation. So by doing so they avoid providing refunds for the trip. Not sure about anyone else, but if a scheduled flight does not leave the day it’s supposed to then that is a cancellation in my book. Allegiant ruined a part of my vacation and we only got a voucher that did not even come close at recovering the money we lost because of a single pilot was tired of waiting. I’m astonished that an airline who operates this way is still even around. . This is a low cost airline, and I know that you get what you pay for but there are limits to that even. On a good note airline had to call in a crew to fly us to LAS on their normal day off. That was about the only nice thing that came of this.",-1

My flight out was delayed 4 hours. We ended up spending more time sitting on the runway than actually traveling. I was running late for my returning flight (my fault) and I spoke to every employee I could find to help me make my flight. They said you’re going to have to run and maybe you’ll make it. So I was one of those people sprinting through the airport up and down stairs through crowds and I make it to the gate and they said we have a delay. Something they could have told me before I pushed my cardiovascular health to its limits. At this point we have a 2 hour delay because of “mechanical issues” with no end in sight. You always hear the cheap airlines are bad: Allegiant might be the worst of them all. If I could, I would rate them -10/10. I booked this flight in the first place in an act of desperation: it was the only option. Next time, I’ll walk.",-1

Flight was delayed for 2 hours with no explanation. Then, 3 hours after we were originally supposed to fly out, they cancelled the flight.

So you’re telling me every time there is a holiday you are going to delay/ cancel a flight because of high traffic? Ridiculous. Not to mention last time I flew with them I was stranded at the airport for 4 hours because they were fixing the brakes of the airplane and I didn’t get to my destination till 1 am.

It took weeks of back and forth in emails before the bag was finally shipped to my final destination. Throughout this process, I found that Allegiant's customer service team kept tossing the ball to each other, with no one taking responsibility or ownership of the issue. Despite my repeated attempts to get a resolution, there was no customer service whatsoever. No one was able to take responsibility and fix my issue. To add insult to injury, the file was closed on their system without issuing the refund I was promised. It was a complete nightmare, and I am extremely disappointed in the way Allegiant handled my case. Overall, I would strongly caution against using Allegiant for travel. Their lack of customer service and failure to issue refunds when necessary make them an unreliable and unprofessional choice. Save yourself the trouble and choose a different airline.",-1

When returning for the flight back home, the counter agent was unable to help us with the issue and give us a number to call for support. I have called the number over 50 time with zero answer.

2023-04-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Grand Junction,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,untrained and extremely rude employee,True,"  
I fly frequently and experienced the worst customer service ever with Allegiant. I had to go to the agent at the desk to get my boarding pass printed because my ID was not scanning with TSA. When I asked the agent at the desk to print my boarding pass she demanded that I pay for another bag. All I had was my small personal item and a paper bag with food in it ended up leaving my bag with my dinner in it because I didn’t want to pay the $50 charge for another bag. So ridiculous. It says right in the rules that you are allowed to bring food in addition to the personal item. Clearly an untrained and extremely rude employee. I submitted a complaint to Allegiant and got nowhere. Just a vague apology. I had requested to be reimbursed for the food that I had to inappropriately throw away. Just some reply about how they couldn’t possibly do anything else at this point. Zero effort to take responsibility for their untrained rude and inappropriate employee.",-1

And it was only for 2 hours flight to Sarasota. They told that ""there is heavy air traffic at Sarasota"" but when I checked over Flight Radar there wasn't a huge amount of traffic. They are lying to customers.",-1

Do not fly this airline unless you don't care if you make it to your destination. They canceled my flight today for no reason and no explanation given. They had no other alternative flights. This is the second time this has happened to me. They, by far, are the most unreliable airline. Service is poor and they run a cattle car system. Not worth the time or effort to trust this airlines with you travel needs.",-1

No snack or drink provided. No communication about the delays. Seats suck I have nothing positive to say about this entire travel experience. No one could tell us the time we were delayed too. The crew thought they were leaving and they tried to hold them. No one has any idea what is going on. No TV no nothing.,-1

We were supposed to fly out at 8:50 pm we got to the airport at 6:45 everything was OK tell a hour later when the first two hour delay happened, then from 11pm to 12am, then 1am, then 2, we boarded the plane at 4am sat in the plane another hour before taking off. We missed our car rental had to take a $300 uber straight to Orange County Convention Center so we wouldn't miss the education we were there for, zero sleep, we left the Convention at noon had to find a car to rent from there. I was so upset with the customer service I kept the rented car and drove back to Indiana 20 hours and several extra hotel meals. That delay if they would have told us from the start I could have made other flight plans, but we were told it won't be long now. So many times. When we did get on the plane they didn't give us any beverages and I'm even a Allegiant air card member, I have had 3 flights this year with them and every flight has been delayed.",-1

In early morning Hrs,- unable to access email, They canceled flight for no apparent reason other than under booked flight! Their only response was to refund my return trip and rebook me for 4 days later at an additional cost if $86 to me! No concern that I had to find hotel & transportation until then, at a cost of no less than $700 to me. They are very unreliable and not worth the risk",-1

They deboarded us and after about 45 mins had us board a different plane, and it had a problem with its door too. Another hour in the plane waiting for repairs. And then they wanted to charge us for sodas and chips. Found out our flight is late 60% of the time. Never flying this airline again, I can’t imagine they’ll be around very long anyway.",-1

""The pilot was too tired"". While I am pleased the pilot didn't attempt to fly, the airline did not offer any other option. They sent a link for $175 for our inconvenience but the link does not work and in fact, expires! The very next day, the new itinerary, was moved from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm in the evening. Again, no notice and this time it was ""the airport delay"". For the pleasure of flying with Allegiant, I incurred over $1200 in additional travel expenses. Not one professional apology or effort to make the travel better. It doesn't matter that individuals had deadlines and places to be and they could care less. The final straw, we had rebook the flight because the second flight was cancelled. They had the nerve to recharge us! Unbelievable. Trust me, you get what you pay for with this airline. Just pay Delta; get to your destination without worrying about this BS.",-1

2023-04-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ashville to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Disappointed an understatement,False," Absolutely horrible airline - their staff’s negligence and incompetencies lead to 60+ minutes sitting on the tarmac due to 10,000 POUNDS of over-fuelling; with no air circulation, compensation offerings (on, or off the plane), and the demand for a de-plane with a subsequent 2+ hour delay. Their excessive and inexcusable oversight caused countless missed flights, canceled classes, and over-heated, parched, passengers. The least they could do is offer SOME compensation for their passengers for their mistake(s), but that never came. Disappointed is an understatement, I will never be flying with them again.",-1

Canceled our flight 1 hour before we were supposed to depart and their excuse was they ""didn't have enough staff"". Told us there wasn't going to be another one until 10pm on Monday when it was currently Saturday. We had to rent a car and are currently having to drive 16hrs straight home. They didn't even care to cover the cost for all the extra money we had to spend because they were unorganized and irresponsible. Take my advice and spend the extra money on a good airline!

We arrived several hours before our flight boarded. We dropped our bags off at the ticket counter as usual and proceeded to board our flight. When we arrived in Florida we discovered that our bags never made it onto the plane. Allegiant offered to put them on the next plane to Destin, but that was Sunday evening and we were returning Monday and our bags would do us no good at that point. We were told by the agents at the ticket counter in Florida that we could purchase whatever we were missing and we would be reimbursed. We were told that we would be reimbursed for the baggage fee since they never sent our bags. It's been months since I've sent our information to be reimbursed without any response.

2023-03-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to San Diego,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,Terrible experience,True," I'll preface this by saying the crew was fantastic. Unfortunately that's the only positive. First, they charge 50 bucks for carry on. I got that free on the flight to Austin with Alaska. Then a gate agent called too many zones at once and it turned into a big mess. On-board it was cramped and the seats are just metal with fabric. My back is feeling it today. And there is no wifi nor even a tiny snack or cup of water available, even water is pay only. Terrible experience. Shouldn't exist as an airline.",-1
2023-03-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Norfolk,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,The worst airline ever,True,"  The worst airline ever. Plane was dirty, crumbs on the seats. Stewardess were extremely rude. By the time you pay for the check in bags, the carry on bag, and then tried to charge me for my purse because it was a personal item. Zero form of entertainment, and 400% up charge on snacks and drinks simply makes the cheap tickets worthless.",-1
2023-03-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Allentown,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I do not recommend this airline,True,"  Horrible experience, I flew with my wife and 3 children, The flight was set to board at 6:15 and it didn’t. Then once boarded it took about an hour to fly out. When we finally flew out everything was fine until the pilot flew into a storm and did not even warn the passengers or flight attendants who were in the aisle selling beverages with the cart. The Turbulence was horrible and out of nowhere the plane dropped several feet in the air with passengers scared to death and screaming. My children had a horrible scary experience, the pilot finally tells everyone he is in a storm and to buckle up that if he has to descend and land he will but for now buckle up and stay in your seats the flight attendants had to run back to there seats and secure the drink cart. Very horrible trip. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.",-1

The pilot gave no warning of an upcoming storm and while the flight attendants were out giving drinks the entire plane dropped several feet and the people on the plane screamed in fear. My baby woke up scared to death and my two other children yelled. They continued to fly in the storm instead of go around it and put us all in danger. Do not fly Allegiant.",-1

They are the most unreliable airline that I have ever flown - do not trust them at all - they will cancel your flight less than two hours before you are to leave and for no reason at all - they never respond to emails, phone calls (after being on hold for 4 hours), or Facebook Messenger! They need help - some other airline needs to buy them now!",-1

""They do strand you."" They will not help you get home. They might give you a voucher to fly again for a portion. (If you can get a hold of them). Cost me $800 for 2 people to get home when they canceled the flight for maintenance. Originally cost $200ish round trip. One year prior, they did the same to us. Cost us an extra $400 then. Different airport. Will never fly again. Was offered $10.00 refund for our flight home this time. Ask to talk to a supervisor, and they will say no, take it leave, or they will hang up the call was their response.",-1

We recently booked two flights and it automatically upgraded us to some weird bundle, which resulted in almost a $200 up charge. Naturally, we cancelled and rebooked. The only problem was that we used some of our points to book the first time. Not only did we not get our points back, they shorted us $15 on the refund. We waited for hours on the phone to talk with someone. Never even got through. Very annoying.",-1

The flight to and from were both delayed 1-2 hours. The flight arrivals were 1 hour late and you spend another hour sitting in the plane waiting for it to start moving. Minimal space for seating, smallest tray tables I've seen on any flight, and they will charge you for beverages or food/snacks. They offer no in flight entertainment. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money for a much better airline.",-1

2023-03-11,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Minneapolis,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,I’ll forever be grateful for them,True,  I was recently on an Allegiant flight from Asheville NC to Minneapolis MN (Flight 237). I was feeling nauseous after 45 minutes into the flight so I got up to use the restroom in the rear of the plane. Once I got to the back i became extremely dizzy and I blacked out. I could hear people talking to me but I couldn’t see anything. The Allegiant flight attendants acted fast to put an oxygen mask on me and laid me down on the floor. I believe two nurses were on my flight too who checked my pulse and blood pressure. I wish I knew their names so I could thank them for jumping up to make sure I was ok. Very scary moment for me but everyone who helped me made sure I was comfortable as I came back to and I’ll forever be grateful for them.,1

My boarding pass said to to board at 7.20 am and to be there 2 hours prior. Showed up on time, waited for over an hour and no Allegiant employee ever showed up to check myself and my bags in. This is unacceptable! This was supposed to be a surprise birthday trip for my elderly grandmother and this companies lack of compassion for its clientele has ruined it! This is a weekend I will never get back!",-1
2023-03-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,having computer issues,False," Been on vacation to Punta Cana. Get to the airport and check in at 10:30 am for a 1:00 pm flight home. Sat on the plane for 2 hours while they explain to us that they're having computer issues. After 2 hours they make us all disembark from the plane and haven't given us a status, just keep pushing the time out. First time ever flying with this airline, will be the last. I'd be willing to fly the Three Stooges airline if there eas such a thing, before ever flying Allegiant again.",-1
2023-03-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Harrisburg to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,non-existent customer service,False,"  I am pretty sure that the Allegiant Air executives do not care to read or to pay attention to the reviews of their airline - for them, the revenue and the profit is the most important. Not the passengers. Not the service. I was scheduled to fly from Harrisburg, PA, to Ft. Lauderdale, FL on March 2nd - Allegiant flight #507 leaving at 6:26pm. Without any notifications or warnings, the flight has been re-scheduled 8 times for the departure at 10:45pm (more than 4 hrs delay). At the same time, there was NO ONE from the airline at the gate to convey/explain the delay or to communicate any related information. I've tried to chat with the customer service via the website but to no avail (""sorry, our agents are not currently available""), tried calling the customer service - waited for 1.5 hrs to no avail either. Overall, it is an ultra low cost airline (although I paid a pretty hefty price for a one way ticket - the same as on United Airlines in opposite direction) with a non-existent customer service and the lack of responsibilities. If you are enjoying spending long-long hours being delayed and arriving in the middle of night (2-3am instead of 9pm), having ""zero"" customer service - yes, choose Allegiant Air!",-1
2023-03-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Bangor to Sanford,",5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,1,I'm through with Allegiant,False,"  Flight 1911 originating in Bangor Maine. Scheduled to take off at approximately 3:40pm on 2/28/23. 90 Min delay right off the bat. Then another delay and another delay. Then boarding takes place and we have to be de iced. Had to get in line for that. waited an hour then went to runway, waited so long there de icing had expired. Back to De icing area, sat and waited. Never happened. Then Flt attendant said airport closing for an hour. Back to the gate, deplaned. After a while boarded again. Went to de ice. Never happened. Say for 30 or 40 min. Back to the gate. Flight attendant says they ran out of de icer. Please keep in mind this is Bangor Maine in mid winter. Flight is finally delayed until 3/1 at 1 pm. 3/1 1pm no plane2:30 still no plane. in the meantime, their flight scheduled for 31 are taking off. Customer service rep tells us that they are flying a plane in from Pennsylvania to finally take us to our destination over 24 hours late. I've spent the better part of two days now at the Bangor airport and I'm not spending any more and so I asked for my bags back, and I rebook with a flight to Tampa on Thursday evening. And I drag all my bags back to the car and leave just spend another night in the motel and then I think better of what I've done and so I cancel everything, including the booking that I made for the end of March, I'm through with Allegiant. The customer service people were very nice and unfortunately they are trapped with the angry customer so they have the worst job of anyone. In fact, I just acquired and allegiant air credit card because I was using the airline so much and I will be cutting that up in the very short pieces and sending it to someone with instructions on what they could possibly do with it.",-1

I asked why and the attendant had no idea. I lost the flight. I have trying to get in touch and that is a laugh. They do not return emails or answer the phone. I have sat on the phone for hours and no attendant. I have lost the $500 and I have tried to reach out to them and they just ignore you. I would not fly them again.,-1
2023-03-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Grand Rapids, MI to St Pete, FL",1.0,,2.0,,,3.0,3,an awful flight there and back,True," I will never fly Allegiant again. Was an awful flight there and back. First flight had 3 drunk guys sitting behind us at 9am. Many complaints but flight crew didn't do anything about it. They would rather save 3 than the many who sat around them behind bothered by the yelling and bad language. The flight back was even worse. The people directly behind us had a medium size dog that whined and yelped loudly the entire 2.5 hour trip. The dog was under my seat so it was even louder for me. The owners only were addressed by the crew when they were caught with the dog sitting openly on their lap. Not being bad enough, the dog was also passing gas. One of the requirements listed on Allegiants website is the animal must be ""non disruptive"". This definitely was not the case and the flight crew was not eager to do anything about it. Not to mention that both of us are allergic and were sneezing. I did reach out to Allegiant with my complaint. Their answer was shocking and dismissive to say the least. They pretty much said, in short, that it's my problem and they did nothing wrong. I asked to speak to someone else and I've been brushed off. Again, they are going to lose passengers to save the feelings of two people. This isn't very good business!",-1
2023-02-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sandford Orlando to Plattsburg,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,"Poor planning, horrible customer service",True," By far the worst airline and service. We flew to Plattsburgh from Florida and back to Florida- without landing. Apparently, conditions were too icy to land in NY so the entire plane was flown back to its Florida destination. We had been on the plane since 7 am and during the now 7 hour flight we were offered complimentary pretzels and water. Everyone’s trip was ruined, we were exhausted, and hungry sitting in seats with no cushion, and that’s the best they could do. Also - did no one check conditions before that plane took off? And why could it not have rerouted to Allegiant Albany terminal which was fully operational? Poor planning, horrible customer service, and the most god awful experience I’ve ever had. You’d be better off walking.",-1
2023-02-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Puerta Gorda to Nashville,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,first and last trip with them,True,"  On my return flight from Puerta Gorda to Nashville, their baggage handling destroyed my Samsonite, indestructible up to their handling, Hardcastle golf case on the return trip to Nashville. Instead of having a complaint Baggage claim desk near Baggage claim, I was forced to drag my damaged golf case as well as my other luggage back upstairs too the ticketing, Check-In desk to file a claim. The attendant, while being one of the most pleasant people was unable to file a claim. They took my information and was told, we will contact you. For those who purchase Samsonite products, you have to believe they purposely destroyed my property. That case, over the last two years has been in 3 different continents. Only Allegiant managed to damage my property. I have no doubt that they will not contact me nor provide, at the very least, repair my golf case. This was my first and last trip with them. They are cheap in every meaning of the word. Next time I will pay more to land farther away from my destination, rent a vehicle and arrive happier.",-1
2023-02-11,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to Mesa,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3,Allegiant doesn't care about their customers time,True," We had a morning flight that they screwed up sending the check in email. We went to check in at the desk and they wouldn't do it because it was “too close to boarding time”. Funny thing is, boarding hadn't even started and the flight wasn't scheduled to leave for 43 more minutes. Keep in mind this is a tiny airport, and going through security and getting to the gate takes 10 minutes or less. But anyway, they wouldn't do it and so we had to reschedule for a later flight. We came back a few hours later and and waited at the gate only to be told that our flight was canceled because they needed to do maintenance on the plane. The next flight wouldn't depart for another 7 hours. In short, Allegiant doesn't care about their customers time or inconvenience, and they definitely don't care about good communication.",-1
2023-01-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to Mesa,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,will never fly Allegiant again,True,"  We were ticketed for the early morning flight from Provo to Mesa. Rcvd and email saying time to check in so the night before we did our check-in. Silky smooth using the Allegiant app. All good, flight says on time, this is about midnight for an 8:15am departure. We show up at the airport to do the bag drop but there is no bag drop line. Just one line for ticketing, checkin and bags. We wait in line and after about 20 mins an agent calls out anyone on the Mesa flight has to see her. Turns out the flight the night before was 8 hours late so our flight was getting bumped 12 hours. Didn't we get the email? (no email, no text, no alert on the app.) None of the other passengers we talked with had any notice either. Agent offered to book us on their noon flight but that flight is full. The event we were traveling for was for tonight so our plans were blown up totally. We offered to drive to SLC to get a flight on another airline but they were unwilling to book us. Told we should be getting a $100 voucher and our tickets would be refunded in a week or so. And if we don't get refunded come on back in and they will work on it. Last minute pricing and flight available prevented us from rebooking ourselves so home we go. Love flying out of the smaller regional airports but will never fly Allegiant again.",-1
2023-01-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Nashville,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,beyond infuriated with our experience,True,"  My husband and I were seated towards the back of the plane. Row 25 to be exact. It was a full flight. No issues there. However, during take off one of the other passengers managed to leave an open alcoholic beverage in the overhead carry on area. This alcoholic beverage found its way 2 seats back to pour onto my husband and I. I do mean poured on us!! Overhead luggage was soaked in what smelled to be whiskey and so were our clothes. Let me also add that my husband is 11 days out of Alcohol rehab! So needless to say this caused even more issues to the 3 screaming babies on board and the 4 very intoxicated passengers surrounding us. Those are things we could have handled and expected, but to be doused by alcohol during take off and to return home with our luggage soaked in it was infuriating. To add insult to injury, when we brought it to the flight attendants attention, she was attentive to drying out the over head bins with paper towels but never offered to hand us something to dry off with. I am beyond infuriated with our experience with this airline!",-1

We measured it beforehand to assure it was the proper size. They tried to strong arm us into paying $100 for the bag. We even re-arranged items between our group to fit their request, but the worker still refused to check the bag. Needless to say we were denied access to the flight, and were told there was no refund.",-1

2023-01-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Idaho Falls,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,"comical, unbelievable errors",True,"  My daughter flew from Phoenix to Idaho Falls flight 636, Jan 3rd. Here is the sequence of comical, unbelievable errors by Allegiant, but most disturbing was the nonchalant attitude with no communication and mitigation to the errors. -Flight was late (not usually that big of a deal). After arriving, she waited over two hours for a ""paid"" check baggage, with no communication at all on eta or reason from Allegiant staff. She had been picked up by a mother with a baby, so they had to call it a night after 2.5 hrs.  A passenger wandered out to the Tarmac to see if he could get info about what was going on .The passenger came back and reported that there may have been an accident with the ground crew, that Allegiant was short staffed, and they had no ETA. At no time did Allegiant send a message to my daughter through Text or the App (even though you have her information, and knew she checked a bag - With no information, and with no-one at Allegiant Airport picking up the phone or calling us back (we left messages) the communication was completely irresponsible and non-sympathetic to the passenger schedules (like college classes). I called twice myself and no one returned calls. She went back, paid for transportation there on the next day, Jan 4th, but no one from Allegiant was there (couldn't you pay for 1 staff to be there to hand out luggage?)  She found airport staff who said they couldn't help, but to come back on Friday the 5th at 9am or 2pm when Allegiant had a flight and therefore staff. Turns out there was no flight in the afternoon, but we were lucky and we stumbled onto that fact, no thanks to Allegiant, so she went in the morning. Why couldn't Allegiant take action to at least communicate? To deliver the baggage would have been even more helpful, even it was for a fee. Why not use the system which knows she checked a bag? Why didn't someone the night of the Arrival come tell the passengers ""we had an accident, we are short staffed, Allegiant doesn't offer services (or care) so come back when we have a flight so that you can stand in line and have an agent help you get your luggage that we will hang on to for 2 days and have you at our convenience come get it, taking a chance on when you arrive because we don't communicate because walking to the waiting customers or sending an email or text is too expensive. Please let me know what happened, and why.  I tried contacting Allegiant but they won't answer via phone nor email.",-1
2023-01-14,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Phoenix,,,,,,1.0,3,"extremely frustrating experience"" ",True,"  I had an extremely frustrating experience with Allegiant's customer service and refund process. After I could not check my bag 45 minutes before my flight, thus not being able to board, I spent hours on the phone trying to reach a representative to assist me with an insurance refund. When I finally got through, the customer service agent was unhelpful and dismissive, offering little to no assistance. Furthermore, when I requested a refund, I was told I needed to cancel my flight an hour before takeoff. If I knew I could not check my bag 45 minutes before the flight, I would have done so. Overall, the customer service and refund process provided by Allegiant was utterly unsatisfactory, and I will not be choosing to fly with you in the future.",-1
2023-01-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Arizona to Sioux Falls,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Allegiant will not help with anything,False,"  Allegiant ended up cancelling the flight for my son and his girlfriend to fly back to school due to weather. Allegiant customer service informed them that they will not be rescheduling the flight and they would have to travel to Vegas or Arizona to get a flight instead. Now we all understand that weather can cause these issues but after taking with customer service they informed them that they will not help with a rental or flying my son to either Vegas or Arizona. I spoke to a manager after learning what they told my son and she came on the phone really aggressive and just straight told me that Allegiant will not do anything to help them and they will refund our money. But at this time the cost to get a new ticket is 3 times as much as what they are going to refund us. When I informed her of all extra costs, extra stay, and now a rental car to drive to Arizona, she told me that that is all on us and Allegiant will not help with anything. Then I asked her if she would be ok if her kids were stranded somewhere and their airlines wouldn’t help them. She then got really hostile and and tried to hang up. We have flown them a few times but I can assure you that me nor anyone in my family will fly them again. We have 3 kids in college that play sports and we fly a lot. Allegiant will never be getting our business again. I can’t believe the way their customer service was and they were not willing to help at all after leaving a plane full of passengers stranded in California with their only option to book a new flight out of Vegas or Arizona all in their own dime.",-1
2023-01-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dulles to Austin,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,I will never fly with this airline again!,True," The Allegiant employees at the check-in counter at Dulles held me up by forcing me to check my carry-on suitcase. It's the same standard sized suitcase made for overhead bins that I've taken with me on many flights without any prior issues. However it was slightly too thick to fit all the way into a suspiciously skinny test bracket they have fixed to the ground beside the counter, so they forced me to pay extra and check it in. This hassle also delayed me from getting through airport security, but I went along without complaining. After I arrived at the gate, I discovered that the plane had left the terminal about 10 minutes earlier than its scheduled time! Two other passengers missed the flight as well. I called the airline and asked for a refund of the return portion of my itinerary and they refused! And that was after I had been assured by an Allegiant employee at the gate counter that a partial refund would be issued. I will never fly with this airline again! They lie to and rip off customers!",-1

Allegiant charged me, sent me confirmation but the hotel did not have the confirmation and basically I was left no hotel and had to rebook directly from the hotel. I called Allegiant the day of and was on hold 3.5 hours since this was the day I flying I could not stay on hold. I have emailed them but have not heard back. Their chat is unavailable.  My flight was fine and I was able to confirm but if you want a package do not book it with them",-1

Upon calling Allegiant air's customer service via phone we were told not to worry and that the flight would be refunded due to the cancelation, they then informed us that due to our approval to divert the flight to another airport while the flight was going on they would not be refunding any of the cancelation and each member flying would get a 50 dollar credit, this is the kind of bare bones airline I couldn't recommend to anyone and can't still imagine how they are still in business, stay away at all cost/they stranded my family.",-1

They are cheap, and I will give them that, however on many occasions over the years of flying that I have done with them I realize that they are more trouble than they are worth. They delay the flights often for many hours (this has happened on multiple occasions), charge you for a change in flight date, and charge you if you cancel a flight after 24 hours for a lot of money. Their flight attendants at times are not on time or they are poorly managed. There are many issues that I have personally witnessed and I am unhappy with the service I have received from them.",-1
2023-01-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Bloomington to Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never disappoint at being a disappointment,False," Absolute garbage of an airline. Not once have I ever been on a flight with Allegiant that has been departed on time. I learned my lesson a long time ago, but this trip was booked by my parents who swear “it’s not that bad”. Imagine my surprise when we get a text notification as we are walking into the airport that we are looking at a 2.5hr delay. Great news with two senior citizens and two kids under the age of 11 and one toddler. After looking at FlightAware I found that this was a rolling delay that had been hours in the making. This notification could have been sent out hours before just like any other airline notifies their customers. So, now we are sitting at a small regional airport for more than two additional hours with small children with an ETA of 1AM. Ideal situation. Upon arrival we were told that our baggage would delivered to carousel 3 but instead it was a delivered to carousel 6 (in another building). This was only after entire A320 worth of passengers with screaming tired children waited for over an hour. Our return trip was no different. We arrived to Sanford to be treated by a departure board showing 22/32 flights delayed. Three gate changes one plane change after boarding, three hours of waiting we board our “new” plane. Just like any terrible infomercial, “but wait there’s more”! After boarding we waited over an hour for them to load the baggage. I don’t know who thought loading everyone onto a plane with 10 children under the age of two BEFORE the baggage was a good idea after more than a two hour delay, but they need to find a new line of work where common sense and consideration are not necessary. Allegiant, you never disappoint at being a disappointment. I guess someone has to be at the bottom.",-1

Both my flights on my round trip was delayed by at least 3 hous, my first departure was delayed by 6 hours. Staff was very unhelpful and unsympathetic to any of the problems that occurred, and seemed irritated when all the fault was on them. They loaded a total of 15 bags on my return flight, and sent the rest to God knows where, and sent the flight off anyway. Instead of fixing or helping the whole rest of the customers they seriously inconvenienced, left typed instructions with a pile of papers saying write down your problems and we will deal with them later.

2022-12-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Missoula to Missoula via Missoula,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Horrible customer service,True," I've flown Allegiant multiple times and I'm at my last straw. Horrible customer service and weak flight cancellation excuses are reasons my family will never fly them again. I had a flight cancelled last spring with little notice due to not having enough pilots (they used covid as an excuse but the real reason was there wasn't enough people on the flight). I was forced to rebook thru Delta for $2000 more due to the late timing. Allegiant did nothing to help offset the cost or make it right. Even after waiting on hold to talk to a manager for 2.5 hours. I had another flight scheduled to take off tomorrow 12-24-22 and I received a text this morning saying my flight has been cancelled due to weather. The weather tomorrow is in the 40s and Mesa is in the 60s PLUS the other airlines are still flying. After waiting on hold for 2 hours, there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager and she said sorry, I would need to call a different number and easier on hold again. Terrible company! Just spend a little more and go with a real airline!",-1

They just announced there is too much fuel on the airplane to take off. They are going to remove the fuel and fly to Tulsa and get more fuel but they don’t know if they can find another flight crew to complete the trip to Florida. Just spoke to the pilot who said the previous announcements were false. The pilot said he will fly the leg to Florida but the plane will have to stop for fuel in Tulsa. This is complete mismanagement. Planes have to calculate total weight with fuel and passengers.,-1

I am military and my family hasn’t all been together in over 5 years. Less than 24 hours before our scheduled flight. Allegiant canceled our flight, no explanation. Looking for next day tickets is a fortune and now we are driving 21 hours to make this family reunion a reality. What was suppose to be a convenient and quick trip has turned into 40+ hour road trip and less time with family over Christmas because now I have to leave a day earlier to accommodate driving.

2022-12-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Provo,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,not very customer friendly,False,"  Truly it is not very customer friendly to fly Allegiant. My flight was delayed from 7pm to 12:50pm and there was no sort of refund at all. Also another time they flew above the Provo Utah airport and decided not to land even though they could have (I may add though they were worried about potential ice) and took us straight back to Mesa AZ. They then gave us a flight to Ogden the next day. I believe that there is a much better way to administrate this airline and be more respectful to customers. It is cheap, but it is to the point where it may be more worth it going on American, Delta, or anything else.",-1

We found out our flight was delayed 9+hours exactly 1.5 hours before take-off. When we went to contact customer service, we were on the phone for 3+ hours and no one responded. They gave me a voucher for this trip since we wound up having to fly on a different more reliable airline. When I went to use the voucher, it wouldn’t work and I contacted customer service with no response for 2+ weeks. I contacted them again and they told me my voucher had been voided. They would not even hear my side of the story and responded with “this is the last time we will reply in regards to this matter.” I can’t believe this airline treats their customers like this. I’m out 200$ now not including the price of the new flight, food, books, etc we had to buy while waiting at the airport.",-1

Our flight was originally suppose to leave at 4:00 but was delayed due to some reason that was never made clear. After hours of waiting, there was another flight scheduled to leave for this same route at 6:48, but instead of putting us on that plane like they should’ve done since we’d already been waiting for several hours, they let the original passengers take flight, while making us wait for our plane to arrive. Our plane finally arrives and we board the plane around 7:10. After waiting for about an hour to take off, the pilot informs us that the vehicle that was supposed to taxi the plane won’t start and we’ll have to get off the plane until they can “formulate a solution” really? They only have 1 vehicle that can taxi the plane in the whole freaking airport? So that brings us to now, it’s currently about 8:30 and we are all sitting here with no idea what’s going to happen. Allegiants management is terrible, communication is subpar l, and I will drive the 10 hours it takes to get before I fly with this lousy airline again. 0/10 for me.",-1
2022-12-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Mesa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,scores minus zero in my book,False," I was not able to actually take the trip for the ticket I purchased. According Allegiant's website, changes would be easy to make if necessary and only required a $25 fee. I attempted to make changes on Thanksgiving Day and could not reach them by phone, email, or the chat feature on their website. Hold times were in excess of 3 hours. Understanding this is the case during the holidays, I kept trying to reach them until I finally reached someone 4 days later by setting my alarm to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. so that I could call them. At this point, I was outside of the 7-day window, but tried to explain to the representative that I'd been trying to reach someone well before the 7-day advance notice requirement for changes. The key word here is that I ""tried"" to explain. The representative I spoke to was the rudest person I think I've ever reached in a customer service department. She kept cutting me off and reciting what sounded like a script that she was reading off of her computer screen. By the time she was finished listing all of the applicable fees, she said my $200 ticket was really only worth $23. I asked to speak to a supervisor and again attempted to explain the extenuating circumstances under which I needed to make a change, but she continued to rudely cut me off mid-sentence. Finally I was so angry I just hung up the phone. The airline needs to anticipate high call volume around holidays and still provide a means of communication with its customers. I was assured by the website that my email would receive a response within 24 to 48 hours, but now almost 2 weeks later I still haven't heard from anyone. They should also train their phone representatives to have some common courtesy and allow customers to speak and not treat everyone as if they're stupid. Let me also add I actually drove 45 minutes to the airport to speak to a representative in person, but there was not one single Allegiant employee at the airport that I could speak to. Overall, this airline scores minus zero in my book!",-1

The ticket agent who checked our bag for the flight down was incredibly rude and tried to bully us into paying 50 for my carry on saying it wouldn’t fit under the seat and threatened it would be 80 at the gate. My bag was smaller than many on the plane. Ended up being fine but she added a lot of stress and irritation to the flight down. Also their bag weight is 10 lbs less than almost every other airline in an effort to squeeze more money out of the passengers who are already flying this airline due to limited funds. On the flight home over thanksgiving weekend we arrived 3 hrs before boarding to reduce stress and ensure no issues getting on the flight. We waited in line for 30 minutes only to be told they would not take our bags until 2 hrs prior to check in. All other airlines are 4 hrs. I was uncomfortable with this and asked about the long line at security as well as boarding being so early and doors being closed 10 minutes before departure on way down. She said you can do priority bag check and the lines at security shouldn’t be that bad. So I am currently stuck outside security with no seats, no food or drinks and stressing out as I watch the security line hoping we can rush through in time to catch our flight. We certainly won’t have any time for dinner before our 8 pm flight so maybe it’s another way to make us spend money on the plane? Not sure but I am certain I will never fly this airline again.",-1

He tried to communicate with the desk representative and could not understand them. They did not have/were not prepared to deal with a deaf person. My son started to panic and contacted us because he did not know what to do. We had to get him a ride back to Lawrence Technical College and are still trying to figure out how to get him home. I guess the $200 they refunded us is supposed to take care of this mess. I've emailed them and I'm now on hold with them for over an hour. This company is really going downhill. I checked the weather at both airports and it's clear. Haven't been given a reason as to why it was canceled. If they can't provide the service then they shouldn't be selling tickets.

2022-11-01,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Orange County,2.0,,3.0,,,4.0,5,better than I expected,True,"  I flew from Austin to Orange County CA via Allegiant and had a seamless experience. After reading all the bad reviews, I was nervous, but it turns out, I was one of the lucky ones. My flight had a departure time of 1:50pm and the gate was in the south terminal, away from the main Austin terminal (about a 12 min drive to the other side). My flight started boarding at 1:05. TSA was easy to get through, although they do not have a separate line for TSA Precheck. After walking up the aircraft, I was surprised to see a spacious walking aisle and more legroom than I was expecting. The seats are stiff and do not recline, but you have lots of room for your legs in standard economy. I had a middle seat and was fine. Definitely bring your own entertainment as there is no Wi-Fi or movies available on board. Also, bring snacks and a refillable water bottle filled from the airport. For a $120 last minute ticket, this was better than I expected. We left and landed at the exact time listed. I would recommend.",1
2022-11-01,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Key West,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,making my flight an enjoyable experience,False,"  I booked my travel in March, for a trip to Key West. I was meeting my daughter there. I flew Indianapolis to Key West, she flew DCA-EYW. I had not seen her since January. I was so excited about reuniting. We had a wonderful time ! When I booked my reservation, I did not anticipate rotator cuff surgery. I was so concerned about being comfortable. I decided to research Allegiant. I was horrified at the amount of negative reviews. So on my departure I was a bit anxious. But I am here to say I had a wonderful experience. CSA and all the crew were so friendly and very helpful. I did not want to ask for help with my carryon, but the FA literally took my bag and put it in the overhead with a smile on her face. I was so grateful. My return flight went just as smooth. They even drove me to the aircraft to board first. Now everyone complained about the seats. They were not first class comfort, but I had no issues, my flight was 2.5 hrs. Would I want to do this on a flight more than 3 hrs, probably not. But I will definitely book on Allegiant when I meet my daughter again next year. Thank you for making my flight an enjoyable experience. (Even while wearing a sling). Happy flying everyone. I hope your experience goes as smoothly as mine did. (I did not have any delays, or cancellations). Thanks again Allegiant, and I will see you next year.",1
2022-10-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Book with a more reputable airline,False,"  First off if you choose to fly this airline you better have extra money and a back up plan because when I say they will leave you stranded somewhere and not care less, I mean it. This airline cancelled my flight back from Vegas at 4am without an explanation and zero help to get another flight. Refunded my money and told me to leave. Not their exact words but what happened. Luckily I was able to find a flight later on in the day to a town in my state (not the one I left from). I without a doubt I can say I will never fly this airline again unless they offer flights for about $50 and that's a big maybe. Because that's all this airline is worth $50 a flight (maybe). At the initial start of my journey the Allegiant Airport staff were just rude and condescending to everyone. It was a topic of discussion among passengers once we finally boarded. Enjoyed my trip until it was ready to fly out and my 6am flight was cancelled around 4am without explanation. Only as (former) customers can we stop using these airlines and stop giving them our money. Book with a more reputable airline for a few more bucks get treated better and have a more comfortable and roomier seat. For the extra $100 I should have chosen another airline (the one I flew back on). A lesson I will not forget.",-1
2022-10-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Billings to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never fly Allegiant again,True,"  Terrible experience. Even worse customer service. Instead of simply apologizing for the horrible experience we had the email (that took 3 months) said we aren’t required to do this and that. It’s how it goes basically. Delays, a horrible flight attendant nearly knocking us all down during boarding, and then that causing us all to get back off the plane and wait hours.  It is a cheap airline and you don’t even get your money worth at that. There was no safety issue. The email response that took months is a joke. I would have much rather had a simple apology. I will never fly Allegiant again. There are other discount airlines or I will pay more and go with an airline who treats their customers and employees well.",-1
2022-10-22,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Not worth your money,True,  Every single time I’ve flown with Allegiant the flight has been delayed at least an hour. That on top of expensive baggage fees (not letting you bring a carry on) and no in flight food available. The seats are also extremely uncomfortable. Not worth your money. Just buy a ticket that’s originally a bit more expensive because you’ll end up paying even more for Allegiant in both service fees and time.,-1
2022-10-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Billings to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,wait in a airport for 4-5 hours,False,  Keep the times that you had. Making people wait in a airport for 4-5 hours is not ok. People's time is worth to some people but to Allegiant Air it is not. Do better. This is exactly why everyone chooses anyone else.,-1
2022-10-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to Orlando,,,,,,3.0,1,worst company I've ever dealt with,False,"  Allegiant Air is the worst company I've ever dealt with in my life. I booked a ticket for myself to Orlando. A week later, my 14 year old daughter wanted to come to visit a friend of hers. I was unable to book her ticket on line because she is a child, and Allegiant won't allow a child to fly alone. I called their customer service and was on hold for four hours and 7 seven minutes after which I just hung up. The next day I went to the airport to speak with an agent in person. When I got there, there was no one there at the counter. Apparently they only show up two hours before a flight. How does one know when they will be there? Good question. Apparently you should check every destination that Allegiant flies to from your airport to see if there is a flight on that day/time so you know when to go there. Brilliant right? Someone at the Delta counter helped me out and told me when the next Allegiant flight would be that day and so I had to come back later. So I come back later that day,and wait on line. I get to the counter and explained my situation. The woman there said only that she couldn't help me and that I had to call customer service. I explained that it's physically impossible to reach a human when calling their customer service. She said she couldn't help me. I mean this very literally when I say that this woman could not have cared less or had any less interest in helping me solve my problem. Hands down the worst customer experience I've ever had with a company.",-1
2022-10-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Scott/MidAmerica,,,,,,,1,not offer a comparable flight/dates,True,"  I purchased two round trip tickets from Phx/Mesa airport to Belleville, IL airport departing 1/6/2023, returning 1/16/2023 to visit with my family post holidays. Since I knew we would be taking this flight, I purchased a non-refundable hotel ticket since 1/6 flight was early and we live 150+ miles away.  I was notified flight was canceled. Early October I tried to call but was on hold for over 30 minutes. I was on the phone 29 minutes - Allegiant advised me they refunded my flight; however, I explained the situation and requested hotel reimbursed. Supervisor refused any other compensation but said she could send me an email explaining the situation. Allegiant Air had my payment for over 2 months and could not offer a comparable flight/dates. Allegiant may have lower flight costs but not worth what I went through and lost $119.27 that will not be recouped.",-1
2022-10-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lexington to Orlando,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,delayed for 4.5 hours,True,  Flight #2910 from Kentucky to Sanford FL The flight was supposed to leave at 3:45 was delayed for 4.5 hours due to mechanical issues. For the last hour We where told they were waiting on a signature! That is absolutely absurd! They loaded the plane 2/3 thirds full and closed the doors. No one was allowed to get up and walk around for the first two hrs. There were kids on that plane. They didn't give us anything to even drink for hrs. I'm pretty sure the captain and crew weren't happy either. I never like flying and this confirms why.,-1
2022-10-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rapid city to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have ever flown,True,"  This is the worst airline I have ever flown. The staff are not friendly and accommodating. The flights are often times delayed. When we fly out from Vegas to rapid city It was delayed for one hour, and now it’s our return flight to Vegas we just got an announcement that our supposed flight of 6:19 pm to vegas will be delayed to 8:30 pm. What a joke.",-1
2022-10-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to North Carolina,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolute JOKE of a company,False," Didn't even make it to the flight because their system had an error that made it so our flight leaving was after our flight coming home. Spent $700 on the tickets and was told there is nothing they can do, I have to rebook on my own dime. Absolute JOKE of a company.",-1
2022-10-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Billings,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Poor service all around,False,  We were getting ready to leave Vegas when we were starting to take off they stopped on the runway for about 45 minutes. Everyone was getting hot and crabby and some were having a hard time breathing including my sister and I. They finally said that there was an issue with the screen and we will have to go back to the gates. We went back and continued to wait for another hour in an unbelievably hot plane. People were yelling and asking for air because it was so hard to breathe. At this point we were having full blown panic attack and they refused us water until my sister almost passed out and demanded it. This could’ve ended very badly. Such a poor airline and the people working didn’t care. I’m disgusted. If we got off the plane the next flight was 5 days after and we couldn’t have our bags. Poor service all around.,-1
2022-10-10,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Punta Gorda,,,,,,2.0,1,customer service is the worst,False,"  This is not my first encounter with Allegiant keeping my money. Last January 15 2021 flight 998 I came down with Covid and was unable to fly. I contacted Allegiant and held on the phone to talk to an agent for 5 1/2 hours for them to tell me they would not refund me I needed to give them 7 days notice how ridiculous I was sick. They keep $130.00 This year my friend and I planned a trip to Florida Thursday September 29- October 6 well we know what happened next Hurricane Ian. Allegiant notified us on Monday September 26, 9:04 pm our flight was canceled. We understand due to circumstance. I booked the reservation in a credit card that is a closed account. My husband went in and corrected the account number for the refund of $764.00 . Allegiant refund terms indicates it will be refunded with in 72 hours. It is now October 10 and no refund. I am currently waiting on hold to talk to an agent my hold time is 90 minutes? We will no longer flying with Allegiant. Their customer service is the worst, making people wait for hours on the phone. Keeping peoples money is still a crime.",-1
2022-10-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Peoria to Denver,3.0,,,,,1.0,1,Worst customer service experience,True,"  Had a flight out of Peoria to Denver on 10-7 of 2022 at 4:30 p.m. I showed up 2 hours early just like I was supposed to. Sat in the airport until 4:00 p.m. when they boarded us on a plane. Sat on the plane for an hour at the gate until they finally told us that one of the four flight attendants wasn't feeling well and they were going to deport the plane. Went back into the airport and sat for another hour until they finally came across the PA and told us the flight was canceled. Went home and got on the phone with Allegiant Air and sat on hold for another 2 hours until 9:30 p.m. to get my credit back, but when the lady finally got on the phone all she told me is there was an issue with the third party company that gives back the money and I could expect a call back in 6 to 8 weeks. Worst customer service experience of my 53 years. Do NOT book flights with these people. Pay the extra money and stick with American Airlines.",-1
2022-10-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,1,never fly with these guys again,False,"  Great airline if you have no plans and nowhere to be by a certain time! If you do, book 3 days ahead so you can get there by the time you need to be. But otherwise great for if you’re into casually taking a flight for no reason at all, and enjoy spending 7 extra hours in an airport. Complete insanity, will never fly with these guys again.",-1
2022-10-07,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fargo to Phoenix,3.0,,3.0,,,5.0,3,Worst customer service,True,"  Paid extra to sit in front. Really a budget airline but once you start adding the “options” the price can easily reach the price of the major air carriers. Still, they service some markets otherwise not readily available. No Wi-Fi, no entertainment, no food or beverage. Not certain the savings are worth it. Forget about customer service! Several ways to reach out to them on their website but consistently get “chat is unavailable”, “voicemail box is full”, “can’t take your call”, etc! Finally got through on phone and over 2 hr wait! Unbelievable. Maybe they should add $5 per passenger and improve their customer service. Great airline if you know what you’re getting (or not getting) AND everything goes off without a hitch, BUT if you need help, forget about it. Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced with any company.",-1
2022-10-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Pittsburgh,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,What a racket to take advantage of 80yr man,False, Nashville to Pittsburgh. My father booked a flight in May to fly 9/30/22 when he called to do his 24hrs check in system said canceled. He called and was on hold 1hr 45min on 9/29. He is 80yrs old - so he booked another flight triple price - now they say he is double booked and wants to give him a voucher for the first flight. He is 80 he wants his money back for the 2nd triple price flight because of there system. What a racket to take advantage of 80yr man.,-1
2022-10-05,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Pittsburgh,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,staff very hard to understand and rude,False, Jacksonville to Pittsburgh. I have flown Allegiant Air many times. This is the first time I had to cancel an Itinerary. I paid extra for something called Trip Flex. When I called to cancel I was connected using a terrible VOIP phone system with staff from another country that were very hard to understand and rude. I was told I would receive a credit good for travel until August of 2023 but not even a partial refund. I had included a rental car in my purchase. Not only did I have to pay for the entire flight but also for the rental car. The real surprise was when I was told I would be charged an additional $121.00 to cancel the reservations. This added insult to it all a credit but a fee to get the credit.,-1
2022-10-01,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Nashville,,,,,,,1,I can no longer use the promo code,True,"  Booked a flight and used a promo code I found on line. Forgot to use a voucher I had that was about to expire, so I canceled the flight 20 minutes later to rebook the same flight to apply my voucher. The agent told me I can no longer use the promo code since I ""already used it"". But I didn't use it. Waited on hold for a supervisor to say ""sorry that's just the way it works, we can't help you"". This flight was being used to help hurricane Ian refugees. That didn't mean anything to them either.",-1
2022-09-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,4hrs and still on hold,False,"  4hrs and still on hold. I don't care what's going on, this is completely unacceptable! Every flight I've ever been on with Allegiant has been delayed, postponed, or canceled. Once they even stranded my wife and I in Minneapolis by canceling the flight and using the planes to go to Allegiant field after a football game. Just left us there! Even if if costs more, use a different airline.",-1

After this round trip I can safely say I will never be flying Allegiant again. I can not and will never recommend Allegiant Air. Both my flights were delayed. My flight to Las Vegas was delayed by almost 2 hours. Completely ruining my plans for Thursday night. Then when leaving Las Vegas on Sunday my flight was delayed again by more then an hour. And now they need to do maintenance on the plane. I'm currently writing this stuck on the plane while they're doing maintenance. Why have everyone board the plane then do maintenance. Absolutely terrible planning. Plane was supposed to be leaving at 6.00pm. It's currently after 8.00pm and we're all still sitting on the plane with no estimated take off time. These seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat in. A concrete park bench is more comfortable. I've flown with other airlines and so far Allegiant Air has the worst seats. United seats are like recliners in comparison. Worst experience of my life and I've had a colonoscopy. Just pay the few extra dollars and fly with any other airline.,-1
2022-09-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to Mesa,2.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,"unprofessional and unsettling"" ",False,"  Our flight was cancelled, which is totally fine—that happens! However, how they handled it was terrible for the following reasons: The gate workers were blatantly laughing about the situation in front of us. Extremely unprofessional and unsettling. When I asked questions to the gate workers, they gave sassy answers and were, in my opinion, disrespectful. They were untruthful several times. The most flagrant was when the flight was cancelled at around 10pm they said we would receive an email in the morning about when the flight would leave. We had no idea what time the flight was leaving until we looked it up for ourselves in the app. I woke up at 4am waiting for the email but it never came. 4) They lowered our compensation for no reason. Allegiant was generous and gifted each traveler a certain amount of money for future flights. Then as soon as we left, Allegiant lowered the money we received by $50 and did not provide a reason for why. Ridiculous. Flight details: Provo to Mesa original depart time: 8:14pm original depart date: September 22, 2022 The complaints only apply to the gate workers on 9/22, but the gate workers the next day were fantastic",-1

2022-09-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Savannah to Akron,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the most horrible experience,False,"  It was the most horrible experience of my life. I am a retired Hispanic female. When I arrived to the Allegiant counter, I opened my app and had a notification that I was unable to check in through the app. I showed the notification to the female at the counter. The ""supervisor"" behind her informed me I had to go to the website and try again. Did I mention I'm retired. My tech skills are lacking. When I asked the supervisor if she could help me she said loudly ""your bag looks too large and if it doesn't fit in that box I need 50 dollars!"" I was traveling with my daughter who paid for a checked bag and a carry on. She only had a checked bag so we were good so I thought. With a large line behind me the two customer service females offered little to no assistance. I could have just fallen to the floor crying. I felt humiliated and ashamed for my poor tech skills. I thought about it all night. They were bullies. When my daughter and I arrived to the gate it was as if the females notified the female at the gate because I was targeted once again. She interrogated my daughter about my carry on.  I feel like I'll never get over this. It was the most horrible experience of my life.",-1
2022-09-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pasco to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,staff was extremely rude to me,False," Pasco to Los Angeles. On 07/24 I had a flight from Pasco to Los Angeles at 2:48 pm. At 1:15 I started the check-in online, tried to pay my luggage $21, twice and it showed a sign that said ""Unable to complete advanced Check-in"" Please see an allegiant airport check-in agent for assistance. I have the screenshot of it on my phone. I get to the airport at 1:30 and there is a huge line to do the check-in. By the time it's my turn, the girl at the counter wants to charge me $50 for my luggage and $5 for printing my ticket. I explained to her that I tried to print it and pay for my luggage and it told me to come to the counter. She said I needed to do it 1 hour before the flight, I show her the screenshot that I tried to do more than 1 hour before and that is not my fault that by the time I get here you have 50 minutes of waiting in line to get to the counter. She said right now she couldn't do anything. The staff was extremely rude to me and told me that I was wasting her time, that she needed to continue with the next customer, and started calling the next person while I wasn't even checked in. She said if I want to complain, call this phone number, 702 505 8888. She said ""you either leave the luggage here or you pay"". I paid out of desperation to get on that plane. I called that number 4 times, more than 2 hours of waiting time. When I finally can talk with someone, after waiting in line for 90 minutes, the person told me there is nothing they can do once I paid for my luggage at the counter, next time call them and they will add the luggage to my card if I'm having trouble. How do they expect me to communicate with you if you have 2 hours of waiting time during peak hours when my flight is leaving in less than 1? Nothing makes any sense. How am I supposed to be in the counter more than 1 hour before the flight if you have more than 1 hour of line? How am I supposed to call and ask for help if you have 2 hours of waiting time on the phone line? This is beyond ridiculous. I know I took a low-budget airline and for that, I had to pay for my luggage, I'm not trying to pay, I just want to have the extra money that I paid back. I put my card twice to pay for $21 dollar luggage, and they charged me $50. I tried to print/download my boarding pass, they charged me $5. I would like to have a refund of my $34. Since I haven't received an answer for more than 6 weeks, I contacted them by chat and they kept sending me their policy of non-refundable page, and get me disconnected twice.",-1
2022-09-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Nashville,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never be flying with this airline again,True,"  I had a flight 3 months ago GR MI to Nashville TN. they delayed the flight a lot during the day and kept doing so until about 11pm and as everyone is commenting over the intercom that we are going to Nashville over and over again -  they so casually cancel it. So unprofessional, so careless, and disrespectful. Just cancel it after the delays hours before because you obviously knew you weren't going to do the flight. Things were promised after, 72 hours after,  but to no ones surprise things haven't happened the way promised. 200 dollar vouchers promised per flight, I had 2 under my card info and I have reach out countless of times through phone, email, chat and course no answers.  I received one over a month after ... and still waiting on the other 200 dollar voucher. I had to travel to Nashville regardless for work related things and so my friends and I rented a car, thinking great the money to help will be there but no. They have 0 concern.  I will never be flying with this airline again. who cares if its cheap .. later on ends up costing you more anyways and also they just are a joke.",-1
2022-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Portland,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,The woman became very rude,True,"  When they just boarded, they left her squished with both boys, & her service dog in row 18, instead of moving her like like she was told. She's a Bernese mountain dog who is 125lbs that they have smooshed in there. The woman at the ticket counter was beyond rude to all of us regarding my sister's service dog. She flipped out, because supposedly they didn't get some email from her ""48hrs prior to boarding."" Although they could see everything in the computer, minus this 1 form that she obviously knows to carry with her anyways. The woman rudely asked her, well did you send in everything like it asks? Email, & all? She said yes. The woman became very rude, & said she had to call customer service to help her, & to step aside so she could help others until she got in touch with them. Mind you this whole time it's making the line stare at us, as she shuffled us from counter to counter. Then she asked for  papers as she has to send a copy to someone. While waiting for the papers she asked her why she had the service dog. What tasks she needs R for. She explained stage 4 breast cancer, she helps me with x,y, and z. She looked at her funny, so she repeated it to her, & it wasn't because she didn't hear her. She legit looked at her, with this look of disbelief, & she repeated as this lady just stared at her. She then proceeded to tell the other person on the phone well the dog is huge, & she's just laying on the ground. Then she says to the woman on the phone, well all of her paperwork is in a plastic sleeve, I don't know why it's like that.  She's just shredding her about how she needs to be at Portland airport 48 hrs in advance to register R, for the trip back in 8 days, & the email she just sent went through without issues, so she didn't know why we had issues. Oh, & she couldn't do it while she is there when she gets off the plane. I said well if it's only an email she needs to be sent 48hrs in advance, can we have the email that you just used so it will be easier on her? She said no. She had to go to the airport in person 48hrs prior, or R could be denied! I said why can't she have an Allegiant email that works to be sure the paperwork is sent in? I explained that she's literally 1 hour 1 WAY to the airport. I explained that she physically cannot do that (as this was already very clearly insanely overwhelming), especially if all they need is an email. She then says ma'am are you flying today? I said no, I'm her sister, as well as one of her caregivers, & I really want to know why you're making her jump through extra hoops, when you just said it just needs an email. Well she put in the memo/notes of her return flight that's already booked through them that she HAS to come in person 48 hrs in advance, or the dog will be denied. She then said to me, well if you're not flying I've got a whole other line of people to help, & so have a good day. Oh yeah, & to top it off, their bag was between 41lbs, & 42lbs, & she made her take out 2lbs. Another person weighed his, it was over, and that was ok though.",-1

2022-08-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,business travel with this airline is risky at best,True,"  This particular flight was delayed for over 3 hours and when the plane finally arrived and the passengers unloaded - only then did they tell us our flight was cancelled - they did send a 200.00 apology but that does not do much when your family is waiting and days of plans need to be cancelled/rescheduled. The telephone agent that I waited 45 minutes for after the cancellation because I had a rental car and could not do that online, was rude- very rude! I understand she was probably having a rough day dealing with upset people but I had a rough day too and was not rude to her. I have had so may bad experiences with them lately and I have multiple friends/family that have experienced the same it is just a shame. This used to be a decent way to travel with direct flights and lower cost but the underlying 'costs' are just too much. Any business travel with this airline is risky at best.",-1
2022-08-22,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Denver,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,3,Do not book their bundle,False,"  Flight got cancelled a month in advance, no problem, call customer service, very sweet rep helped me greatly getting me a new booking and no additional costs. Just called again, hour and a half hold time, needing to adjust my car rental included in my bundle, rudest rep ever. I had to wait an hour for someone to be stuck up with me. I could barely hear her first off, she would randomly place me on hold as i had the speaker to my ear to understand her, so that was so kind of her to allow the hold music to blare into my ear with no warning. I had a question about costs on the rental with the bundle and what exactly im “saving”, instead she mouthed off “IF YOU READ THE EMAIL IN THE RED, IT TELLS YOU THE TOTAL COST ISNT INCLUDED, FEES ARE PAID AT THE RENTAL COMPANY”. I understand, i was needing a breakdown of why its still $550 plus $200 in fees at the rental company. When if i just book through the company it would be $530 altogether. Do not book their bundle, you aren't saving anything. You’re just going to get stuck with a rude representative telling you your dumb for not reading the red. When i did. I wasn’t hostile towards her, i understand the rude people these reps get over the phone, but there was absolutely no reason for her to have this tone with me and treat me as if i were stupid.",-1
2022-08-19,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Bellingham,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3,how unreasonably rude this woman was,False,  For some reason one of the Allegiant employees was going around the waiting area demanding to see everyone’s boarding passes then very rudely demanding to see how much baggage they were carrying on to the plane. I understand there are limitations in place and specific allowances for baggage so that was not the issue here. The issue was how unreasonably rude this woman was. When confronted by her I showed her that our family of four had the approved amount of luggage and that the extra piece was a medical device thus not part of baggage allowance. She was extremely rude about it. There was no reason to be as we were complying with her requests. She moved on and continued to be rude to the other waiting passengers. I mean you don’t expect much from a low budget airline like this but basic respect and courtesy.,-1
2022-08-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Knox to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst flight experience ever,False,"  Worst flight experience ever. Plane sat on the tarmac for almost an hour longer than it should because the stewardess felt the need to go down every single row and confirm that each passenger was in their assigned seats for a flight that wasn’t even fully booked. Empty window seat next to you? Too bad, you must sit in your assigned seat anyway. Then they did a front to back passenger head count, only they spent so long checking the seats that multiple passengers had gone to the bathroom. So they had to start over every time someone left. Even the pilot asked over the intercom if we were cleared to leave yet. Absolute disaster. No airline I have ever flown has obsessed over passenger head counts and assigned seats to the point that they delayed their own departure flight. The flight attendants either have a power complex or there is needlessly strict policy tried to their take off.",-1
2022-08-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Des Moines,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,very bad customer service,True,"  Very bad service, very bad customer service. Rude staff that will not assist you if you need help (Des Moines Iowa Airport). It is not just once but every time we have used Allegiant Air. I don't understand how you loose a luggage on a direct flight. Delayed flights, every time. Disappointment.",-1
2022-08-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fresno,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,overcharging for check-in bag,True,"  I have never been treated so horribly in my life. Two of the tickets and check-in crew were rude and disrespectful. The manager and staff at terminal 1 of the Las Vegas airport were mean, rude and disrespectful to me. I wonder how they sleep at night knowing how horribly they treat her passengers in addition to overcharging for check-in bag.",-1
2022-08-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a rude tone and ending downright nasty,False,"  Rude employees. Was told one thing in Florida, but the opposite happened once we landed in New York. How dare I question an employee where my bags were?! This individual interrupted me 3 times, never actually listened to my question. She just kept repeating herself, starting with a rude tone and ending downright nasty. It's an economy airline, and I've flown many times. I can deal with the tiny, cramped seats; the high cost of any in-flight food or beverage - including water!; the complete lack of onboard entertainment or Wi-Fi. The absolute least I expect from this airline is respectful employees, and they did not deliver.",-1
2022-08-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,by far the worst flight experience,True,"  This has been by far the worst flight experience I’ve ever had. I’ve flown with Spirit, American Airlines, & Delta throughout my life with little-no issues. My friends and I ended up waiting at the airport for 7 hours with no updated information on our flight. My friends and I were patiently waiting for absolutely nothing. This airline was only able to offer free water and pop for our troubles. Allegiant also offered cheaper vouchers to be used for the future, which is of absolutely no value to any of us since we’ll never use this company again. Despite this terrible event, we decided to attempt again in the morning as directed by the email. The flight was supposed to leave at 11 am and here my friends and I sit at the airport again with a possible time to leave at 12:30 pm when the plane was supposed to depart at 11 am. This situation is extremely unprofessional and does not know what is going on, what to do, or how to keep their word. I am baffled about the circumstances. 0/10 would recommend.",-1
2022-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Flint,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,lowest rating seems overly optimistic,True,"  Our original flight left 30 minutes early with no prior notice. Normally I would see this as a positive, except for the fact that I wasn’t on the plane. And they told me there was no way to rebook and there were no flights going into the area for another four days. Then I overheard someone getting on a flight to a very nearby city. I asked to get on that flight and thankfully got transferred after a long back-and-forth. That flight was then on track to leave 20 minutes early as well! However, the flight was eventually delayed after they realized they had put on 9000 pounds too much fuel. Then the computer crashed and we had to go back to the gate to get a paper copy of the release to fly with the extra weight. We are currently sitting on the tarmac. At this point we would probably be just as well off if we taxi down the expressway to our destination. The fact that I am limited to one star as a lowest rating seems overly optimistic on their part. What is less than one star?",-1

2022-08-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Punta Gorda,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,incredibly rude to their passengers,False,"  The Allegiant crew in Asheville that were loading passengers onto the plane were incredibly rude to their passengers. Our flight was delayed 2 hours and passengers were getting no reasoning on why it was delayed or what was happening. Many passengers went up to the Allegiant workers to get clarification on what was happening, and their responses were sickening. These female Allegiant workers were yelling at multiple passengers for asking simple questions. It was evident that the majority of passengers were confused and maybe addressing the situation could have been more efficient, rather than yelling in individuals' faces. These female workers represent the company a as a whole, and respecting passengers should be the number one priority. Watching these encounters first-hand made me realize the disrespect and rudeness that was created from the Allegiant workers. I am incredibly disgusted in this behavior and it has made me think differently about the airline as a whole. Yelling at passengers because they were expressing their confusion is completely uncalled for. Allegiant needs to realize how to treat their passengers, and once they do I will think about flying on this airline again.",-1

We left early to get there and get through security quickly and relax. Unfortunately Allegiant won't let you check in until exactly 2 hours before your flight. There was no self service kiosk either. The app is also hourly. So since were there more than 3 hours before the flight we were told to take a seat until 3.15. We do such and as we get closer people wait in line while most of us are seated. Before you know it the line is 40 prior deep as a group of college age kids let all their friends cut in line. I get to the counter visibly upset and she can see that. I say that I'll just keep my mouth shut and from point on I'm talked down to. Get there early is simply a waste of your time and to not Pittsburgh security is insane. I've been to bigger airports and somehow Pittsburgh TSA just can't seen to get it right. TSA are rude and just clueless half the time.,-1
2022-07-30,0.9,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Bellingham to Las Vegas,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,5,an excellent trip both ways,False, Bellingham to Las Vegas. Had an excellent trip both ways!

2022-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Knoxville,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1,Would not recommend this airline,False,"  Would not recommend this airline, as they are more worried about selling snacks than they are about kindness or human dignity. Flew in July 2022. We sat on the plane for 40 minutes before taking off. As soon as they starting selling drinks I tried to use the restroom (I was recently treated for cancer, had a transplant, and was on extensive medicine that often caused stomach problems). There were carts at both ends of the aisle, but neither cart was more than 2 rows into service. None of the 4 attendants were willing to let me through, even when I expressed that I could not wait. When I asked if they could just back up a few feet I was told “the cart is too heavy to lift”. I had to return to my seat and wait until they passed before rushing to the bathroom.  Only when I emerged crying did one attendant show any kind of pity and offer me a glass of ice. They never apologized in any way and in fact avoided making eye contact with me for the rest of the flight and while deplaning. In short, it was more important for them not to be inconvenienced by 6 feet that it was to show kindness.",-1
2022-07-30,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Asheville to Melbourne,,,,,,1.0,1,seek alternate transportation,False,"  I reluctantly booked a flight from Asheville North Carolina back to Melbourne Florida in spite of all of the negative reviews about this airline, A few days before our flight tried to contact Allegiant customer service as many times as you can imagine even up to 2 o'clock in the morning and nobody answers! Got on their website and left them a request to contact me regarding a change in flight schedule. Other than an automated email response never received any communication from allegiant air. We stopped by the ticket counter in Asheville North Carolina and was met by two ticket agents one on both sides of the counter staring into their computers and waited in line was absolutely nobody else in the terminal without being recognized or spoken to. I finally said hi and asked who would can help me please? Neither Agent spoke or motion for me to come forward they just stared at me with literally angry faces. I walked up to the female agent and said hello and related my story of needing to change our schedule flight. The male Angry agent said in a very stern manner we cannot change your itinerary you must call customer service! Related the fact that I've been trying to get through to Customer service many many times by phone and email and had no response so we decided to drive out of our way and hopefully get assistance at the ticket counter. The female agent explained in the most unfriendly manner That she couldn't help me just call Customer service. I replied if I can't get through to customer service can't you help me at all with the change of schedules and the mail customer service agent said once again we can't change your itinerary in an angry manner at which point we exchanged a few final words and he blurted out that they do not work for Allegiant Air they are just contractors working as ticket agents for Allegiant!  Either way they didn't change our schedule and we were out $800 for our flight. We did not choose Allegiant to save money although it was the only convenient way to airline to Melbourne Florida. My strong advice is to seek alternate transportation elsewhere because if this is the way customer service is conducted at allegiant airways you're sincerely making a mistake.",-1
2022-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Nashville to Bozeman,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2,I was chased down and told to return for my checked bag,True," Due to my wife’s flight on another flight with Delta and the fact that we had to return our car rental earlier in the day, I arrived at BNA airport 4 hours and 15 minutes early for my flight. I checked in online and stood in line to check my bag. I completed the check in process/checked bag and as I was walking towards security, I was chased down and told to return for my checked bag because I was too early. I was told to return to check my bag in 2 hours and 15 minutes, so now I am sitting on a bench in the baggage claim. Every other airline that I have flown with has allowed me to check in early, but not Allegiant. Now I am unable to walk my wife to her gate and shop the airport as I had planned. Absolutely ridiculous.",-1
2022-07-29,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portsmouth to St Pete Clearwater,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Fly another carrier,False,"  Worst Airline for online booking, for hidden fees, for website ease of use, for customer service, and for customer assistance. A flight to FL which looks like on line it would be under $150 was $400 after all the fees they charge, on top of the fees they charge.  This airline is not an economic good choice. Everything is extra, even if you don't want to pay for seat selection, you pay for seat selection. You walk across the tarmac to deplane and board in FL, there is no water on flight unless you pay for it. Changing flights is a nightmare. No credit was issued when I changed a flight and I was charged more for a flight that cost less. I waited on line for 4 hours to talk to someone profoundly disinterested in customer service. The plane was comfortable and it was an easy board. I don't think that is worth the agony and time spent trying to get the reservation and then get a credit for a cancelled flight, another rip off. Fly another carrier, it will be cheaper and easier.",-1
2022-07-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Austin,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst customer service,True," Las Vegas to Austin. In the hundreds of flights I’ve taken during my lifetime, this was the worst experience I’ve ever had with any airline. This returning flight home was delayed 24 hours for “maintenance issues”. Never have I been on a plane that has been delayed that long for any reason, weather or otherwise. The Allegiant staff at the Las Vegas airport are truly doing the bare minimum with no regard for your schedule and had no urgency to try and get us on another flight. Their voucher won’t even cover a hotel room for tonight - not to mention the extra day of work myself and my friends are now having to forego because of this. Truly ridiculous. Going on hour 12 of being stuck at the Vegas airport. Truly the worst airline, worst customer service, and worst flying experience you will ever go through if you choose Allegiant.",-1
2022-07-25,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Greenville, SC to St. Petersburg, FL",3.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4,more concerned about the money to be made,True,"  I have flown with Allegiant several times in the past and typically have no issues with them. However, when it comes to making flight adjustments, if I could give them less than 1 star, I would. The first time I needed to make an adjustment back in 2020, my fiancé was having major back surgery that got moved up at the last minute. For that reason, I needed to cancel my flight and drive up a couple of days early to make it in time for the surgery. I bought the trip protection, and they informed me that my situation did not ""qualify"" for the refund. Never saw a cent of my ""protected"" flight. More recently, we had a flight scheduled but had a last minute COVID-19 exposure (my roommate tested positive for COVID the day of the flight). When I contacted support, they proceeded to tell me to show up for my flight as scheduled and that if I was not positive, they did not care who I had come into contact with (more specifically, that ""we come into contact with asymptomatic covid positive people everyday""). I made the conscious decision to miss the flight (without any form of refund), because I could not knowingly put other people in harms way. Ultimately, this came across to me as being more concerned about the money to be made, than the other passengers well being. Respect was lost after this experience.",-1
2022-07-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Pittsburgh,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,Rude flight attendants,True,"  Rude flight attendants. I did not want to place my personal bag on the floor under the seat. Had my son place in overhead bin. Flight attendants said I could not. I explained and showed them the food crumbs and debris On the floor. They were nasty to me telling me the floor was clean. Threatening to Have a rep come on board to talk to me and basically escort me off. So they let me leave it in the overhead but came back 5 minutes later to poke me again about it. Totally made a scene. Bottom line if the floor was clean as it should, we would never of had the conversation. But you get what you pay for. Discount airline, discount customer service.",-1

I wish I could give less than 1 star review. We are a stranded family of 5 from Greensboro, NC. Our Flight was delayed for 2 hours and then flight was canceled, no explanation! Their Business model is completely dysfunctional, it doesn’t provide passengers with any options and or any way to get home. An 1.5 hour canceled flight cost my family an extra $1,000 dollars on a rental car, a hotel room and a day wasted driving to NC. Thanks for the headaches! Allegiant is the absolute worst airline in the industry. I’ll go through life telling everyone I meet the same thing!",-1

The flight to and from Florida totally disappointed. On our flight down we were delayed 3 hours. The airplane breaks caught on fire when we landed. The flight home was delayed 4 hours and at 10.00 pm it was canceled. We were stranded in Punta Gorda! The Airline announce it canceled the flight and basically you’re on your own on. We were stuck trying to figure out how to get home, we had to catch an Uber and take it to Tampa’s airport. Cost 500.00 dollars. There were 5 of us. Luckily we found a flight with Frontier Airlines. Their customer service also gets a zero. It’s better to pay the extra money with a decent airline.",-1
2022-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Grand Rapids,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,cancelation right at boarding time,True,"  This is unacceptable. The cancelation right at boarding time, the fact I'm still on hold with customer service after 2 hours and 21 minutes. Just how bad is this company messing up to have that long of a hold time? $200? And when will we actually get that? Not in time. How is that going to pay for lodging and a ticket the next day? I needed that flight to leave asap. Time is of the essence. Allegiant doesn't fly out on Fridays from BNA. The next earliest flight is $400. My family and I have spent thousands of dollars with you guys. Never again.  Shame on this company.",-1
2022-07-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Lexington,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,do not use a budget friendly airline,True,"  I live in central KY and planned a cruise leaving from Miami so I decided to use Allegiant Air to get me there. Within 40 minutes of departure on a Friday evening, they cancelled the flight! I had a room booked in Miami for that evening, so i lost that money. But the cost of finding a new flight was where the losses really began to incur. I spoke with a customer service rep who hung up on me after telling me the flight was only delayed, not cancelled. i called him back twice and he offered no help, only insisted the flight was delayed. The cost of booking 2 tickets last minute with another airline to get me to Miami was nearly $2000. I had no choice! Allegiant did refund my tickets, just under $500 and gave me an additional $200, but that does not even touch how expensive the other plane tickets were. I suggest do not use a 'budget friendly' airline, the chaos at the airport is not worth it. They did not allow me to check in when i arrived at the airport upon my return, they actually moved me out of line twice. Once checked in, the flight was delayed twice and I missed my ride at my home airport by 45 minutes.",-1
2022-07-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sarasota to Boston,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,Allegiant Air was an absolutely horrible experience,False,"  As usual Allegiant Air was an absolutely horrible experience. The service is not too great, as much as my flights do usually take off on time you are almost guaranteed to wait over an hour after landing, because there is no available gate. They also really love to keep telling us the wait will be 10-15 minutes, when in reality I know it will be 60+ minutes. The only reason I actually keep flying with this terrible airline is because the tickets are dirt cheap and it is one of the only airlines that has the flight I need.",-1

I have to work and of course they don’t care. They do not refund your money, do not offer hotels or any help to pay for another day. I am losing a day at work due to the flight cancellation. Do not fly Allegiant, they are the worst airline.",-1
2022-07-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Nashville,,,,,,1.0,1,This was the most awful experience,True,"  This was the most awful experience I've ever had through an airline. I will never fly with Allegiant. They initially delayed our flight from 7:21 to 9:35. As soon as the incoming flight got off the plane, they canceled our flight to Nashville, without a reason. This was on a Thursday, I was going to a concert with my daughter on Friday and we were coming back on Sunday. Of course, there was no option to get on another flight bc they didn't fly again till Sunday. We missed our concert, I still had to pay for our tickets and our Airbnb. I'm still waiting for the money back for our flight.",-1
2022-07-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Knoxville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I’ll never fly with Allegiant,True," Newark to Knoxville. I've flown on 150+ international and domestic flights in my life, and this has never happened to me before. This is my second time flying with Allegiant and my 9:55am flight initially got delayed by 1h20min. Come time to board, they’ve just deplaned the previous flight and five minutes later, announced that there’s a mechanical issue so the flight got delayed from 11:20 to 2:40p. Around 1:30, they delay to 7:45, saying it could be as late as 9 that we board, with the potential for the flight to get cancelled as a whole. Now, it’s 10:05pm. No other communication and they keep pushing it back. We’re forced to wait here for total uncertainty. They won’t give us our money back unless they cancel the flight. All they gave us was an $8 meal voucher for a 13 hour delay - and the voucher doesn’t provide change. Use it on a $3 cup of coffee and it’s gone. People are unsure of whether to go home, stay at the airport, and even whether the flight is safe since this is a mechanical issue. They’ve told us absolutely nothing. No flights tomorrow for the same route. This is the worst flight experience I’ve ever had, and I’ll never fly with Allegiant Air again.",-1
2022-07-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they kept delaying planes for 3 hours,False,  The one trip we booked with them they kept delaying planes for 3 hours. This is completely ridiculous. I glad our plans didn't include something at our destination within that 3 hour time frame. I would rather pay exorbitant airfares on other airlines than to deal with this ever again. At least they didn't make us pay for the check in like they did coming out. They don't even give you complimentary water on a four hour flight. Nope you get to pay $3 per bottle just like if I bought it at the airport.,-1
2022-07-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Des Moines to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,They were impatient and no help at all,True,"  The worst airline to book, had a flight for today booked, I just added on a child on the phone and it turns out the lady changed the whole date of the flight without me knowing and nobody on the crew wanted to help me, they gave me their worst attitudes even though we were polite and tried to explain our situation. They were impatient and no help at all, they kept questioning our decisions and kept giving their personal views on it. I had proof that their side was wrong and I had emails stating that I was on this flight, and forwarded the email as they wanted to 10 times and it kept saying sent and they claimed that they never received it and didn't want to do anything, and I called directly to Allegiant when I made the child change no other 3rd party. I called customer service and 5 hours later and nothing, haven't talked to no one, and we don't know what to do.",-1
2022-07-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Allentown to Orlando,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,worst customer service experience ever,True,"  I had the worst customer service experience ever with with Allegiant Air. My partner and I tried to change flights due to a last minute emergency. We tried calling an agent who would not help or move our flights and honor our previous purchase. They were rude and could not explain what they were trying to do and just pushed us to customer service. The hold time to talk to anyone was 2+ hours. We called off a different phone and asked to speak to a supervisor or manager so we could just move our flights. We were not asking for refunds, or even any money back and we're willing to pay a difference due to how last minute it was. They didn't want to accommodate us, and were asking for us to basically book a whole new trip. No matter who I spoke to (all of which were outsourced agents and no one from the States) no one would help us out. We were forced to eat one passenger, and the other had to travel alone to not loose money. I will never fly Allegiant again, and would rather travel out of my way to another airport to fly with another airline.",-1
2022-07-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,El paso to Las Vegas,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,delayed our flight for 5 hours,False,  This company delayed our flight for 5 hours. Then they rescheduled our flight to the next day at 8:00 p.m. approximately 24 hours later. We were stranded in El Paso Texas for the evening. We had to purchase a flight with another airline company Southwest Airlines. We also have to purchase a hotel for the evening so we had a place to sleep. The next day we were getting more alerts saying that the next flight was being delayed further after we had even already canceled. On top of that before we keep it took this flight delayed our flight from 3:30 p.m. originally til10:40 p.m. this flight was supposed to fly July 10 2022. They do not have a sister company that they can switch you to. They will not offer you any emergency hotel stay.  Be sure to have extra money for a back up plan or it can get ugly.,-1

We fly allegiant regularly to Florida. This flight started out being delayed an hour and 19 minutes for boarding due to the pilots running out of flying hours and having to wait on new ones. After boarding it was almost another 30 mins before leaving. When we finally reached our destination we hovered for about 20-25 mins due to a storm. Finally it was decided to detour to Nashville 2 hours away from the original destination due to needing fuel. After landing for fuel and sitting on the Tarmac for almost 2 hrs we were told we would not be going to original destination and would either be staying in Nashville or going back to Florida. If anyone were to stay on the plane all checked luggage would go back to Florida as well. I was traveling with a 3 year old and a 7 year old with checked car seats. So I was forced to make sure everyone was getting off and checked bags would be staying in order to decide due to needing my car seats. There was absolutely no communication with this flight as to what was really going on and a 2 hour flight turned into a 5 hour ordeal and being left in a city 2 hours from where i was suppose to be. There was no compensation offered nor food or anything for that matter. It was after midnight when we finally got off this plane after being on it since 8ish and never even arrived at our destination. I am unsure that i will even use this airline again after the way this situation was handled because it was completely ridiculous.,-1
2022-07-09,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Flint via Mesa Airport to Bishop Airport,2.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,there is no solution to my problem,False,"  My flight was fine until they lost my 8 month old car seat. I gate checked my stroller and car seat at the gate and when I landed in Bishop airport they only had my stroller. How am I suppose to travel with a newborn baby without a car seat. I landed at 1.46 pm June 11th, I wasn't able to leave until 4pm. I was extremely tired and had no choice but to leave and hope I didn’t crash or get pull over with my child. I’ve contacted customer service, no luck with the phone number always busy. I’ve call Bishop and I was told it’s nothing they can do. I can’t afford another car seat. This is horrible and they have no regards for the safety of my child this is the worst thing I’ve had to deal with and it seems as there is no solution to my problem, I would not recommend this flight they don’t take care of your property.",-1
2022-07-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,impolite and unprofessional behavior,True,  The worst service I have ever received from an airline. They even did not give me a receipt for charging my luggage! I emailed them asking for receipts! The answer was that it would take 4-6 weeks! Very impolite and unprofessional behavior from Allegiant airline staff at the airport. I will never try that airline.,-1
2022-07-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Piedmont to St Pete Clearwater,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I wouldn’t recommend this company,True,"  Absolutely the worst airline we have ever flown with and the customer service is just as bad. We chose this company because they 'honor veterans and military'. After booking our flight in May to fly from GSO to PIE June 24th to return July 1, we realized military veterans and traveling family were 'supposed' to get free checked bags, we had 3. We emailed customer service with documentation twice. After a couple of weeks and no response my husband called the customer service, after holding almost 2 hours he was told we needed to show the military ID at the airport for verification and call back after our flight for a refund. June 24 rolls around, we get to the airport for almost 2 hours, they won’t take bags and we wait to hear if our flight is cancelled. Finally they allow us to check in at the desk and take our bags. As instructed my husband provided his veterans ID and the lady said we were all set. After several more delays we finally made it to PIE. July 1, our day to fly home we get a text message a couple of hours before our flight that it had been cancelled with no reason or rescheduling, we would receive a refund in 72 hours. There was not another flight out until July 4 so we were forced to drive 10 hours home. This morning 7/7 my husband called because we had not received any notice showing our refund and it wasn’t showing pending on our account and all record of the flight was removed from our app and online. After holding forever he spoke with a staff member who told him that the check in terminal did not do what they were supposed to in order to refund our baggage for military so we would not get a refund for the baggage on the flight there. She did after an extended hold, process the refund for our return cancelled flight. When asked why it wasn’t automatically refunded as our message said, she said the systems do not always process the refund. So if he didn’t call we would have never been refunded. This was our first experience flying with them and I wouldn’t recommend this company.",-1

If you don't checkin online, charge you $15 for boarding pass. My friend had a small drone case along with personal item. She had a checkin but didn't choose as all she had was a personal bag and a drone case. They initially asked to pay $50 for extra bag. Once she explained that she had checkin and didn't choose it, coz of the size. They still charged $15. I guess that's how they operate cheap flights=. Even the water is not free, you need to pay for it. Worst airline I ever flew.",-1

They moved our late morning honeymoon flight to the wee hours. They delayed my spring break trip. The trip we are supposed to leave on today has been delayed 4 times now. Mind you there are clear skies. I am livid! By the time they nickel and dime you, it’s not any cheaper either. Only book Allegiant if you want to start and finish your vacation with a headache!",-1

The flight was delayed by 2 hours causing us to miss our connecting flight. The supervisor told us the only accommodation they could offer is a referral letter that allows us to sleep on the airport floor. I really thought he was kidding, he was not, We we’re offered no other solution and told it states when we book that they are not responsible if their flights are delayed. As I mentioned, I cannot locate this info. I called their customer service line and waited on hold for 2 hours only to be told ""sorry there’s nothing we can do"". They offered nothing. In fact I don’t even remember them apologizing. Awful customer service. We missed our flight by 10 minutes.",-1

Return flight was also delayed.",-1
2022-06-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,So done with Allegiant,False,"  So done with Allegiant. They cancel your flights and give you vouchers, so you cannot schedule your own life. I used the vouchers for family members, but needed to make a change to the car reservation - have been on hold for 2 hours and 18 minutes. And be very careful of their car rentals - it appears that they are a bit less expensive but the fine print says there are no taxes or fees collected from them. So really they turned out to be more expensive than other sites. I so hope they don't cancel these next flights for my family, because if they do then I will be stuck with more vouchers. My husband has encouraged me to ignore them until they just expire. I guess that is the best course of action.",-1

2022-06-27,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Fort Walton Beach,3.0,,2.0,,,2.0,4,Disappointing customer service,False,"  Disappointing customer service. Flight was fine, travel was fine. Returned on an early evening flight and my luggage had been damaged. The handle had been damaged and I couldn't pull it up to use it. Stopped a nice man in the airport to try for me. Wasn't sure of the process to report it so I got online as soon as I got home and sent in a complaint within 8 hours. No response for weeks, sent another, no response. Left a message. Finally got a response telling me I didn't file my complaint timely because they had the recorded complaint down in June (my third attempt to contact them). Sad what has happened with customer service.",1

The flight was fine and on time, however when we landed in Flint it took 1 hour and 30-50 minutes to get our bags. No one was at the ticketing area to address our concerns and questions. In fact, no one was at ticketing to help customers arriving for a future flight. I was told by local personnel working at the airport that Allegiant hires young and inexperienced people who do not know how to manage others. Obviously there is also a staffing shortage at Flint airport.",1
2022-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Little Rock,,,,,,1.0,1,Never again will I fly Allegiant Air,False,"  Allegiant cancelled flight while waiting in line at the airport. No notice, no assistance with rescheduling, no full refund. Only option offered was a Flight 3 days later. Or a 1/2 refund because we could fly out on a flight 2 hours away with Allegiant. Let me add there was no guarantee that either flight would leave as scheduled. Never again will I fly Allegiant Air.",-1

Took me an hour and a half to make it in the building only to wait in line. Get pulled from line for last call to Bozeman Montana just to check in and told I have to pay $200 more right now or I can move it to Thursday. When I said let's move it to Thursday they then said I had to pay all over again. So they just made $400+ for free. I didn't have the money to pay. So now stuck in Vegas and my phone dies. Not even a half hour after all this I'm trying to figure it all out when a security guard approached me asking for proof of a ticket and since it's on my phone I couldn't show him. He tells me to leave the airport. I'm outside trying to figure it out when an hour later I decide to go to the other side and see who could help. When entering the building I'm being paged over intercom which you couldn't hear outside to pick up phone and dial 0. So I do and my daughter bought me a new ticket. Had to find charger to get proof. Once I do ticket is for thee next day and I had nowhere to go. I was not refunded a penny and it was the most miserable experience I have had in my 40 years of life I will never ever recommend this airline or airport for any reason. I would rather travel by buss than to ever deal with the rudeness of this airport and airline ever again.",-1
2022-06-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fargo to Los Angeles,,,,,,1.0,1,Just the worst experience,True,  Just the worst experience. They cancelled the flight per email. Could not reach them by phone. Had to re-arrange everything by myself. No empathy. Would never try and fly with them again.,-1
2022-06-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Punta Gorda,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Will never use this airline again,False,"  The worst airline ever. If something goes wrong with baggage or flight (delay or cancellation) be prepared to figure it out yourself because this airline has no credible, willing employees who can assist you. The telephonic customer service is non-existent. I was on hold for 4 hours after flight was cancelled--and no one ever answered the phone. Had to make hotel, transport and flight reservations back home on another airline by myself and I also absorbed all the extra cost of doing that. Allegiant refused to pay. Will never use this airline again.",-1
2022-06-22,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Harrisburg,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,they seriously go above on beyond to accommodate you,False,  My husband and I booked with Allegiant Air from Nashville to Harrisburg PA. I was furious when 10 min before our arrival to Nashville we were notified the flight was cancelled. I couldn’t believe it so we had to find a last min flight with different airline. Allegiant cancelling flight at last min was annoying and inconvenient. Since that flight cancelled these people have gone so far above and beyond to apologize and make it right the best they could. Including refunding our money giving us a flight credit and then sending us funds for our inconvenience! Please know they may be a smaller airline but if they have to cancel or make a change they seriously go above on beyond to accommodate you. I’m super impressed!,1
2022-06-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Allentown to Sanford,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,You’re better off walking,False,  You’re better off walking. Used Allegiant 4 times. 3 of 4 were delayed by more than 3 hours. Zero stars. This has to be the worst airline since the Wright brothers invented flying.,-1
2022-06-19,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Peoria to Destin Fort Walton Beach,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,2,don't recommend this airline,False,"  First and last experience with Allegiant Air. My return flight home for my two girls and I got canceled, we rescheduled and it got canceled again with no explanation, couldn't get through to anyone, not even a robot as the so called customer service # was either busy or not available. And forget getting any email response as I didn't. I missed more days of work, had to get a ride home which was very inconvenient with unexpected expenses with gas, food, hotel ... roads were full of delays with construction, drove about 8+ hours to hotel for rest and another 8 hours the next day, home at last! Absolutely don't recommend this airline!",-1
2022-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Savannah,,,,,,1.0,1,worst travel experience for me,True,"  The worst travel experience for me ever. My whole family went to the airport with our boarding pass just to find out that our flight was canceled. The reason is simply because they don't have enough passenger on the plane and they will lose money if they fly. But what about my booked hotel, rental car, tours at the destination? We lost thousands of dollars, our precious vacation time and the time spent on researching the trip. Our vacation turned out to be just staying at home and being disappointed. When asked if it is possible for us to be on other flights to get to our destination, the answer is of course no, because they don't work with any other airlines. Needless to say I will never use Allegiant Air and this review is to help you to avoid such terrible airline so that you can enjoy your vacation.",-1
2022-06-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Greensboro to Florida,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,it has cheap prices for a reason,False,"  Allegiant Air canceled my flight in the last minute without any reasons. I tried to call their customer service but no one picked up, later on the phone was not even ringing. It was not because of bad weather or something. I tried to call and email later but no response at all. They just simply sent the email said the flight was canceled, not delayed, and it messed up my whole trip. We will never book our flights with Allegiant Air anymore, it has cheap prices for a reason. Very disappointed!",-1
2022-06-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Appleton to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"Terrible customer service"" ",True," Terrible customer service. Waited in line for over an hour for someone to even appear at check in/bag check. Employees were rude and unhelpful. There were many hidden costs. By the time all was said and done, we should have flown with a better airline. We didn’t end up actually saving any money, and it was a horrible experience. Do not fly this airline.",-1
2022-06-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St Petersburg to Key West,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,has no customer service,False,"  I can't even believe a company is in business that has no customer service. If you call their customer service number it doesn't work. If you click on the chat button on the website it says it's off line or not available, that leaves you to send them emails which they don't respond to. The airline cancelled my flight 3 hours before holiday weekend flight and just said ""sorry we couldn't fulfil our promise"". I've gotten no refund. So hard to imagine how a company can get away with charging for a flight. Cancelling it with no viable reason like weather, etc and then ignore customer and not give them their money back. I'd be so embarrassed if I represented this airline in any capacity.",-1
2022-06-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las vegas to Mesa/Phoenix,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,tries to Nickle and dime you on everything,True,"  Once again Allegiant has had another one of my flights either canceled or delayed more than two hours. In my last five trips using Allegiant one leg of each trip has been canceled or delayed. This airline continues to be a joke and even with cargo bins completely open the stewardess with still not allow you to put your personal item in the overhead bin this is after everyone has already boarded. Unfortunately this company tries to Nickle and dime you on everything and even their flights are not cheap anymore, but flying into ND seems the they are one of the only options. However if it's their screw up and has a 4+hour delay or even a cancelation they don't often allow any type of compensation and talking to a customer service representative will sometimes leave you on hold for 5+hours before you can even get through.",-1

Had to wait two hours to get our luggage and it wasn’t even loaded on a plane! Employees yelling at customers, was told that there was nothing they could do! No rebooking, no rental cars and no hotels! One agent specifically said “It’s not my problem”. Absolutely the worst Airport Experience I’ve ever had! I will never book through them again. I will pay the extra money through another airport with better service!!",-1
2022-06-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sanford/Orlando to Omaha,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no one cares to help or even care,False,"  We were on a family (12 people) vacation to Florida for a week. We got to our destination with little problems. One of our people needed to fly home early. We dropped him off in plenty of time to board his flight, which had already been delayed once. Later, his flight was delayed again, and then later canceled. Guest services did nothing to help him find a flight or figure out any other options. We ended up getting him a flight out of Orlando International Airport with a different airline (Delta). A few days later when 6 of us were headed to the airport at 3:30 am, we were notified that our flight was canceled. We opted to drive the 21 hours back home. We still received texts about the flight menu, on flight options, etc during our drive.We will never use this airline again. Too many issues and no one cares to help or even care!",-1
2022-06-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Savannah,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I was appalled. This is not customer service,True," It’s unreal to me what the airline industry has become and Allegiant is at the bottom of customer service. My flight was cancelled 30 mins prior to take-off after being delayed twice. Had it been cancelled earlier I would’ve had the whole day to drive to my 12 hour away destination which I already had to do. This cost me 2 days of my trip due to driving there and back, two nights in a hotel to stop during the drive, gas, time, heartache after a long anticipated vacation. This basically ruined it. After standing in line for a half hour after finding out my flight was cancelled, I was finally acknowledged by the gate agent that basically meandered around ignoring the huge line at her counter, I asked her to help me rebook my flight and she literally said “no, you can do that yourself on your mobile phone.” I was appalled. This is not customer service.",-1
2022-06-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"paid for garbage, received just that",True,"  Syracuse to Ft Lauderdale. Allegiant is quite possibly the worst airline in history. Our flight to Fort Lauderdale was canceled (we were notified late via text message), and rebooking took over 3 hours. Their customer “service” line never picked up after 2 hours on hold. The next day, the subsequent flight was delayed due to “maintenance” for over 2 hours. I have never had a worse passenger experience on an airline, and would urge anyone NOT to book with them regardless of how cheap their tickets are. Sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case, I paid for garbage and received just that.",-1

2022-06-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Provo,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,asked her if I'd be able to move,True,"  Years ago, I promise that I would never fly this horrible rotten excuse for an airline again. Unfortunately it's the only plane from Phoenix going to Provo utah. So I booked my ticket and got to the airport and got on the airplane after choosing My premium seat which cost an extra $15. When the plane was completely boarded, there were nine seats in front of me that had extra leg room and were by the exit doors. Two people had paid the upgrade to there and one of the people's friends stuck in and got the free upgraded seat. After the horrible flight attendant came up to give the speech about being able to open the doors and had to give a verbal reply, I asked her if I'd be able to move from my cramped seat to one of the empty seven seats that were more roomy. Seven empty seats and she said it would be $50. That's absolutely ridiculous. Why not just for a matter of good customer service say okay no problem.",-1
2022-06-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Punta Gorda,,,,,,1.0,1,I will never give them my business again,False,  Flight was cancelled within 30 minutes of departure. Apparently because a shortage of flight crew. They still flew the plane to its destination with nobody on it. This makes absolutely no sense. They did not offer a stay in a hotel or a connecting flight on another plane or airline. No electronic kiosks to get my ticket. Nobody at service desk to check bags. Customer service phone number gives a constant busy signal. This airline is complete garbage and I will never give them my business again.,-1
2022-06-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,would never book Allegiant again,False," Cincinnati to Las Vegas. I’ll start by saying if you google Allegiant there’s a reservation.com site that pops up as if they’re affiliated with Allegiant whole time they’re NOT! After trying to book my flight online 5 times my purpose of using google was to get Allegiant Air phone number to book by phone instead. I spoke with an agent who pulled all my info up as if he had access to the Allegiant screen. They repeated back to me the names of all the travelers so I was certain he was apart of Allegiant staff. So everything goes through and they requested that I covered all my numbers besides the last 4 on the card I booked with along with my drivers license. This was my first time booking a flight by phone so it didn’t seem odd because I assumed they just wanted to be sure I was the card holder for the card I was using. So I booked a flight for a total of 5 people and a mini van through Allegiant site but rental was with Enterprise. About a week before my trip I called Enterprise to get a rough estimate on how much the insurance through them would be. Enterprise informed me that they had no reservations with me but did see one that had just recently been cancelled so of course I freaked! Then I remember they agent had given me his personal direct line in case I had any questions or concerns. He goes to tell me I cannot contact Enterprise OR Allegiant whatsoever! He then goes to say that if I were to do so again, the $3,300 for flights and rental would result in a total loss! Mind you when I booked my three older aunts needed wheel chair service! When we got to the airport they saw nothing about wheel chair services! So that annoyed us all! we was also told that it would be no problem that my aunt had her oxygen tank and she could fly with it. The oxygen was confiscated by TSA! The flight was terrible! We were on a 4 hour flight and no snacks or beverages were issued out. This entire time I thought I was saving a ton by doing a bundle deal with flight and rental car only to arrive in Vegas to enterprise and get hit with a $200 fee BEFORE insurance charges! So Allegiant doesn’t tell you about the hidden fees that comes along with you thinking you’re getting a deal! You even have to pay $5 for boarding passes! Could you imagine doing so for flights you have layovers on so that’s an extra $5 on top of there was a couple whose boarding tickets didn’t work SIX times! So they went from TSA back to front desk 6 times and 7th it finally worked! I would never book Allegiant again! If I could give them 0 stars I would!",-1
2022-06-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sioux Falls to Orange County,,,,,,,1,I will never fly Allegiant again,False,"  Flew for a graduation left my 3 kids at home with grandma and this morning I get a text that the flight has been canceled with a link to my refund. I just got off the phone with Allegiant Air after a 2 hour wait on the phone to talk to a representative. I had to book the next available flight which was American Airlines for almost triple the price and upfront coast of over 1000$ I also have a rental car that I booked through them. They told me their next available flight is Friday because they only fly Mondays and Friday and that they do not offer expenses for rental cars or lodging and there max is refund is the ticket price and 200$ extra each ticket. They also told me the flight was not canceled due to weather etc but was just canceled. So here I am stuck in SD with out my kids unless I upfront 1000$ to get my wife and mother home late tonight. They were not apologetic and just said 200$ is there max and did not care that prices cost a ton to get a same day flight home or wait a week when they cover no costs, it feels illegal. I will never fly Allegiant again and will tell all my family to not fly them either. Does not matter that there ticket prices were cheaper because they dont actually fly and leave you stranded paying same day ticket prices desperate to get home to my kids and work.",-1
2022-06-04,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Savannah,3.0,,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,My last several flights with Allegiant were delayed,False,"  The app doesn't work to add your bags, and the airline is more than happy to charge far more at the airport. Customer service line is perpetually busy. I finally connected, was on hold for 2 hours, and they never picked up. This is how they ensure to overcharge you for your bags in both directions.

On 4-22-22 our return Flight from Tampa Fl was cancelled resulting in a $501.46 refund. It is 6/3/22 and I still have not received it. I have tried calling for a month and always a busy signal. When I finally got through, I waited 3 hours just to be disconnected. The staff at Flint Bishop Airport were beyond rude. You can feel their hatred of their jobs dripping form them. I have emailed also just to get an immediate reply that they received my email but if it is not about a flight within 48 hours they will get back to me in 4-6 weeks. I believe they are scamming the public. If they keep $500 of 1000 passengers money, they are making money on our money. The flight attendants made fun of people struggling trying to put their carry on in the overhead bin instead of helping them. Also made fun of people in wheel chairs. A far as their Honors Program for Veterans and Military, they don't honor their claim that they get priority seating. The scoffed at my husband when he showed his Veterans ID card. The plane was filthy. Do not use this airline. After this experience with inept staff, it's a wonder we made it back.",-1

No explanation and cant get ahold of anyone to reschedule me. Next flight I can find under 1000 bucks isnt until 3 days later. Refund is only a fraction of what I paid.

May 27, 2022 flight boarded and went out on tarmac, pilot turned plane around and went back to gate stating mechanical issues. Everyone got off plane and waited at gate area. 45 minutes later announced flight was canceled. Sister went to desk and advised refund since there wasn't another flight out until Monday the 30th which was the day she was to fly back home. She filled out paperwork to issue refund to my ccard. June 1st, 2022 a refund issued back to my ccard for 197.00 and of course you can not get thru to anyone on their customer service phone line and no online chat people available. Why did they only refund less than half of the ticket? did they think she was going to fly back to Michigan when she didnt have a flight to Florida? Absolutely ridiculous.",-1

The flight back was miserable. My husband got motion sickness and there was not any bags for him, he tried to go to the restroom and a flight attendant yelled at him and said to use the bag provided (still, no bag) so he had to grab one from a different passenger. She was extremely rude. Then once we landed we waiting over an hour (still waiting so let’s be real i don’t know how long exactly) for our baggage because they’re “short handed.” Really terrible service. Pretty pathetic.",-1

Not worth saving the money. There is absolutely no such thing as customer service with this airline. They lost my bags and after calling different numbers for about an hour, a woman told me that she hopes I will get my bag back and that she hopes they will contact me in the next 24 hours. I hope I get my bag back, too. The airline only has staff present in the airport when there is a flight, not one single staff member otherwise.",-1
2022-05-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,Absolute worst airline,False," Columbus to Orlando. Absolute worst airline on planet earth, don’t fly for any price unless you want to fear for your life, have any mental health condition spiked, arrive late, be mistreated by the flight crew and hear a credit card sales pitch for half-hour flight while you’re stuck in a seat you can’t get up from. This airline has been my way to visit my family in Florida from Ohio for 6 years and I can confidently say after over 20 flights, if I could have afforded to fly any other way I would have every single time. Now that I can, I will not be retiring to Allegiant. Always a rough take-off, flight; and landing. Always delays based on crew mistakes (today's issue is as the captain literally lost the logbook, ya know; like the one that lets him know if the plane is safe to fly or not?), we waited a half-hour until he “found it” and we took off for a flight in which passengers (complete strangers) literally held hands and prayed for a safe landing at our destination. This is one instance of this but is completely indicative of the trend I’ve experienced for years with this airline.",-1
2022-05-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Petersburg to Blue Grass,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"rude, uncaring, and I was horrified",True,"  I've submitted the same complaint to Allegient 3 times. The concern has not been addressed, and the only responses I've received are automated emails from customer relations. The purpose of the planned trip was to return to Clearwater, FL, where I was vacationing with my husband and our dog when my father’s health took a severe downturn. I traveled from PIE to LEX on Allegiant flight G4 1917 on Jan 30, 2002, leaving our dog behind with my husband. My father passed away a day after I arrived in Lexington, and my husband traveled from Clearwater, FL to Lexington, KY on Allegiant flight G4 1917 on Feb 10, 2022, along with our dog, to join family during a very difficult time. My husband returned to Clearwater on Allegiant on Feb 17, 2022. I was not allowed to board my return flight to Clearwater on Feb 20, 2022 with our dog because the pet carrier did not meet Allegiant size specifications. However, our dog had traveled from PIE to LEX with my husband in the very same pet carrier on Feb 10, 2022. Also, I purchased the pet carrier based on the fact that it was identical to a pet carrier that was on my Allegiant flight from PIE to LEX on Jan 30, 2022. The passenger with the in-cabin pet on my Jan 30, 2022 flight told me that she had flown from LEX to PIE using the same pet carrier. Allegient allowed my dog to travel one way with my husband but did not allow her to make the return trip with me. This is incongruous and inequitable and leaves passengers in unfortunate situations. Enforcement of Allegiant specifications would appear to be at the whim of the staff on duty, rather than being consistently applied by all staff at all Allegiant service counters. The staff at the Allegiant counter at LEX, including the Manager on duty, did not appear to have empathy for my situation, and did not care that the pet carrier was allowed on a prior Allegiant flight. They were rude, uncaring, and I was horrified. Allegiant is not consistent with enforcement of its pet carrier policies, nor do they respond to only complaints to Customer Relations.",-1
2022-05-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to St. Petersburg,,,,,,1.0,1,they just give you the run around,False,"  The worst experience I’ve had with an airline. I flew an employee down for work. He got to the gate 20 minutes before the flight was supposed to take off and saw it leave the terminal. I called Allegiant to try and get a refund. After waiting for 2 1/2 hours, I spoke to an agent for less than 10 minutes explaining the situation. She said “I shouldn’t even be talking to you this long since you cannot verify the information.” I gave her all the information. She was just embarrassed because I called her out for not accommodating or making any sense. It’s clear they make you wait on hold for an inconceivable amount of time then if you are patient enough to get a “support” representative they just give you the run around then hang up on you. It’s pathetic an airline like this even exists.",-1

I showed up to board the plane 2 minutes after the 15 minute grace period due to running through the airport with an infant on my chest, a diaper bag and a bag of clothes for myself and my child. They would not let me board the plane or speak to anyone about it and were so rude I began to get upset. I explained that this was my first time flying with my baby as I am a new mom , but also under immense depression due to the passing of a family member. Despite telling them I’m flying for my fathers funeral, seeing my infant and also had 2 TSA members run ahead of me to explain to them I was coming and held up due to testing everything in my diaper bag. They were extremely rude, wouldn’t direct me to someone to at least switch my ticket and completely shewed me away. I have flown with this airline multiple times but I will never fly with them again. I also cannot reach anyone for a refund or credit",-1

No one could tell us when we would board or land and the flight info was never updated. Employees acted like we were an inconvenience trying to find out when to tell our rides to arrive at the airport. Then my luggage was lost. Neither airport has Allegiant baggage support or customer support. Their customer service number gives a busy signal and the few times I’ve gotten through directs me to the website and hangs up. I’ve submitted 3 requests online for lost luggage, but received no response. Someone at St. Pete accidentally answered my phone call and said she’d call back in one hour, 5 hours ago. The Memphis Airport Authority told me they get calls like mine everyday, but there’s no way to hold them accountable. Oh and if enough time passes, they’re not liable. It’s almost been 24 hours of calling and emailing and I’ve spoken to one person who won’t call back. I’m leaving out so many other terrible experiences.",-1

2022-05-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1,should be ashamed of themselves!,True,"  Worse experience ever! On 5/13/2022 I drive from Louisville to Cincinnati to catch a flight to Vegas at 6:00am. I arrived to the airport right at 4 and was in what I thought was the line I needed to be in to check my bag only for them to keep calling for Denver flights and never once mentioned Las Vegas. So several of us made our own line since the Denver flight was their main priority while I’ve already been waiting to check in my bag for almost 45 min which was 5:00 am by that time. So I was next in line and looked away for literally one minute to turn around and see that an old lady had jumped in from of me. Although I was in a panic pressed for time I let it slide because I do respect my elders little did I know she was blind and needed special services which took around 20 min for them to check her bag then walk her to her seat then waits with her for someone to accompany her. So by the time I was able to check in the lady that worked with Allegiant was extremely rude and immediately told me I couldn’t check my bag as it was too late (mind you I had been in that line for over an hour at that point). So she told me I could go through TSA with my checked bag. So me being determined to go on my trip that I had planned months prior I attempted it. Once I waited in the TSA line for another 20 min waiting on the dogs to sniff everything then they had to search my suitcase bc it had all of my big bottles of toiletries that I had just bought so they could throw them all away. By this time it’s 5:50 so with tears in my eyes I asked the TSA gentleman to please hurry bc I was about to miss my flight. By time he was done it was already 6am and I had just missed my flight! So I immediately call Allegiant to express my frustration after waiting on hold for over two hours just to speak with someone I explained the situation and although they admitted to it being their fault and me being there in plenty of time because of the unorganization. They refused to give me a refund and only gave me $842 towards a future flight although my total flight was $1400. I’ve flown with Allegiant multiple times and have never had a bad experience before now. So not only did I miss out on my first time experience to Vegas I also missed out on a music festival that I had paid $500 for months prior. Because of how rude and unorganized Allegiant in Cincinnati was/is, I will never be using Allegiant again. This is wrong on so many levels and Allegiant should be ashamed of themselves!",-1
2022-05-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Concord,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,the experience is terrible,True,"  I have flown Allegiant Fort Lauderdale to Concord, NC many times. Every time I have to contact customer service, the experience is terrible. No more pandemic, but there's still a 2 hour wait time, they suggested calling off peak hours between 9pm and 3am. The chat feature indicated it was working many times, but it was not. The best option was email.  The flights have always been good but the customer service is absolutely disgusting. I can no longer support this airline and will fly to Charlotte via a different airline in the future. If you are considering flying with Allegiant, I would reconsider. Seriously. You'd think I would have saved money because of their fares. Wrong, it's actually cost me more than flying a major airline. Just don't do it. Reconsider.",-1

Checked my bag. When I arrived in Fort Walton, my bag never showed. I later found out they put my bag on a plane that went to North Carolina. Although it was tagged for Fort Walton. I immediately reported my lost bag, that's how I found out where it was. They said they would mail it to my house. A week later, it arrived with the entire width of the front ripped. I took pictures and emailed them upon it arriving. Forgot calling, you can't get through. They said to tell them how much I paid and when I bought the bag. I stated it was $95 and it was bought 2016. That was in March. Today, May 16th I just received and email for a virtual card for $38. They claim depreciation. Am I wrong but isn't a suitcase an item you either use or don't use. I don't think you trade it in for new ones like cars. And 60 dollars less than what I paid for it.",-1

I have been trying to contact anyone at Allegiant by phone and chat for the past 3 days. Their policy to change or cancel flights was updated for covid so it is only $25 but it has to be 7 days prior to the flight. We tested positive for covid 4 days before our flight. The only options were to cancel and lose our entire purchase amount or reschedule for some future trip we don't have plans for (only $20 off each ticket after fees anyways). We responsibly did not go to the airport and get on the plane where we could have infected other people, but it almost seemed like that was encouraged by Allegiant since there were no viable options to cancel without completely losing our money. Waited on hold for hours each day just to be disconnected. Terrible customer service and Covid policy, 24 hours I could understand but a lot can happen within 7 days.",-1
2022-05-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Sarasota,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,The airline stranded 7 people with no way home,True," 6 days before our spring break trip, our flight home from Sarasota on 4/9/22 was cancelled by Allegiant. Since we could not get through to Allegiant's customer service department, we sent an email requesting a 1/2 refund so that we could book another flight home. With no notification, Allegiant cancelled our entire trip, including the flight to Sarasota. When we rebooked the same flight they charged us an additional $500 for the same flight we had booked since October 2021. There was no one for us to talk to on the customer service line (waited on hold 6+ hours once), no one available to chat with on-line and no one available to help us at the airport. After 4 separate trips to the airport, we finally found an Allegiant manager who then informed us that he could offer us no help. The airline stranded 7 people with no way home during spring break week and offered no assistance. We had to find another airline (Delta) and paid $1000 more for a flight from Tampa, just to get home because Allegiant offered no other options. We have read on-line that they have offered $100 cash vouchers per passenger for their inconvenience. But when we finally got through on their customer service line today, their service representative, refused to allow us to speak with a manager and then hung up on us.",-1

The H.R. department of Allegiant Air in Cincinnati were the department that denied entry, don’t really know why they had the final say-so? One of the representatives showed the one and only place obscurely placed notice where it stated 48hrs notice. You would think it would be more prominently posted as well as mentioned by the 3 different representatives I spoke with. Super upsetting and really badly organized by this airline!

2022-05-05,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Austin,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,will never have my business again,False,"  So very disappointed with the customer service! I chose this airline because they offered direct flights from Indianapolis to Austin, TX. I bought 6 tickets for my family. Later, I received a notice that they were changing my return flight. Due to the airline arriving much later, my nephew was no longer able to go. I tried to change the passenger name on their web page but it said I call customer service. First, I called on 6 different occasions and the phone rang as ""busy"". When I finally go through to a recorded message, they told me that the wait time was 2 hours and 40 minutes. They recommended that I call back between 9 pm and 4 am. I did that and still had to wait for 2 hours. When I finally reached a live person, she told me that they could change the name if I paid $75. I first asked about the message that I heard repeatedly over the last two hours which stated that their change fee was reduced to $25 due to COVID. She told me she didn't know what I was talking about - she asked her supervisor and told me I would have to pay the $75. I expressed my concern that $75 was their normal non-COVID rate and there should be some concession for the flight change just for good customer service. She indicated that she could refund the ticket but it would require cancelling all of my tickets and rebooking it which could lead to additional ""air fares"". I couldn't trust that she would get it right and my entire trip wouldn't be cancelled so I paid the $75. Congratulations, Allegiant. You took an extra $75 from me and will never have my business again.",-1
2022-05-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst experience I've ever had,True,"  The worst experience I've ever had. It was my first time booking with the airlines and will definitely be my last. First and foremost, this this airlines has the only direct flight from OKC to Las Vegas. The day of my flight, actually 20 minutes before the flight to Vegas took off, we were all notified that our returning flight had been cancelled. The worst part about it is that they sent the voucher and information through text which seemed very sketchy. The passengers around me actually didn't believe it was from the airlines until we saw the confirmed email of cancelation. The staff didn't even tell us while we were sitting there. I had to book another returning flight with another airline which was double my original flight. What's even worse is that all flights from the moment my flight was canceled, Allegiant canceled all of their flights for the next few weeks! With that being said, all the phone prompts stated and even emails as well said that if no action was taken the amount would be refunded to the card on file. That was a lie. I waited till after my trip to see if the money was there. It said 72hrs so that was also a lie. I called the support line which was complete trash but was able to get a hold of someone who was very helpful. They finally issued my refund (I have email proof of my refund and what I'm owed) which seemed that if I hadn't have called they would have kept my money. They then said I would received my refund in 5-7 business days. Those days have now passed and the money has not been placed back into my account. I've waited on hold for 3 hours while I work for someone to pick up and they still haven't. I've been promised a refund twice and have not received it. This airlines is definitely taking money away from their customers. I will never fly with them again.",-1
2022-05-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toledo to Phoenix,,,,,,1.0,1,such awful customer care,True,"  I have never experienced such awful customer care! I had to fly to Ohio for a sudden family death. My grandfather passed away unexpectedly, after I had to have emergency surgery in April for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Needless to say, funds were short, time frames were sporadic, and emotional distress is at an all time high. We found a “really good deal” via Allegiant Air at Toledo Airport. I arrive an hour prior to my flight (yes, I’m aware “2 hours is recommended”, Toledo airport is small enough I can walk end to end in under 10 minutes.) The guy at the airport won’t let me on. Okay. I spend 3 days trying to get ahold of someone from customer service.  Finally get through, explain the situation, and the guy tells me because i arrived an hour prior, and not to “recommended” 2 hours, that it was a no show and I forfeit my funds! Absolutely not. I have arrived at this airport 30 MINS prior to departure, and never had an issue. The guy from customer service continues to tell me I simply forfeited my funds. “You can escalate higher, but it won’t matter”.  Neither my family nor friends will ever use Allegiant air.",-1

I booked my rental car through Allegiant and needed to modify it due to a flight change. Was put on hold for over 6 hours and then they disconnected me. Called the next day, the morning of our flight, was on hold for over 3 hours and had to hang up as it was time to board my plane. I emailed Allegiant over a week ago about this issue, still no response. At the airport today, with my veteran husband. According to their website we’re each allowed 2 checked bags as long as we’re on the same itinerary. Nope, lady insisted I needed a spouse ID card as well. I asked for the manager, who just stood there and did nothing. I asked for her to connect me with the Customer care center. She handed me a card with the same phone number as I called last week, 702-505-8888 for which no one will answer, ever. My only option was to pay the additional $100 to check 2 bags. So far, this trip with Allegiant has cost me an additional $200. I’m aware they change for everything, however, this never should’ve happened! Lesson learned. I will never ever fly Allegiant Air again. I would give them a second chance if I knew they had a working Customer Care center, which they clearly don’t.",-1

I fly a lot and have never had to pay extra for a carry on, and every other airline I fly on allows checked bags to be 50 pounds. The Allegiant website does not make any effort to alert the traveler to these significant differences. In flight they offered drinks, but ALL were at a cost, even water.

2022-04-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to West Palm Beach,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,delayed and delayed and delayed,True,"  Allegiant flights have terrible seating, big aisles with small uncomfortable seats. They're cheap so you use them, but then they can make an entire trip bad. They delayed and delayed and delayed for hours, until at night, last minute, they cancel with only offering a lousy refund as they only have flight certain days. This causes everyone to panic and have to buy a hotel and find a way home. Absolutely poor but we will see how customer service is with my reasonable request for them to accommodate my purchases for new flight and hotel.",-1
2022-04-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,"Savannah, GA to Indianapolis, IN",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Poor customer service!,True," I was not allowed to move up to a front row seat for more leg room (just one seat in front of mine) even though there were 2 open seats. I had bundled my flight so I could pick my seat, have a carry on and check a bag. I asked the agent to change it prior to boarding the plane, but it would cost me. After I was on the plane, I asked the flight attendant if I could move and she told me no because that seat costs $30. I told her I bundled my ticket, but she said it didn’t matter. Poor customer service! To top it off, I was not allowed TSA pre-check b/c it wasn’t listed on my boarding pass. So why bother having the pass when they can deny at any time. I asked why and they said it was Allegiant that makes the decision. I do not have a record and not a risk. Just a 55 year old woman.",-1

I would not fly again with Allegiant.",-1
2022-04-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Destin to Grand Rapids,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,they are a joke,False," Destin to Grand Rapids. I had an emergency flight to Michigan after my mother had a stroke. The flight was scheduled for take-off in the afternoon. Allegiant Air kept delaying/changing our flight time. Finally, at 9:30pm (when the airport was closing) they cancelled our flight claiming ""We had to time our pilot out for exceeding flight hours"". Our pilot landed from Nashville, TN in Destin, FL. All of the passengers and staff were abandoned at the airport. We were told no refund could be provided but they would get us on a flight at 7:30am the following morning. They changed our flight on us 4x - we didn't end up boarding until almost 24 hours later. They issued us vouchers for $100 ea (x2) to be used anytime between June 2021 - June 2022 for an apology. Surprise, they closed the VPS/Destin concourse for an expansion and aren't booking any flights until September 2022. There is no other Allegiant Air route within a 3-5 mile radius from me. So, not only did I lose 2 full days of seeing my ill mother, they gave us vouchers knowing we couldn't use them. A concourse expansion is a planned construction project and to shut it down for over 6 months and not let me know is wrong. I need to get back to Michigan to see my ill mother for Mother's day 2022 and now have no choice but to drive or spend $ on another airline. This used to be my favored airline, and now they are a joke.",-1

Have been reading horrible reviews about them, but decided to give them a chance.  The last flight I took was delayed for “mechanical issues” flying to my destination. And flying back was delayed because they overbooked by 2 seats.  Stupid, inconsiderate, and uncaring. This will be the last time I give Allegiant the benefit of the doubt!!",-1

I am in Florida with my mother and had a flight back to Michigan at 7. Our flight has now been delayed 5 times to 10:30 due to lack of preparation on the airlines part. We have 3 hours to drive after we land in flint and won't get home till 4 am now.

I downloaded the app on my phone the night before and checked in to my flight with in 12 hours of my flight time. I got to the airport at 6am and went and sat in the Cafe by the security clearance until it was closer to time to get to my gate. At 6:30 I went to the security line, I got the the front of the line and was advised by a very nice TSA agent that I wasn't checked in on the app and would need to go to the front desk. I got in line and waited for an Allegiant representative as I approached the counter I explained the situation with the representative who was very condescending and even grabbed my id out of my hand with force. She advised me the cut off was 5 minutes ago and that I would have to reschedule my flight and pay a new fee. I told her that I don't want to reschedule because this is a very important military event I have to be at. I just needed to check in and she yelled that there is sign on the counter and that is the rules, if I didn't like it I could call the 800 number and to get out of her line. I did move to the side and called Allegiant and spoke with a representative to whom I explained my situation and she advised me to go back to the counter and have the agent check me in since they have been having glitches with the app lately. I did so but was told that didn't put a key note in so shes not going to do anything and I could go to another airline but she don't have time to deal with this pettiness and walked to the back room even the other employees standing there kept apologizing for her rudeness.  I got home and sat on hold for over 8 hours and no one answered.",-1

Got to the airport and no one staffs the airline Check-in service desk! A line had already formed and would be standing there waiting for appropriately 4 hours! As Seniors, we went and sat down in a different area but had no airport amenities such as dining until after we check in God knows when! On the other end, our hosts will be inconvenienced until after midnight on a work day. What A disaster!",-1
2022-04-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to Mesa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,first bad review I’ve ever given,True,"  I purchased a round trip flight. My returning flight got canceled. They emailed me, so I went into their website to change it, and the website confirmed my flight had changed. I thought all was good. Proceed to day before I depart, I’ve heard nothing. So I check and I am not booked for the flight. So, I called, after 3 HOURS on hold they proceeded to tell me that because they “didn’t see the change”. All they could offer was a different flight (I had a hard return date). They didn’t offer anything other than a different flight that was DAYS later. I don’t expect much, I don’t care about a refund, but come on. I asked them if there were any fees for canceling if I booked the new flight (just in case I couldn’t get a flight with another airline), I was told no. Luckily I found another flight on the day I needed to be back. So, I proceed to cancel my flight that is days later with Allegiant and was told it was a $95 fee to cancel. I already paid for my flight, and extra for a carry on, now they want to nickel and dime me even more? Especially after they are the ones with a faulty system? I called again (only an hour on hold, this service agent was much nicer). Luckily the fees were bi-passed and a refund was issued. I’m the type of person who only writes reviews for exceptionally great and extremely terrible experiences. This experience and their service was so bad that this is the first “bad review” I’ve ever given in my life. Yes, the flights are “cheap”, but after this I’m willing to pay more to make sure I don’t have to deal with allegiant (or anyone like them) ever again!",-1

So frustrating! I have the Allegiant credit card that I had a $300.00+ fraud on my account, which the bank was able to fix and send me a replacement card. I have been online and calling for 2 weeks and have never been able to book online or book through customer service. They tell you to leave a message but the message system is always full.  I went into their website to send my concerns to corporate only to get another error message and could not “send” the message! I managed a customer service arena for 35 years and this is totally unacceptable! I must say that I love being able to fly from Maine to Florida in a little over 3 hours but only if I’m able to book a flight!! Get it together Allegiant Air before your stock crashes and you are no more!",-1

The decision was finally made about 2 hours before flight. I was advise from managed your trip to call — after several calls I was unable to cancel the flight. To my surprise, 30 mins before the flight I get call from the local agent asking if were able to arrive in time. I explained that we could not make the flight and I tried to advise Allegiant air, we would not be able to fly today. The agent, advise me that she would call back within 30 mins to help me rebook my next flight. In 30 mins, I get the call, agent was able to assist me with a credit for my next flight. The Knoxville Agent went out her way to help us. n 30 years of flying, this was best service I could ever ask for. Thank You Allegiant Air, the Knoxville Agent.",-1
2022-04-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Arkansas to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they do not have any customer service,False,"  So we’ve flown Allegiant multiple times over the years and almost every time we have either a delay, rude attendants, or the current situation we are in now a cancelled flight. As soon as we were notified of the cancellation we attempted via Allegiant.com, the Allegiant App, via phone by several different numbers, and even attempted to chat live with an agent. The line was continuously busy for hours, the live agents are offline, the app and website both will say either “something went wrong” or “prices have changed” preventing you from making any changes. I even went to their Facebook page to attempt communication with someone. So what I’m trying to say is, don’t expect help resolving any issues that may arise from this company because they do not have any customer service what so ever.",-1
2022-04-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Mesa, AZ to Provo, UT",1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,I will never fly Allegiant again,True,"  You get what you pay for with Allegiant. The airline is extremely cheap and offers the worst customer support as a result. Both of our flights to and from our destination were canceled. Both times the airline offered a small voucher and when I decided to cancel and use a different airline on the return flight, they did not refund me my full money for the tickets. Customer support is absent, you will never get a hold of them. The company uses horrible integrity and treats customers terribly. I will never fly Allegiant again and suggest anyone else do the same.",-1

2022-04-07,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Harrisburg to Sanford,2.0,,4.0,,,5.0,3,staff were very pleasant,False," I was apprehensive (a gross understatement) to fly on Allegiant. I needed to go to Titusville for 2 nights and thought I would try Allegiant because it leaves from Harrisburg (very close to my house) and arrives in Sanford (easy airport). I fly a lot and am fortunate to have experienced some excellent airlines in coach, business and first class. I was NOT looking forward to flying Allegiant and was reading to have delayed flights, dirty planes and rude staff. My flights were ON TIME, the ground and in flight staff were very pleasant and the planes were as clean (or dirty) as my previous flights on other airlines. My flight to Sanford was on an A319 while the return was an A320. The seats on the A319 are VERY VERY CLOSE with little leg room and are very much like lawn chairs! The return flight seats had a normal amount of leg room. Seat do not recline. My only complaint would be with the Sanford airport and not the airline. Because the airport is small it is very easy to navigate and car rental and returns are a breeze. While waiting for my flight I ordered a drink. Well alcohol is $15 a drink! I am fairly use to 'airport pricing' and thought this was a bit high. Last month in Baltimore I ordered the same and it was a 'mere' $10 for the same. Maybe the price to pay for the small and easy airport convenience.",1
2022-04-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Pittsburgh to Sanford Orlando, FL",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the worst budget airline customer service I have ever encountered,True," I would not use Allegiant Air again if they paid me to do so! I have been attempting to simply upgrade my car bundle to a larger car for weeks and weeks and weeks. The car rental service (Enterprise) cannot assist me, because they say it was booked thru Allegiant. I have called and called and called and called and have been placed on hold for periods that exceed 2 hours. No one ever answers, and the call just hangs up on you after you have been holding for extended periods of time. In fact, often the customer service line simply rings busy. I have tried their online chat and there are never representatives available. I have sent multiple emails and never get a response. It is not worth the tiny savings you think you are getting. They indicate that you can make changes and even cancel for free but trust me, you will never reach anyone to help you to do so. Avoid them. This is the worst budget airline customer service I have ever encountered.",-1
2022-04-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sarasota to Peoria,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,3,Terrible customer service,False,"  Terrible customer service regarding cancelling flights, baggage etc. I tried calling Allegiant for over two weeks daily and never got through to them to discuss a cancellation I wanted to make - it cost me $100 Baggage. I flew from point A to point B and then with the same carry on I was pulled out of the boarding line and told it was too big by 1/4 inch and charged an additional $50 on top what of had already paid for a carry on. At least be consistent if you’re going to gouge customers.",-1
2022-04-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,St Petersburg to Provo,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,an example of poorly run operations,False,"  Allegiant cancelled the flight due to rain and they refused to do anything about my return trip. So there I was thousands of miles from home, stuck to find another airline at the other airport to try find some way home. They never offered any type of remedy.  No amount of cost savings is worth the stress and anxiety of trying to find a flight on Easter week. I was such a fan of Allegiant until this disaster. What an example of poorly run operations.",-1
2022-04-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Belleville,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,seen their last dime from my family,True,"  We have friends who frequently use them and they have recently told us that they have had delays and even last minute cancellations. We booked a quick weekend getaway to Las Vegas. The flight out from Belleville was delayed almost an hour, not in love with this but, hey, we’re going to Vegas so let’s just be happy and enjoy. That’s what we did and it all worked out. After spending a few days there we were enjoying our last afternoon and preparing for dinner and a show and I hear my wife say “OH NO!” We found out around 6:00p.m. That our flight for the next morning had just been cancelled. Saturday evening plans had to be put on hold. We tried finding alternate flights and Allegiant had none to offer. Other airlines were filling up faster than we could book seats. We had a 3 way call with our in-laws as well as our daughter and we were all trying to get seats on a flight so we could get home today (Sunday) to pick our pet up and prepare for the workweek. Finally our daughter text us at 10:00 Saturday night telling us Southwest had just opened a flight that would depart at 5:30a.m. this morning 04/03/2022. We were fortunate enough to be able to jump online and get 2 seats booked so we could get home. Those tickets cost us and additional $1,400. Allegiant messaged us telling us how sorry they were and that they would give us a $150 voucher to be used on a future flight They wanted us to know they were here for us and appreciate us. We aren’t interested in a voucher! We are interested in our money back and the difference we had to pay because of the inept business practices of Allegiant Air. We don’t know if we are even getting a refund on our tickets because when we try to call they are experiencing higher than normal call volume and our wait time is approximately 2 hours. They suggested we call between the hours of 9:00p.m. and 4:00a.m. Pacific time.  Allegiant left us and a lot of other customers high and dry. If possible they have seen their last dime from my family. Not sure how long a business model like this one can last but I’d say things don’t look good for them!",-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Boise,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,cancelled our flight while we were checking in,False,  They cancelled our flight while we were checking in and they didn’t notify us in any way. We stood there trying to find something else and they were no help. The only available flight for us was Thursday. We will never use them again. We ended up having to drive 12 hours home.,-1
2022-04-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Fort Lauderdale via Tequesta,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,3,Bad business practices!,True,  Bad business practices! It seems they are cancelling flights based on the amount of passengers not on the amount of employees. Canceling last minute and saying you can schedule another flight at no extra charge but making none available. When you go back to their website you can book but not at original price. They have done this several times.,-1
2022-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,cancelled 2 hours before departure,False,  Our flight was completely cancelled 2 hours before departure. Due to a little rain shower in Tampa. Completely ridiculous. They couldn’t even just delay the flight a couple hours. Completely cancelled it. Even during spring break. When many families including mine have had trips planned for months. Never flying Allegiant Air again.,-1
2022-04-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fargo,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,get much less than you pay for,False,"  Avoid this airline. You get much less than you pay for. Initial price sounds great but when they ruin your vacation you will wish you flew on a real airline. Customer service is horrible. They just don't care. On my most recent trip they ruined my golf club case (tore the handle off and didn't even tuck it inside so I could fix it - it was just gone). They took two weeks to review my claim and then denied it (of course) because their policy is that you have to file it within 4 hours of the flight arrival. Their was not one at the airport to file a claim with. So after waiting for my damaged bag to arrive, then getting home, the 4 hour window was expired. If you sucker for the cheap price Allegiant offers, you will be disappointed on what a miserable experience it turns out to be.",-1

So after waiting several hours at the airport since 5:30pm we were not able to leave. Next flight was not available until Monday night, so we lost several days of our already booked vacation and paid for hotel rooms. Mondays flight was then delayed and we didn't get into Florida until after midnight and by the time we got the the hotel we had essentially lost another day.",-1
2022-03-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,I've had it with them,False,"  The return flight of purchased round trip flight was cancelled by Allegiant Air unexpectedly a few days prior to the trip. Email and customer service number direct you to manage your travel online. Tried multiple times to change our return flight to no avail. Kept getting error code despite trying to change flight to other available flights on work computer, home laptop, and via app on cell phone. Called customer service number and says 2 hour wait time. 6 hours and 20 minutes later no answer just same message over and over stating someone will be with me shortly. Called my wife's phone also and that phone has been on hold for 3 hours with no answer either. Really only chose to fly Allegiant as it is only direct flight from Asheville to South Florida which is ""easier"" with kid but after multiple flight delays and cancelled flights I've had it with them. Rather pay more to take connecting flight with Delta or drive to larger airport for direct flight.",-1
2022-03-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to New Orleans,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Never again will I fly Allegiant,True,"  Get to the airport at 4:15 eastern time. Flight was to leave out at 6:30. Allegiant has 2 gates at Indianapolis. B3 was schedule to depart to New Orleans and B4 to Las Vegas. I see several flight attendants and pilots coming and going from each gate. They then switched gates, and then delayed the New Orleans flight by an hour saying due to weather. Both planes were in the gates so I knew it was a lie. Weather is clear across the board for that flight. Las Vegas flight boards and departs, and then New Orleans is canceled. Next available flight was 4 days later! Every other airline flying to New Orleans was over $600. Allegiant offered nothing, just a $30 refund for the $103 flight i purchased! I’m from Louisiana and was up to plan my wedding. Finally found a $211 flight out of St. Louis to Dallas, and Dallas to New Orleans. Took a $100 Uber to Terre Haute where my mother picked me up! Never again will I fly Allegiant. If you can’t sell enough seats and blame it on weather what’s the point of even keeping the flight scheduled until after it was supposed to depart!",-1

They delay the flight and tell us due to a technical error and then say because stewardess didn’t show up on time and then the stewardess shows up and says they messed up on her schedule and just called her in. Lie. Then I had 3.5 hours on hold to talk to customer service and no answer. Then the flight was 4 hours delayed and the returning flight took off 10 minutes EARLY so I missed the flight. I call and they tell me they are sorry and.,-1
2022-03-26,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,"Denver, Colorado to Asheville, North Carolina",1.0,,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1,I will never fly this airline again,True, Where do I begin? It may sound dramatic but being stuck at the gate on a plane for over an hour while the airline figures out how there are two extra people on the plane! First the seats and space is tiny. I’m average height and my knees are almost touching the seat back in front of me. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable and there is zero elbow room. The seats do not recline so my what would have been landing at 12pm now will be after 1am. I will never fly this airline again.,-1

I’m currently here for my new flight and they have now delayed it 3 times. Horrible airline. I will never fly with them again. 22 cancelations in the last MONTH ridiculous.

2022-03-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Jacksonville,,,,,,1.0,1,customer service was so abhorrent,True,"  There was an accident on the freeway that caused a 2 hour delay. Didn't make my flight in time. I reached out to Allegiant and their customer service is absolutely the worst most unorganized circus I've ever encountered. Truly it's laughable. After being given 6 different numbers to call and trying to navigate their app site that wasn't working at the time; I gave up. I didn't fly with them because of the 2 hour traffic jam delay so I can't review the flight, but the customer service was so horrible that I feel I should warn people. Everyone gave me a different number to call. I will never book a flight with Allegiant again because they obviously do not train their staff to care about customers. It felt more like dealing with a fast food employee that doesn't care because they hate their job. Allegiant, the Greyhound bus of the skies. Never again. I've learned to pay more for good service.  I never got on the plane. Their customer service was so abhorrent I'll never try Allegiant.",-1
2022-03-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to McAllen,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,There is really no one you can talk to,True," I had booked my brothers a flight from Nashville to McAllen on 2/25/22 for travel dates 3/24-3/27/22. While I was booking the flight the website kept glitching and trying to refresh. I finally got their tickets booked. So yesterday on 3/23/22 I pull up their itinerary to check them in and print their boarding passes, I get an error message saying it is not within the 24 hour time frame to check in. So, I immediately look at the departure date and time and realized that the departure date was incorrect. I then checked the return date and it was the same exact day 3/27/22. So the flight ""I supposedly booked"" was supposed to depart at 8.52am to land in McAllen at 10.55am then to get off that plane and board the next plane since it departs at 11.38am and come right back home. I tried to modify the flight to correct it. They were wanting to charge me $652 to change the date. I looked up the correct flight and realized that there were not many passengers on that flight. I called the (702) 505-8888 and waited for 5 hours and 25 minutes with no response. My phone died. I ended driving to the airport and of course there was not anyone at the desk. I sat down and tried the ""chat with a live agent"" option before leaving the airport. The website told me it would be a 25 minute wait. I waited for those 25 minutes and more and I got a ""Null Response"" whatever that meant and the screen never changed. So at this point the only chance I had to modify the itinerary was to go to the airport the morning of. We show up this morning, I immediately politely ask to speak to a manager. They said it was only a supervisor present. I explained the situation and told her I would mind to pay the difference of the tickets of what they cost today. The whole trip came out to be $338 for 4 passengers. The ""supervisor"" stated that she could not make any changes on her computer, that she would have to call CS. She then reiterated everything I told her. She said to make the changes they are going to charge you $780 and that's waiving the $75 modification fee. I told her I was not going to pay the $780. I was willing to pay half of $780. Why could not they catch the error, I booked the dates correctly. Had their system had not glitched we probably would not have this problem. The flight was empty! Less than 30 had booked that flight. I asked to speak to the guy on customer service, but they said I could not talk to him. I would have to call that 702 area code number. They came back and said the best they could do was for me to pay $554 after tax Which I ended up paying. There is really no one you can talk to. No one answers that customer service number they provide. The chat service is a hoax. I've read on multiple sights that they do not respond to emails. First and last time!",-1

I've had to use them twice when the route and time I needed was only met by Allegiant. Nobody died, but otherwise ugh. Cranky staff, lost luggage, weird staffing (they close the counter to work the gate) means no service. Mind you that fits the lousy website, insane hold times, etc.. You name a service and I promise its at the bottom of the barrel.",-1
2022-03-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Flint,,,,,,1.0,1,the flights never took off,True,"  I booked a round trip flight through Allegiant because they are flying the new route from Boston to Flint. On not one, but both the legs of my trip, my flights were canceled. I could say I won’t be flying with Allegiant again but, I did not even get to fly with Allegiant since the flights never took off. So, I guess it is better to say that I will not be booking with Allegiant again and I will definitely be warning friends and family not to as well. It was awful to have my flights canceled at such late notice. I needed to arrive in Michigan for a wedding in which I was a bridesmaid in. My returning flight was canceled less than an hour before take off when I was already at the airport. I had to rebook last minute flights on a different airline and of course the prices were astronomical. I had to pay $665 to pay out of pocket for my new, last minute flights when Allegiant messed up my plans and did not even provide any reasons for either cancellation.",-1

Our returning flight was delayed at first and then completely canceled. We were already inside the plane when we were informed. I tried chatting with customer service, they said they couldn't so much and disconnected the chat. I've tried calling but was placed on hold for almost 4 hours and I gave up. I've called back multiple times but Allegiants line sounds busy and disconnects. I've emailed them with no response. The people at the ticket counter could only help with certain questions. We were rebooted for Monday March 21, 2022. We were supposed to leave Friday March 18th 2022 originally. They are not making themselves responsible for hotel or transportation, or anything else due to the canceled flight. It was my first time flying with them and it will be the last. Horrible way to treat customers. Some people didn't find a returning flight till a week later. It is terrible. We are losing time from our jobs, missed appointments, etc. We understand issues happen. But they should be considerate and cover hotel and transportation costs at the very least.",-1

They seated my child next to strangers, breaking their own policy in doing so. When I was told to call to complain, I was on hold for over 7 hours (see screen shot) before the call finally dropped.

We sat more than 7 hours in the airport. Delay after delay. At 2.30 am finally cancelled flight. Tried giving some voucher that we couldn't use. No hotels and not one person gave a damn. While they all left to go sleep somewhere they said we could sleep on this hard floor. No place to eat if you fly evening. Was the worst experience. They get a 0/10 rating from us.,-1

Please rewrite your policy on veteran’s dependents bags since you’re not going to honor it. The line was very long and they only had 1 attendant. When we finally make it to check in, my DD-214 wasnt enough for them to check my wife’s and kids bags along with mine. Their policy clearly reads that as long as we are flying on the same itinerary, dependent bags are free as well. Ask for assistance with my elderly mother in law. Was told someone would come get her, they never did. Luckily a TSA agent seen us struggling and offer to help. He even told us how terrible Allegiant’s service is!

I would much rather pay more money for more organization.",-1
2022-03-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Knoxville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Save yourself the headache and money,True," This company is despicable. We purchased a flight and rental car. My husband was flying out of Vegas and due to misinformation by security guards he wound up missing his flight. We tried calling the customer care number and I was told that my hold time would be 2 hours. I guess they meant 2 times 3 because I spent 6 hours on hold trying to pay the $75 rescheduling fee. We wound up getting him a flight on another airline to Nashville for today. We spoke with Alamo and they said the rental was good for 24 hours so if he made it to Knoxville he could still use that portion of the trip. He drove from Nashville and was told to speak with someone at the airline. The ticket agent finally got someone on the phone from customer care and he said the car was forfeited by missing the flight and although he can pay $75 to reschedule the flight he can’t reschedule the care. Are you serious? It was purchased as a package but can now be divided to keep money. The car was more than the ticket and that’s what we cared about at this point. Now he has to rent another car for a week. Not to mention the day he wants to fly back (3/24) home they don’t have service, so now he’s out of $977.00, a new rental car fee and possibly 3 nights of unplanned hotel stays because they can’t get him on a flight until 3/27. These people suck as a company and it’s insane that they actually are still in business. We’ll definitely never use this airline again. Save yourself the headache and money.",-1
2022-03-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Asheville,,,,,,,1,They didn’t even care,True,"  They canceled the flight with an option only to reschedule two days later.

First flight was delayed twice so we arrived two hours late at our destination. Return fight delayed 3 times then canceled. Our options were to reschedule flight or get a refund. The next flight was not for 3 days so we opted for a refund. That was a joke as they offered 1/4 of the original price. The new airline does not fly into our original airport where our car was so we had to figure that out as well. What a way to treat you customers Allegiant.,-1

Contact center rang busy for 2 days forcing us to schedule another carrier. Website showed only one available seat and we needed two so could not re-book online. Finally got on hold on third day, over two hours on hold. They got us on the plane but offered no reimbursement or even flight credit. Just $22 in vouchers for 2 days of hotels, food, and $200 in cancel fees on the alternate carrier- cost us well over $1000 total. To not have anyone available at the contact center or the website accurate/ functional for two plus days is beyond unacceptable. A shameful disgrace of a company.",-1

2022-03-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sanford to Albany,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The flight attendants were nothing but rude,True," By far the worst airline, honestly they should be shut down. Flight got delayed from 3pm to 4pm then after getting to the airport they over booked the flight by 1 person so they were delayed for another 30 minutes so they could kick someone off. Finally we board and sit there for over an hour and a half because they were having “mechanical issues” which they have every flight. We then get told to deboard the plane and switch planes. After we had to sit for another hour and was scheduled to get to Albany at 10 pm when we were originally supposed to get home at 5.45. The flight was so uncomfortable and the pilot clearly had no clue how to take off a runway. The flight attendants were nothing but rude probably because they work for the worst airline. Last time I flew through them in August they made us sit on the plane for 3 hours for again “mechanical issues”. Maybe if you have this many mechanical issues you should just not be an airline.",-1
2022-03-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Appleton to Hilton Head,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,"not an airline, it is a circus",False,"  This is not an airline, it is a circus. They drop a bunch of flights at one time leaving you stranded. Was in the airport 2 hours early going on vacation and a text comes across that they flat out canceled the trip. Not a lot of choices at this point to get out of Appleton to meet my family. Just stranded. Phone number is busy and website barely works when they drop them. Low and behold my brother reluctantly booked with them and they did the same for his Spring Break trip.  A joke and travel at your own risk plus be prepared to maybe be stranded a couple days or have the funds to get booked on a much higher fee. I was in the airline industry for 8 years and this one plus its cousins are a crap shoot at best.",-1
2022-03-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Key West to Nashville,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,still no word from Allegiant,True," Key West to Nashville. Trust me. Book with any other “airline”. Was notified via the Allegiant app our flight home was cancelled a couple hours from departure. Tried every phone number I could find for Allegiant for hours. You either get a busy signal or put on hold for hours with no answer. Commuted to the airport to find all Allegiant staff had left already and would not return. Other customers and airport staff suggested to rent a vehicle and drive to Miami or Ft. Lauderdale to find a flight home. 48hrs and 2500$+ later still no word from Allegiant. Still unable to reach them via phone, chat or email. Praise the AA agent for finding us a flight the next night when no flights were showing for the next two days with anyone. We will never fly with Allegiant again. You shouldn’t either.",-1

I was supposed to fly back tonight 3/14/22. I received a message that flight was cancelled. They don't have anymore flights to my destination until 4 days from now. Tickets in other airlines will cost me between 500-700 one way to return home. Allegiant gave me the option at no cost to fly back with them 4 days from now. I chose that option, had to pay for a seat. I tried cancelling flight and I can not speak to anyone. Ticket cost about $300 and t hey were only going to refund 48 minus the seat option.

I was already using a voucher for a big spring break trip with my son. The vouchers are set to expire in June. Had to rebook last minute on another airline for twice what the entire trip with hotel and Vegas concert tickets cost previously. At this point, Allegiant cancelled more flights with me than completed. I wish they’d just reimburse me the value of the voucher and I’d walk away. Heck, pay a discount value for the voucher. I just want to be done with them, but the voucher value is significant.",-1
2022-03-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Huntington,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,There is no way I'd fly with this airline again,True," Not a good experience! The flight out was just fine. However, the flight home got canceled the day of just hours before I was supposed to start heading to the airport, tried to book an alternate flight on app, it froze, went to airline desk for assistance, attendant told us flight was full, stepped to the side and booked seats on website on my phone since app was not working, went back to the same attendant and told her we booked our flight and needed our boarding passes. Then we had to fly into the middle of nowhere (Huntington WV) just to get close to home, get a taxi, stay overnight in a hotel, and book a rental car that wouldn't be available until the next morning to get the rest of the way home, ALL of which I had to pay for myself. Pretty pathetic my phone was more useful in booking a flight than the desk computer at the airport. Spent more time and money trying to get home because of this experience than it would have cost to just book a different commercial flight through another, more reliable airline. I also had to find a coworker to cover my shift I will now be missing in my efforts to just go home, as well as emergently asking our pet sitter to stay another night. There is no way I'd fly with this airline again unless I truly had no choice, and there is no way I'd recommend this airline to anyone unless they love unexpected ""adventures "" and have unlimited funds to dig their way out of it. Can't wait to see my credit card statement after all this nonsense!",-1
2022-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Greensboro,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,"livid, appalled and extremely upset",True,"  Worst Airline of all airlines for sure, no wonder they're so cheap it’s like buying a great value brand product with this airline. Don’t expect them to be punctual, my flight has been canceled twice to go home in the last two days. So I left Greensboro to go to Florida and visit my family for spring break I flew Allegiant like I usually do had no problems flying here on my way back home to fly got to the airport which was 2 hours away only to find out an hour later my flight got canceled. I guess the weather was perfectly fine in Greensboro and Florida but maybe there was weather issues in route towards Greensboro - they never gave me a reason to as to why it got canceled. The people at the desks weren’t very helpful in this situation and couldn’t afford another flight back so I booked another flight home on Sunday with them. I waited to Sunday, drove to the airport and 2 hours into my drive there I get a notification my flight has been canceled again - at this point I just want my money back as I’m not flying with them again. I’m not taking a chance that they’ll cancel my flight again so I try to get a refund on the app, it says error, I have to call customer service. I call customer service and every time I try to call the call disconnects. I can’t get a hold of anyone I’ve missed out on work and school over this. I just wish I could get a reason as to why they keep canceling flights. I just want a justifiable reason and they can’t even give that to me. Come to find out my buddy is also flying Allegiant on the same day a couple hours later to Virginia out of Florida, Virginia is very close to where I was supposed to be flying to and are flights are scheduled only a couple hours apart - his flight doesn’t get delayed or cancelled his flying the same route almost and almost around the same time but his doesn’t get canceled. I’m livid, appalled and extremely upset. I can’t believe or understand as to why this has happened to me twice. .",-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boise to Orange County,,,,,,,1,appalled at your customer service,False,"  I am appalled at your customer service! I sent you several emails telling you of my having to cancel my trip with Allegiant because the flight schedule did not work with the sudden challenges I was dealing with in the rapidly deteriorating health condition of my Mother. I received emails back telling me what to do, calling CS if I was within 72 hours of my scheduled departure. I complied with what was asked and was repeatedly told that my wait time was at least 2 hours. However, if I was to call back between 9pm and 4am I would be able to talk to a customer service agent. On the 8th of March, I did just that, calling at 12:15am and waited on hold until 2:30am, well past 2 hours, hanging up, never having talked to a CS agent. Allegiant misrepresented CS options to me. I did look at the FAQs and found that Allegiant does not offer a bereavement refund for a scheduled flight. In addition, Allegiant wanted proof that I was making that claim. Is Allegiant that insensitive? Basically, Allegiant’s inept & insensitive customer service policies cost me $166! I do have a choice in what Airlines I use for travel. I will NEVER choose to use Allegiant again! Allegiant can try to be the most low-cost airline available, but if Allegiant treats other customers like Allegiant treated me, Allegiant will not have any customers to fly.",-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sarasota  to Flint,,,,,,,1,worst travel experience I have ever had,False,"  Safe to say Allegiant Air is the worst travel experience I have ever had. They are made up of the most incompetent staff I have witnessed and are as helpful as a pile of bricks.  They canceled my original flight at midnight and told all passengers that they would not be helping us rebook or reschedule, and that we would have to go on the app and do it all by ourselves. I had to scramble to pay $830 for a new flight 2 days later. I also called their customer service over 60 times in one day about getting a refund (also sent two emails) and have yet to hear back. My new flight has now been pushed back five hours and there isn’t a staff member in sight to answer any questions or help anyone. These people should all be fired immediately!",-1

Is it really worth the small savings? Cancelled our flight last minute without providing a back up or a reason. Left our party of four without transportation to our vacation. Prepaid for our condo, car rental, 24 rounds of golf (4 people times 6 rounds) and the cut-rate airline. Not sure how this will turn out. Flew Allegiant two weeks prior to Punta Gorda. The return flight was utter chaos trying to check in with hundreds of other passengers at the same time. Lines went throughout the airport and ended by the baggage claim. Apparently, they booked several flights to take off around the same time (Rookie Mistake and Poor Management). My wife has had it with this outfit and will not do business with them again and will cancel their credit card. What an extremely poor run operation with no attention to the customer. Do yourself a favor and use any other airline.",-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Niagara Falls to Clearwater,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly them again,True,"  Worst experience ever. I was scheduled for a 11am departure and received a text alert at 8am the flight was delayed to a 2pm departure. We had already crossed the border into Buffalo so stayed in the general area burning time at a nearby store shopping and were going to head to airport for noon; 2 hours before the revised flight departure. At 10:55am, I received another text that the flight had been moved up to depart at 12pm, literally 1h5m from the time the text was sent. We rushed to the airport and were in the line to check in bags within 10 min of this time. At exactly 1115pm the single person working behind the counter announced they would not check in any more bags even though myself and at least 40 other people were still in the line. From the time they sent the text with the new departure time to when she announced the cutoff, it was not physically possible to check in all the people there. Things just got insane from there with everyone screaming, people taking full luggage through security. The one person working just screamed at everyone they should have been there earlier despite all the revised departure notifications. The manager was apparently hiding upstairs and would not come down to help. I have never seen before where they delay a flight by 3 hours and then bump it back up by 2 hours with 20 minutes notice! The flight ended up leaving an hour late with half the passengers, everyone very angry and many stranded. This was completely avoidable situation if it had been managed properly and passengers were given more than 20 minues notice of the earlier times. I will never fly them again",-1

Cancelled all flights on their airlines from Nashville to all over. Seemed for no reason. Weather was fine. Then we waited an hour after cancellation for the bags to get off the plane. They lost my husbands suitcase. How can they lose it, when we never had lift off? They did! We have to eat $5,500 of our hotel cost.

I never expect a lot from Allegiant Air because they are one of the cheaper airlines but come on Allegiant. After receiving news Saturday morning that my grandpa passed away that morning, my siblings and I immediately look for flights to be with our family in jersey. We chose Frontier to get there from Florida. That flight was perfect, no issues. The reason we decided to take Allegiant for our flight back was because my older brother was already there and we wanted to fly back together. We originally got our flight back for Tuesday. After being with our family for Sunday and Monday we realized the funeral was going to be on Wednesday and we needed to be there for that. We call Allegiant and after waiting 1 hour to speak to a representative we were told they could get us flights for $230. So our flight home in total for all of us ended up being $800. Which was $600 more than what we paid for our flights to begin with. My sister asks if there is anything else they can do due to it being a death in our immediate family and funeral arrangements being made, we were told In this terrible time we should have chosen the flight protection and that she was doing this as a courtesy. Charging us $230 more than our original ticket. We will never choose Allegiant Air again.",-1

I received a refund for my ticket but no refund for the 35$ processing fee they charged me. Similar things have happened in the past according my friends who have also flown this airline. The website did not give me the option to book another flight (the option was greyed out) and when I called customer support it went to voicemail (at 3.00pm on a Thursday). I ended up having to book a flight with Spirit Airlines for the next day. I think Allegiant should cover the cost difference.",-1

I booked a weekend flight home for some much needed quality time with my loved ones and to see my dying grandfather before he passes. They canceled the flight while I was standing in line to check my bags at 930 PM. I called to get another flight home after being refunded the next week but there is nothing they can do since it was after 72 hours. The flights for the next few months are much more expensive then the flight I was scheduled to go on. I called and just wanted to pay my original fair for the amount I was suppose to fly out that day. I don't think thats too unreasonable. Now I have to buy another set of tickets that cost much more than the original and take more days off of work. This is costing me more than I would have spent not to mention a much greater hassle. Thanks Allegiant for the horrible experience and money grabbing.,-1
2022-03-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Greenville,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,pay the money to book a real airline,True,"  I shouldn’t have expected much on a flight with Allegiant Air. Low expectations but even lower delivery. Try boarding half the flight before realizing one of your flight crew missed their flight to the airport. Or leaving 2 hours late because nobody in your company communicated with each other. Honestly- just pay the money to book a real airline. The anxiety of wondering if you will even make it home from your trip, and realizing you are more stressed than when you left on your 3 day vacation isn’t worth it. Don’t book Allegiant.",-1

Flight was originally planned to leave at 2.11, was delayed until 2.45. The plane didn’t get to the gate until 2, from there we waited an hour to board the plane. After boarding the plane we waited two hours because they were conducting maintenance on the plane. After two hours of sitting on the flight, we were told to get off the flight and we were delayed again for another two hours.",-1

We couldn’t book another flight because they kept saying our flight will go out tonight. We waited until 0100 and was told then it was canceled. We couldn’t book another flight until next day. Lost out on $1600 fishing trip and a $200 night at hotel in which none was refundable. The airline manager at the gate told us she could get us a hotel so promised 350 dollars for this event. After waiting and waiting only received $175 dollars. I took a video of the Manager stating all of this and they still will not honor what they said they would.  I will never fly with them again unless I see come customer services in which is honorable.,-1

Completely unacceptable.,-1
2022-03-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Petersburg to Key west,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1,canceled the morning of travel,False,  Bought round trip ticket from PIE to Key West and back. The trip to Key West was fine. However the flight back was canceled the morning of travel without explanation. Although we received a refund for the canceled leg but doesn't help much when you have to scramble to get another flight/ airline in that day. Same thing happened two weeks later for friends visiting from Kansas to St. Petersburg Florida. Return to canceled by carrier without explanation. Terrible airline,-1

The second item was the fact that my husband's TSA Precheck was not on his boarding pass although mine was. I called several times and after being on hold for hours I was never able to get through. On top of that, a friend I was traveling with had a critical issue (she could not check into the hotel which was reserved through Alliant) and she was on hold for 5 hours and never got through. This is completely and utterly ridiculous!",-1

Tried canceling online, the site was down. Tried again the next day, when I clicked the cancel flight, was prompted to call. Upon calling the number several times over the next 4 days...got recording ""Due to high call volumes, we are not taking any calls right now."" Found another number on google for Allegiant, just kept going to a busy signal. Tried to use the online chat agent, said no agent available at this time. (Tried several different times). Last option for contact was to use the email link, I have sent 2 emails and received no response. Can't even say it was poor customer service, because I never received any replies!",-1
2022-02-28,0.6,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Cincinnati to Fort Lauderdale,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,4,The attendants watched and stood watching without any help!,False,"  Until the end of the flight I was going to give a 10 out of out of 5 stars, I would give 5 stars because the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly helping people in the front row place their carry-on over head because the front row was not able to use the 1st 2 storage areas because the crew uses them and they made sure the 3 set of storage was for the first row. The were kind and friendly throughout the flight. Until the end of the flight! Once we landed I asked the 2 flight attendants directly sitting facing us ""are we going to be able to get out carry on items before everyone behind us rushes up to the front to get off the plane?"" The attendants stated ""sometimes it works but it’s a free for all. Let the free for all begin!"" It was very uncomfortable because people behind us were rude and stood in the aisle and didn’t care that we needed to get our carry-on items out before we could leave since the flight attendants didn’t want to work any longer or help any longer my husband assisted the 2 elderly men sitting in the front row on the other side to get their carry inside while the people behind us made it difficult! The attendants watched and stood watching without any help! Very inappropriate! Allegiant could of had a great review and the attendants destroyed it at the end!",1
2022-02-27,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Allentown PA to Sanford FL,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,No regard for the customer whatsoever,False,  I agree with all the negative reviews for Allegiant Air. Looks like the flights are cheap until you add all the “extras”. Everything is extra including seat selection. My biggest complaint however is their Customer Service. Tried to find out why my rescheduled flight cost me $300+ each for person by calling Customer Service. We called 3 times and each time waited over 3 hours for someone to answer phone. Each time we finally hung up. Who ever heard of a 3+ hour wait to speak to a person. What a joke. No regard for the customer whatsoever. Flying with this airline is not worth the aggravation. You may pay slightly more going with a more reputable airline but it would be worth the extra money.,-1

Our flight was delayed 15+ hours with the gate agents always telling us it would leave in 45min. Eventually the flight was cancelled and the gate agents very clearly stated what we would receive for compensation of which I took a video of for proof. We had to fly out on an American flight the next day at our own expense and still have not received the compensation which they promised. Customer service says there is nothing they can do (spent countless hours on hold). This airline is full of crooks, liars and thieves.",-1
2022-02-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fargo to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,will never fly Allegiant again,False,"  Horrible airline. Avoid at all costs. Prices look cheap but they are listed with no carryon, no checked bag, no seat assignment. After adding everything up a regular airline is about the same. Seats are hard plastic and don't move. Customer service is horrible. Was on hold for 30 minutes after they reassigned our seats to ones I didn't want. They would not change to an aisle seat like I had before they reassigned me because it cost $1 more. I offered to pay $1 but customer service rep said no - she was horrible - will never fly Allegiant again.",-1

It’s worth the extra $100 to know that your flight won’t be cancelled with our accommodation and to know that when you get on the flight it’s going to leave less than an hour late. This company has lost all reliability.,-1

I will never book with this airline again. I tried every method to get hold of this airline. Live chat (wasn’t working), email (never received a response), phone call (waited on hold for 5 hours and finally gave up). Their policy states you get a refund if you rebook due to weather advisory but I have yet to receive one. And the up charges on your flight are insane. But the customer service is what it the most appalling. There is NO way to get a response. Maybe if I’d stayed on hold for another 5 hours? At the very least they could offer the call back service other airlines provide so you don't waste hours listening the same recording over and over every 10 seconds. Do yourself a favor and never book with this awful airline— you end up paying more in the end and they don’t give a damn about their customers.",-1

Cancelled our flight with no apology, and we had to find a 15 passenger van to take our grandchildren to Disneyland. Kids were in their carseats for 12 hours.  I tried calling to make sure they would at least keep the return flights and our children and grandchildren would flight back and we would drive the van alone back to Salt Lake, but after a two-hour hold, they did not answer the phone. They should be forced to close their business. They are careless about their clients, rude, and they do not respect anyone. They break every possible rule.",-1
2022-02-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Flint to Punta Gorda,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Not worth the hassle dealing with them,False,"  Our flight from Flint to Punta Gorda was unable to land in Punta Gorda. Plane was changed to land in Stanford Orlando. Children without adults traveling to grandparents were not given help 250 miles from Punta Gorda original destination where grandparents were waiting to pick them up. Senior need assistance were left with no help. We had to drive 259 mile each way to get our family. Then they would not give us our luggage, and told us we had to pick it up at Punta Gorda the next day but wouldn't give a time. Tried calling Allegiant to see when it came in. Might just a well call the moon. Not worth the hassle dealing with them.",-1
2022-02-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St. Petersburg/Clearwater to Huntington,4.0,,2.0,,,3.0,2,taking advantage of budget travelers,True,  My parents were supposed to fly out of St. Petersburg Airport at 6:45 PM. They began getting 4 delays and finally were set to fly out at 9:45 PM. AT 6:00 they cancelled the flight with no other flights leaving until Monday (3 days later). My parents would have to spend another 450.00 in lodging to stay until Monday and their dog sitter could not stay any more days. My dad had to pay another 150.00 that he doesn't have to stay the night and I had to spend 800 to pay the difference to get them flights out of Tampa. I was on hold with Allegiant for 4 hours and they never picked up the phone. There was no weather and no reason given for delay. They are predatory and make a business out of taking advantage of budget travelers.,-1
2022-02-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Petersburg to Greenville,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,A very poor customer service,True,"  I have flown with Allegiant Air many times in the past, but this was my last time I will fly them. The last four times I have flown with Allegiant Air the flight either got canceled or delayed by more than five hours. This last trip was the last straw. I had 2 major issues this last time and I will highlight them below. 1. I am legally blind so I require extra help getting where I need to go. For the most part a family member or friend that takes me to the airport gets me to my gate and at least gets me in line to point me in the right direction. I was sitting in the gate area with my grandmother and was basically denied service. My grandmother walked up to the Gate counter and asked the gate agent when we started boarding if someone would just walk me to my seat. The man at the desk said and I quote “you need to stay with him. We are short staffed right now and since he’s not in a wheelchair he is considered lower priority“. So  just because I’m not in a wheelchair means that my disability isn’t credible enough for you to care. Eventually a gracious passenger who was sitting next to me in the gate area offered to help me. Speaks a lot of volumes when the people getting paid to do this stuff can’t even do their jobs.  The flight was delayed by four hours which I understand does happen and it’s out of the control of allegiance staff. Where I take issue is when we get literally zero updates about what is going on. My 84-year-old grandfather picking me up in Greenville had to sit there for over two hours because he had no idea when I was getting in and I could only give him updates when I received them. A very poor customer service. In conclusion this is one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown. If you can avoid it please do so and save yourself the trouble.",-1
2022-02-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Greenville to Miami,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,Horrible customer service,False,"  Horrible customer service. My return flight was cancelled less than an hour before take off. Waited in a massive line at the ticket counter only to be told there was nothing they could do. So many people were upset, the police were called to the counter. I was not offered a voucher to fly another airline, I had to find a hotel for the night and fly out the next day on a different airline which I had to pay out of pocket, plus I had to miss a day of work because of the delay. What's worse is that I never received a refund for the flight! Customer service is rude and uncaring about the havoc they cause. Never again will I be suckered into another trip with them.",-1
2022-02-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sarasota to St.Louis,,,,,,1.0,2,never going to fly with them again,True,"  They canceled my flight the day of while I’m at the airport. I called customer service and they promised me the world saying I can reschedule my flight, I’ll get a cash voucher for another flight, I’ll get a cash reward for all the hotel in trouble I had. I didn’t get a single thing the customer service has you on hold for 2 to 3 hours they tell you that there’s nothing that they can do it’s a different department anytime you need help whatever they promise you is a lie they don’t give you anything they promise they just want you off the phone worst customer service ever I have never taken my flight. That was four months ago. I haven’t gotten a refund on the ticket that I did purchase even though they canceled it I didn’t get the cash reward that they offered because I had to cancel my hotel and rental car. I also didn’t get an extra airline voucher for a ticket. Whatever you do don’t fly with them you will get nothing in return. And it’s sad because I had their credit card and it’s the only airline that I’ve flown for the last two years 30 or 40 trips and now I’m canceling the credit card and never going to fly with them again over one flight.",-1

2022-01-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,cancelled within a couple hours of takeoff,True,"  Horrible what they did to us. The airline cancelled within a couple hours of takeoff. We had to fly with other airlines the following day for triple our previous paid flight. We had to get a room for my wife and our two daughters, food, car rental, fuel, we all lost a day of work, and the airline ticket counter said it was because the airlines was short staffed due to COVID. They said they would refund us, and we would have that refund within 72 hours. 5 days later no refund and another $2,495.00 in cost for the trip. When I finally called them for our refund, they said it was due to weather. No benefits because it was an act of ""God."" However, if you cancel a flight in less than 24 hours there is a $75.00 per person/ticket fee. They don't pay that same fee to you as a customer, you're just screwed. NO alternate flights. No nothing.  If they were kind enough to do anything for us at all we wouldn't be this upset. I hate writing a review on some business. This hurts to no end.",-1

Canceled all departing flights for the rest of the day and had one girl working the help desk. Poor girl had to cover 2 canceled flights by herself and couldn't even get ahold of Allegiant customer support herself. Waited in line for 2 hours to write my name on a piece of paper to get a full refund. Had to call allegiant a week later to actually start the refund process. Told me I would receive the refund in 7-10 days. Well it has been a month now and I have not received my refund. I have sent emails, tried their online messaging, as well as wait on hold for 2+ hours. I am out a lot of money due to that one trip because I had to hurry and book a one way flight home with another airline the day after the 26th. The flight crew was great and super helpful but as for their customer service line it is crap. A month later no refund and I have tried calling everyday for the past 2 weeks but it is constantly a 2+ hour wait to speak with someone. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap flight means cheap customer service.",-1

Two of us purchased tickets to fly out Monday evening non-stop to Las Vegas for an 8 am class on Tuesday, at the world of concrete convention. We got an email two hours before departure that said our flight was cancelled. I called the phone number on the email and asked why it was canceled, the guy said it was because they didn’t have a crew available. We ended up having to drive 7 hours to Denver and catch a 6.30 flight. We were exhausted and also late to the class. Allegiant doesn’t have what it takes to be an airline. I won’t waste my time looking at there ticket prices in the future and sure hope nobody else does either.",-1
2022-01-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1,money you save is not worth the headache,False," This review is for my adult daughter, who I bought a ticket for her and her boyfriend to travel from Spokane, WA. to Las Vegas, NV on Jan. 13, 2022. 45 minutes prior to departing, the flight got cancelled due to ""weather"". My daughter asked the gate agent why other airlines were taking off and if the agent would re-book her with another airlines. The gate agent told her that the weather caused the flight to be cancelled and it was not her job to re-book her onto another airlines. I was on the phone with my daughter when all this took place, even though she's an adult (20), she doesn't have much experience dealing with this and I was trying to help her. I was appalled by the customer service this gate agent was giving to my daughter and hearing her deal with other customers in the area. She lacked professionalism, courtesy, intelligence and patience. My daughter then took a picture of the weather 30 minutes prior to departure and the weather was clear and the sun was shining and, still, other planes were taking off. The money you save is not worth the headache in dealing with this airlines. You have been warned.",-1

Prior to the flight leaving; they advised quite a few passengers that there was a change in seating. I paid for a window seat in the back of the plane. However, they changed it to an Exit row in the middle of the plane. I advised the flight attendant of the situation and that I paid for a window seat. She said the plane was absolutely full and no arrangements could be changed. She said that I should be happy that I have extra leg room. In any case, when I sat down, the gentlemen that they put me next to was very rude. He was a larger man and wasn’t budging on room. It made it very uncomfortable for room. It was just disappointing that this airline cares more about the profits than they do the customers.",-1

I was stranded in Florida for over 14 hours. I was suppose to fly out and be home by 10:30. I had to fly to another airport where my vehicle was not at, so I had to find a ride there and pay extra parking fees on top of what I had already paid. I had to pay 100$ in Uber fees so I could eat and not have to starve due to not being allowed to check a bag, find someone to keep my child while I was stuck in Florida, pay extra for my hotel to allow me to stay longer. This was the worst experience I have had flying.",-1

They refused to book me with another airline for my return and said they could give no compensation other than a flight voucher. I had to scramble last minute to find another flight.

If you don't mind missing your trip, this may be the airline for you.

It was not due to weather. No return flight was offered until jan 5. We had no hotel after jan2, no rental car, my husband & 1 would have lost wages starting from jan 3. We had to get a 1way rental car and leave Orlando on new years eve and start driving the 18.5 hours back to Michigan at an additional fee of almost $1000. Not to mention the additional fee of gas used, a hotel for 1 night. We also couldn't use our remaining theme park tickets, left our previously rented condo 2 nights early, and had bought food we had to throw away. Allegiant only reimbursed us for our cancelled flight. Nothing else. They stranded us 1200 miles from home and said only ""sorry for the inconvenience"". It was terrible. I will never fly with them again.",-1

They are literally incompetent and do not care at all about their passengers. I had a flight scheduled from Vegas to Spokane that was canceled less than forty eight hours in advance. I did understand this, since many flights are being canceled due to COVID. However, this airline has been unbelievably unhelpful since my flight was canceled. I originally waited on the phone for more than an hour and a half to get in contact with a customer service representative to see if there was any way they could help me rebook my flight or provide compensation, as every flight is obviously significantly more expensive now than when I booked my flight on Allegiant several months ago. As this airline barely goes anywhere and has no relationship with any other airlines, they provided no way for me to get to my destination and did not seem to care at all that I'm now stuck without a way back to school. The airline did provide a small voucher for having to cancel the flight last minute but the voucher did not work, saying that my intended method of receiving the voucher was not working. I am counting on this voucher to help purchase another flight but am unable to get in contact with anyone from this garbage airline. The call wait time is scheduled for more than three hours, I received an automated response to my email saying that it would take upwards of a week to respond and that I needed to call instead. The online chat is unavailable. I thought I knew what I was getting myself into by booking Allegiant, but it's worse than I could have ever imagined. I don't care how big of a savings it is, nothing is worth the headache of this airline.",-1
2022-01-08,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Las Vega,3.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,Horrible way to treat customers,False,"  Allegiant is the worst airline out there, and that's saying a lot because airlines these days are pretty horrible. They offer a very competitive flight rate and no frills. My husband booked a flight to Las Vegas, they changed his flight there from night to morning, so he had to miss a day of work and then they just cancelled his flight home, no reschedule. They refunded the ticket and then gave a $150 check to get another flight home on another airline. This would have been fine, but all the other airlines were way over this amount. Because it was cancelled 2 days before the flight, the prices for flights to get back home were mostly over $500! I called Allegiant to ask how $150 was supposed to get him home and their answer was that it was nice of them to give the $150 and basically we have to pay the rest out of pocket. So either we pay the remaining amount, or my husband lives in Las Vegas now. We will never fly Allegiant again, and will discourage anyone from ever flying with them, even though they were so kind to give us a voucher for another flight with them in the future. Horrible way to treat customers. Don't risk getting stuck and hung out to dry by this company.",-1
2022-01-05,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to St. Pete,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,This is bad bad service,False, We left Cincinnati Airport going to st. Pete Florida 12/30/21 until 1/2/22. We had a party of four. When we landed in St. Pete we were told the belt broke and our luggage never arrived. They was around 20 25 other people on our flight that didn't get there luggage. The lady gave us a slip on the slip it said get what items we need and keep our receipts they would reimburse us. All we had was the clothes on our back. We only went down to Tampa for a new years eve event. It was a upscale event we purchased tickets for. So the next day Cincinnati Airport called me and Laura said someone at cvg dropped the ball and FedEx didn't pick our stuff up. She said it's a flight leaving the next morning it will be on there. I asked her to called me the next day to confirm it was on there she did call however she had bad new said the flight got canceled. She said she could FedEx it but now she said we wouldn't get it til Monday and we leave Sunday night. I said that will not work. She said we can get our luggage when we come back that night ... she said she was looking at 100 bags and she felt bad for us. I told her we have nothing but what we had on out back she said go get what you need keep your receipts and we will get our money back. I feel like they should pay for our rooms flights bags the ubers we used to go get things we needed that were in our bags in Cincinnati our clothes we had to buy and the new year eve event we missed. Allegiant emailed me today saying they would reimburse us for the luggage we never got and give a 25 credit for our next flight. I told them no this is unacceptable. This is bad bad service. I also left my number on email and asked for someone to call me. I never received that call.,-1
2022-01-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Midway Chicago to Knoxville,,,,,,1.0,2,wouldn't let my daughter fly because she's a minor,True,"  I wanted to warn anyone considering having a minor fly alone with Allegiant. Allegiant wouldn't let my daughter fly because she's a minor (3 months from 18) because of the weather (I assume, which I don't know what was so bad about it), so she was stranded at Midway with no flights for her to take. That seems much more dangerous than just letting her sit in a seat (that she paid for) and flying. We had to get her an Uber to O'hare and book her another flight. She had to wait at the O'hare airport for 5 hours before finally flying home. This all started at 3:30am and didn't end until about 8pm. The craziest thing is the crew wouldn't help her at all, just no can't fly with us...good luck.",-1

While on the beach, late Tuesday afternoon we received notice our return flight was canceled and would not be rescheduled. We had to cut our beach time short so we could try and make arrangements to return. The website would kick us out each time we tried to schedule for the next flight date and phone wait time was est at 3hrs. No rental cars were available, leaving us stranded without enough medicine and a dog sitter leaving. 24hrs later we were able to make other arrangements other than allegiant. Very unprofessional!",-1

Absolutely terrible airline, if you can fly anything else do so.",-1

First they say there's too much weight and 3 people need to switch planes or 15 bags need FedEx. Then I find out it is a mechanical issue and still waiting to see if the flight is canceled. Its been over 3 hours and still waiting. They won't tell us anything. Do not fly with Allegiant.,-1

Get back to the airport only to sit on a plane for 1.5 hours and receive silly excuses. First the plane needs to be deicing, that should have been taken care of, now there's too many Christmas gifts so gas has to be burned. Then this flight is taking 5 hours. Allegiant Air is horrible and there needs to be some type of compensation for this nightmare of a day.

We received vouchers immediately along with additional $100 voucher for each ticket. To avoid losing $3500 in resort costs we had to rebook and were fortunately able to book to Fort Lauderdale later in the day. We then had to secure a rental car for an additional $1000, drive 4ish hours to Key West, extend our vacation by one day, drive 4 hours back to Fort Lauderdale and book a room in Fort Lauderdale for our final night. Original cancellation was blamed fog- older planes and landing issues. We checked on the day we were originally to return home and our flight from Key West to Asheville was cancelled as well. There was no weather issues in Asheville. Allegiant- don’t cancel your flights because they aren’t fully booked.",-1

When I arrived at the airport on Monday for my flight they told me I was not on the manifest for some reason. I had my confirmation number, the email they sent me, and I checked my bank account and showed them that I had obviously paid $209 in July for my flight. The plane was about to leave but they told me the ONLY way I could get on the flights if I was on the manifest (list of people on the plane). They told me I had to buy another plane ticket to get on the flight which was ridiculous! They told me the next opportunity I would have to get on an allegiant flight would be 4 days later! My brother was with me- he got a ticket the same time I did and he had no problems. They had me pay for another plane ticket and gave me a card for a number I should call to work out these issues and get reimbursed. I have been on the phone on hold for 3 hours straight with no one picking up these fast few days! I am completely stuck. They stole $200 from me and I wish I could reach someone to help me.",-1
2021-12-21,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Austin, TX to Punta Gorda, FL",3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,"I would avoid this airline, if possible",False,"  My flight was cancelled minutes prior to its scheduled takeoff, only after waiting at the gate for 90+ minutes. Since it was a late flight, it was rescheduled to the following day. This worked out for some passengers, but certainly not all. There was no notice of flight cancellation in advance, so everyone was scrambling to find accommodation that night and alternative travel options. Thankfully, Allegiant did put us up at a nearby hotel, however, their lack of advance notice was entirely unprofessional. Furthermore, they have made it nearly impossible to get a refund for the canceled flight. I would avoid this airline, if possible.",-1
2021-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"South Bend, IN to Sanford, FL",1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Thanks for making my vacation stressful!,False,"  Allegiant is by far the worst airline with the worst customer service I have encountered. My husband and I were traveling with young children, and paid for specific seat selection. Upon checking into our flights, our seats were changed without our asking. I tried to email customer service and two weeks later, still no response. Tried to chat with an agent, but no one answered. Tried to call and the wait time was greater than 2 hours. At the counter, they offered us row 31 (we paid for seats in row 2). The same thing happened again on the way back. I was given a customer service number to call - again to wait on hold more than 2 hours. They damaged our stroller and then told us that they accept no responsibility because of their “limited liability policy”. They sent a very snide “apology” saying that we probably don’t agree, but this is our final decision. What terrible customer service. We did have our stroller in a protective bag, but was I shocked by this? No, because they clearly disrespect your items then don’t want to take any responsibility. I’m so upset I gave this airline any of my money. I will never fly Allegiant again. Thanks for making my vacation stressful!",-1
2021-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Pittsburgh,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I am beyond disgusted,True,"  I am beyond disgusted with the quality & efficiency of this airline. I booked a flight from Nashville to Pittsburgh for 2pm. That flight was delayed & later canceled. Allegiant then booked me on another flight from Nashville to Allentown (opposite way of Pittsburgh) for 7pm. That flight was also delayed & later canceled. Allegiant provided me with an $8 food voucher that no concessions in the airport accepted from me. I am dissatisfied as I don’t think Allegiant takes their passengers into consideration as I had to pay various food & travel expenses & miss work in order to get home. They were also nearly impossible to contact & when I was reached, they were absurd.",-1
2021-12-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Eugene,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no one was there to check me in,True,"  I arrived an hour and 30 minutes before my flight and no one was there to check me in. The baggage workers told me the Allegiant airline check in agents left to the gate already for boarding passengers. I was unable to check in. While there is the option to check in online, I needed my bag to be weighed and sent through and no one was there to do that so I couldn’t go on the flight. There was no one for me to speak to. I called customer service they didn’t say sorry they said it was my fault for not being there two hours before. There was the confirmation email sent out recommending two hours before but no where did they say it was required or I would not make the flight. This airline is nonrefundable and non creditable so I couldn’t even get a different flight. Basically if you show up an hour and 30 minutes early instead of 2 hours early they won’t let you on the flight, won’t reschedule and won’t refund you. Without ever telling you it is mandatory or required to arrive two hours early just recommended.",-1
2021-12-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Indianapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,several mask violations,False," I flew from Indianapolis to Jacksonville on Thursday, December 16th, 2021. Throughout the flight there were several mask violations. A woman let her two children keep their masks only over their chins, one of which was coughing consistently through the flight. There was also a passenger directly in the row behind us who removed his mask and coughed for most of the flight. This passenger was sitting beside a flight attendant, who made no attempts to enforce the rule. Even though they announced over the intercom it was a violation of federal law, no personnel on the plane did anything. Very disappointed. We have been trying to cancel our return flight trip all day but the customer service phone line says the wait time exceeds two hours. Ridiculous.",-1

The flights are clean with friendly staff.",1
2021-12-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Petersburg to Ashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Never flying this airline again,True,"  Our flight from St Pete Fl to Ashville NC was delayed several hours due to a ""bird strike"". It was to leave at 9:55pm originally. Then delayed to 11:55pm, then 12:15am, then 12:57am.Then once we finally took off, we were told there was too much fog in Ashville. We flew in circles using reserve fuel according to the pilot waiting for it to clear. When it did not clear we were then told we would be diverted to Knoxville TN and options would be given there. Once we landed all accommodations were taken off the table. No transportation or hotel stay at 4 am. We were to originally land in Ashville, around 11pm Dec 17th. And that was the plan when all the passengers purchased the tickets. Now we have nothing and are told to figure out how we are to get to our destinations on our own at our own expense. This is at no fault of ours but entirely on the airline. The bird strike delay and then a weather issue. They claim that since it's a ""weather cancelation"" nothing can be done to accommodate the passengers. The weather is ""unforeseen circumstances"". The weather issue should have been known ahead of time. Allegiant knowingly refused to cancel the flight until it took off to be able to refuse refunds. Now almost 200 passengers including children are stranded in the wrong state and have to figure out what to do next. That is unacceptable. Refunds should be given or the airline should pay to get the passengers to their agreed destination. Or at least somewhere to sleep as their delays got us here at 4am. This is crazy. Never flying this airline again",-1

2021-12-10,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to John Wayne,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1, I will never fly with them again,True,  Absolutely atrocious. They cancelled our return flight with two hours notice due to “weather.” They gave us a refund but had no other flights until Sunday and refused to offer any form of Compensation for their decision. They said since it was due to weather they don’t have to compensate. Shocking since every other airline was still flying out of California to Utah that day. Just not Allegiant. Seems very convenient for them to cancel a flight and say “not our problem.” I will never fly with them again. The rates are no longer that competitive and after having this experience I would rather go with a big airline who actually cares.,-1

The airport was closed due to late hour. Flight was declared “cancelled.” Airline deplaned us at a closed airport, thus, no rental cars, hotel shuttles, airport staff available. Very limited (and premium priced at 2am) Ubers/Lyft available. Many senior citizens on our full flight, with no transportation options available until the airport opened the next morning. Airline offered a small compensation, which didn’t even cover uber cost back to original destination. No refund given for cancelled flight.

We were delayed for like 45 minutes because 1 person was missing on the flight. They had to do attendance 3 times & still kept missing 1 single person. It was very frustrating. There were 2 ladies that went up and down the isle to check for the people that were supposed to be on the flight. Instead of having to scan out boarding pass, they only typed in our boarding number. So I already knew something was up. We took off & it was fine for a little bit. And it’s ridiculous how the water is $3. Seriously? I fell asleep & woke up to the lights still on & it was dark outside. People were being very disruptive and just standing up, not in their seats. I was very confused. We got to our destination & we had to wait like 30 mins to get off the plane. It’s like they had to take attendance again. Never again will I fly with Allegiant Air.",-1

I called the next day and customer service said I had my one time courtesy and could call back later as no mangers on duty. Call wait time is up to 2 hrs.

When we were about to board they cancelled the flight last minute. They were unable to find us any flights until the next day which resulted me missing a day of work and pay. They got us a hotel for the night but told us we had to pay for our own transportation and that they would reimburse us. We finally get home and sent our receipts to be reimbursed and were told that it was a misunderstanding that they will not be reimbursing us for our costs of having to pay to get to a hotel or for any of our food costs. All they gave us was an $8 airport food voucher 20 minutes before our rescheduled flight was to board.,-1

I forgot about the voucher and booked a flight for February 2022. When booking this flight, my on-line credentials had no mention of this travel credit. Immediately after booking and filing flight info into my Outlook Allegiant folder, I saw the credit voucher. After numerous emails (phone hold time 1+ hours) with no reply, I couriered a FedEx package showing my voucher along with explanation of flight booked.

I checked them in online 2 days prior and they had their boarding passes ready to go. The bar codes on the boarding passes were not working so they wouldn’t let them on the flight. They also asked several people at the airport for help as to what to do and could not get anyone to help them. I was on hold for 1 hr 37 minute trying to get through to Allegiant trying to get a refund or get them on the next flight. They offered to fly them to Phoenix, Az 4 days later but I would have to pay again and refused to give me my money back. I’m outraged and will never use them again and am out $554.00.

2021-11-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to West Palm Beach,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,absolutely terrible in every way,True," Allegiant is absolutely terrible in every way. They don't open check-in desk until 2 hours before so if you have to check a bag you are waiting forever and cannot enjoy the lounge. The flights are always delayed seemingly for no reason. Why are we always sitting on the plane for 1 hour before taking off? What is wrong with this airline? The seats are incredibly tiny which is to be expected from budget carrier but stop making us sit on the flight for longer than needed. On a positive note, I have only witnessed positive staff members and they are very good at enforcing the mask mandate which unfortunately some of the lower end customers of Allegiant don't want to follow.",-1

2021-11-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chattanooga to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not be using Allegiant air for future flights,True,"  My husband and I were supposed to fly out of Chattanooga to Orlando on Sunday night October 31, 2021. That flight was canceled until the next day at 2:30 PM in which that caused us to miss a full day at the Disney part we had already paid for. However we did proceed with our flight schedule to enjoy the rest of the days in Orlando. Our returning flight was to leave out at 7:42 PM on Thursday evening November 4, 2021. When we arrived at the airport two hours early we receive the news our flight has been delayed until 10:00 PM. At a later time we receive news the delay has been pushed back to midnight. Our flight was eventually canceled in which they did not offer a returning flight the next day. We had to get home to our sons state playoff game but they only offer the next flight home which was the following Sunday. We were told our other option will be a full refund! Therefore we opted for that choice. However after booking another flight the next day home having to rent a vehicle and spending a total of $660 we get home to find out we are only reimbursed for half of what we were told we would be reimbursed for. Upon speaking with staff they would not follow through with what we had been told we would receive and did not five any further compensations at all. This was their mistake and was the ONLY reason we opted for the refund! Now not only are we out of pocket for the Disney park we didn’t make it to in time, we are also out of pocket for most of the $660.00 we had to pay for a returning flight the next day along with a car rental! This is poor business but I found out very quickly they do not care! And they obviously do not follow through with the information they give to their customers! I will not be using Allegiant air for future flights.",-1
2021-11-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Austin,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,told me that I had missed my flight,True,"  I’ve never had an issue before with allegiant but today, we encountered a particularly sadistic receptionist. We checked our bag and I had my boarding pass screen shot and ID ready. The screen shot was of too poor quality to scan (my bad). I asked if she could print my pass and she refused saying download the allegiant app. I asked again and she rolled her eyes and said no, download the app. I download the app and am locked out of my boarding pass (I think bc I viewed them on kiwi first?). The tsa printing machines are all not working so I run back down to the counter. I was served by the same receptionist who told me that I had missed my flight and was too late (it was 10 min before the doors closed). She said she too was locked out of the boarding pass too and couldn’t print them. When I explained the situation, she raised her voice at me, stating that I took up her line. Realizing she’s ready to full on yell at me, I request to just reschedule the flight if I am too late. She says she has one three days from now. At this point, I’m desperate because I’m a veterinarian and have a day full of appointments to see tomorrow. She suddenly says actually just try and prints my boarding pass! She lied about not having access then also held them hostage from me when she could have printed them for me 10 minutes ago, knowing I was missing my flight. She never offered to call ahead to check on where the flight was and guess what? It was still boarding and we made it.",-1
2021-11-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Wayne to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst airline experience by far,False,"  This airline decided to cancel our tickets to Las Vegas and they did not offer an explanation as to why. When I tried to contact them via phone, I had to sit on hold for hours. When trying to chat with them, they never had an available agent. This airline is a joke. They will never get my business, no matter how cheap they are, and you all should do the same. Worst airline experience by far and I do a lot of flying.",-1
2021-10-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Des Moines to Las Vegas,,,,,,1.0,1,don’t want to fly Allegiant ever again,True,  The worst airline. Today our flight was canceled within minutes of boarding. They had 8 seats available and we didn’t get either of the 8 seats and I booked 2 months in advance. All they could offer us was a 150.00 voucher. I don’t want to fly Allegiant ever again so that voucher is not going to suit me at all. Book at your own risk. This company is horrible and now I’m out of more money.,-1
2021-10-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fayetteville to Miami,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst customer service,False,"  I had the worst experience ever with Allegiant Airlines. They canceled my flight 2 hours before departure and when I asked for compensation for a non-refundable hotel that I booked, they did not take any responsibility. I chatted to an agent named online and he cut the chat. I called the customer service and they cut my phone after they asked for my information. Worst customer service. They don't value you.",-1
2021-10-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Asheville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Avoid this company at all costs,True,"  Friday flight starts with a 6+ hour delay. No reason for the delay, no monetary compensation for the delay and a $50 credit for future flight was offered. Sunday flight home, starts with a 1 hour delay, then turns into a 2 hour delay and then at 9PM they decide to cancel the flight with no explanation. I call to get on another flight and they offer Monday night as an option. I tell them I need to leave in the morning for work and they tell us sorry. I ask to speak with a supervisor and they put me on hold for almost 50 minutes. By the time the supervisor gets on the phone, they tell me that Monday night flight is sold out as well and the next flight is Wednesday night. They offered us $250 each for the ""inconvenience"". When I explained that it cost us thousands to drive in a car to South Carolina (hours away), for new flights booked the day of, for a hotel and for meals, they told me sorry and that they are not even required to give us anything. What kind of customer service is this? Worst airline experience I've had in my life and I work in the industry. Avoid this company at all costs. They are clueless when it comes to being guest centric. I have emailed them multiple times since my experience and no replies have been given in over a month now. What a joke of an airline.",-1
2021-10-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,4,No customer service available,False,  Never again. We flew with no issues Indy to Orlando/Sanford. Our flight on the way back was delayed by 45 minutes (turned out over an hour). Then once we landed it took over an hour for them to get us our checked luggage. No customer service available to call or in the airport at all. Emailed them immediately with my complaint and have not heard back.,-1

2021-10-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Junction to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,4.0,2,never fly with Allegiant again,True,  Would never fly with Allegiant again. Paid an insane amount extra for carry on which I then discovered I wouldn’t have needed to do. Then my return flight was canceled only an hour before and I received no help in getting a new flight to my destination. Allegiant didn’t have any other flights for four days. Have to pay on board even for water. Terrible experience.,-1

I went to drop off my bag at the counter and showed them my ticket. The girl said she couldn't find my DOT service animal form. I showed her in my phone the email that Allegiant had requested with the pdf form attached. She said she wasn't sure if she could accept that as evidence. I opened the pdf for her to see. She said that would not work now because they would have needed that form 48 hours earlier. I said, you really aren't going to tell me that I can't fly today? Yes sir, that's right. I told her and the weekend manager that I wasn't leaving unless I got on that plane. She called a security guard and the manager said ""We've cancelled your reservation and returned your money sir. I've never had an airline work so hard to not accept a fare before. I'm 66yo, disabled, and after Uber had dropped me off after an hour I was then stranded with my dog at the airport looking for a way to go home",-1
2021-10-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to California,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,mistreats its customers,False," Grand Rapids to California. The way Allegiant mistreats its customers is unacceptable. I had a flight today scheduled for 6:30 am from Grand Rapids, Michigan to Los Angeles, California. 4 hours before the flight Allegiant cancels the flight without explanation. They send you a text and an email at 2:00 am saying ""sorry, your flight has been canceled"". It is a total lack of respect for the customer. Allegiant does not care if we have to pay one more day for a hotel, car rental, food and having to buy another flight at the last minute with how expensive the tickets are. Allegiant has to take responsibility and refund every penny we had to spend for the last minute cancellation. It is a disgrace that they mistreat their clients this way.",-1

First time having family fly from St Pete airport. Outstanding customer service. Very polite and friendly service.

2021-10-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Clearwater St. Petersburg,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,would not recommend this airline,True,  I would not recommend this airline. We had been in the air until we were supposed to be landing and then they announced there was no power At the airport so we had to divert to Sarasota. Not Tampa or St. Pete which are in the same area. I am not clear on why we couldn’t circle until they figured out the issue. Then they wouldn’t let us off the plane in Sarasota as we sat on the tarmac because we couldn’t go to a gate and we needed fuel to get back to Clearwater where we were supposed to land originally. I’m out the money I spent to book a car at the airport and now not sure if I can get one to get home.,-1
2021-10-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to Phoenix–Mesa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,more stressful than any other flight,True,"  My fiancé is a transplant patient and now waiting for another transplant. She has a designated medical service dog, not an emotionally support dog, and actual trained, doctor prescribed (UofU transplant team) service dog who detects and warns of blood sugar levels. Normal airlines allow at time of check in to allow verification of service dog. I called before the flight and waited on hold for 90mins to speak with a customer service agent who explained since it was within 48hrs of the flight I would need to bring her verification letter to the desk check in. We arrived early and was told abruptly by the gate check in that she needs prior approval and wouldn't even listen or talk to us as other people were on the flight and wouldn't discuss it, she just kept saying ""it's not my choice it's not my problem"". We waited for the line to go down and then I showed her on their own website that at the gate the gate agent can accept the paperwork. She refused. She then called customer service herself and told me on the phone that there was nothing that could he done. He said he had no record of me calling, he told me there was nothing to be done and then because I got upset and angry that if I didn't let him finish telling me how it was all my fault he would cancel our tickets with no refund. I asked what we could do then he said ""find somewhere to put your pet"". I then asked if I could just take her on as a regular pet, of course I could, for $50! But then complained that the bag she was in was not compliant (service dogs don't have to be in regular bags, she has a designated bag). After arguing again with the service gate agent she finally accepted my money but with condition it was non refundable but the air stewards could still refuse the bag. We rush to the plane where the air stewards at first refused, then when we explained she was a service dog and showed her service vest still resisted.  The stewardess than says ""oh the vest doesn't mean anything you can just buy that online"" I then showed them the written doctors note and she simply said fine and wouldn't look at us. It's a 1hr 45min flight and has been more stressful than any other flight I've been on. The staff are rude, won't accept responsibility and all they want is to nickel and dime your money. Even if it seems cheaper, never fly this airline.",-1
2021-10-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Sarasota,,,,,,1.0,2,I do not recommend this airline,False,"  I do not recommend this airline. Our family was looking forward to a trip to Florida for two years. There was also a very important event that we were planning to attend there. Our youngest (5 years old) was excited as this trip would supposedly be her first time on an airplane. Imagine our disappointment when we were told that our flight would be delayed by 45 minutes due to a problem. And then 2 hours. And finally, after waiting for two and a half hours, it was announced that our flight was canceled. There was no possible way for us to get to our destination. The man who announced this (a crew member) seemed very impatient and annoyed with the crowd. We had booked two hotels for out stay. We were forced to call those two hotels and request a refund from each. One hotel was not able to provide us with a refund but the other was able to give us a refund for one day. Logically, we would also be unable to attend the race, which the kids were also looking forward to. The kids were extremely disappointed and we drove home in low spirits. In total, we wasted around five hours waiting in the airport.",-1

Long delay for the 1st blunder causing us to miss our connection. 7 hour wait for a new connection. 2nd blunder.  Woke up early and checked status of flight only to find it was canceled. No bad weather, no explanation, just canceled. 3rd blunder. Bad weather caused inability to land at Key West. Took us to Punta Gorda and dropped us off.

Our flight was for 8:30 PM departure and they started sending us msg delaying out flight early in the AM! All day they couldn’t decide what time we were departing. They told us the flight was departing at 11PM and as soon as we got there it changed to 2:30AM, after almost 5 hrs waiting, the plane got there and they changed the departure to 3:30AM, and guess what happened? They cancelled our flight due to flight attendants not being able to work for the rest of the night. this flight had at least 50 kids ready to go to Disney, kids sleeping on the floor! No food available at the airport, no one to help! This airline needs to shut down.",-1

I would never recommend taking this airline. It’s terrible, flights get delayed, you don’t get what you are promised, it’s all in all awful airline. Even if it’s cheaper, allegiant is not worth it in the slightest. You can almost guarantee you flight is delayed or canceled and you don’t get what you paid for. The best part is that they had every opportunity to fix their mistake and they never do.",-1

Cancelled 3 flights on me, 2 in one day - what's worse, they had no alternative and I was going to a funeral. No empathy, just a sad ""sorry"". I am now sitting in an airport 2 hours from home missing the funeral and no help with my getting home. This also happened on a flight with my dear brother who was going of cancer. After going to airport, waiting through 3 delays, they cancelled the flight. Had to drive my brother back home another 2 hour drive.",-1

Nobody will answer the phones or online chat I have been on hold with customer service for 2 hours. They will not give us a reason why they cancelled the flight and only want to give us a credit for all the money spent. They didn’t even give us a notification that it was delayed / cancelled until we were getting ready to leave so all the money we spent on rental car and hotel stay just went down the drain because the check in date has passed so it’s now non refundable. they don’t make any effort to get you on a different flight they expect you to figure it out on your own and “hope for the best”.,-1

Due to a mistake by our bank, our payment for bags did not go through ,more bank issues also meant we had no cash or means of using our cards. Moments before boarding, we were at a loss-as how to resolve the issue. Miriam realized our dilemma and allowed us to board without luggage payment. Thankyou Miriam for using common sense. Satisfied returning customer.",1
2021-10-05,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Knoxville,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,This airline is great for a quick cheap flight,False,"  Not bad for the price. This airline is great for a quick cheap flight. I will admit that both my departure and arrival flight ran a little late but it wasn't terrible. You also have to pay for drinks/refreshments which i think most airlines still do provide the most basic refreshments for free. I also got my luggage checked for free because it was only ""slightly"" bigger than a carry on for my return flight. I think for the price I paid (150 RT to Tennessee from Chicago) this was well worth it. I would definitely utilize this airline again. Their app was also very user friendly and came in handy when I almost missed my departure flight.",1

I prepaid my checked bag to avoid their arbitrary additional fees. It was a pound or two over, so I had to pay 50 more dollars. Their weight limit is also 40 pounds. Literally every other US carrier I looked up is 50 pounds. I’ll never fly with them again if I can avoid it. Flight was delayed. Gates moved. Poor communication all around.",-1

Was supposed to take off at 908 pm 30 September 2021. Didn't take off until after 2 am. Arrived at Gand Rapids at almost 5 am. So now I have to wait at the airport until the rental car place opens at 8am. Also no ride to my hotel room so lost out on that. And all they offered us was a lowsy food voucher. Yep done with this airline. I guess when they mean cheap fares that means service too.,-1

The staff hate their jobs, and you if you ask for help in any way they'll be curt and rude to you the whole time while they ""help"" you. They try to infect your phone with their cheap data mining low quality app. They sell your email and advertise to you constantly. Buyer beware, this airline sucks and I will not recommend it and I won't use it again.",-1
2021-09-15,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Denver,,,,,,,1,1/3 of the total cost as unreturnable fees,False,"  Terrible airline. When purchasing all indication is you can cancel free and apply full purchase price to a future trip. However, when you actually are ready to cancel you find they charge almost 1/3 of the total cost as unreturnable fees. Trying to call gets you on hold forever and you never get through. The option to live chat is met with a message ""no agents available"". After being nickel and dimed when buying the ticket you are met with many dollars fees when you need to cancel. Stay away or at least know that if you have to cancel you are going to lose a good portion of your payment.",-1

I cannot believe I had to use them again. I swore them off after multiple frustrating trips - without ever leaving on time. Here we went again! Horrible service, expensive tickets, never on time. That has happened 3/4 times I have flown- the other time was just 2 hours on the tarmac without an explanation.",-1

2021-09-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Medford to Santa Ana,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,every time there has been a delay,True,"  Great news they said: “there’s a direct flight from Santa Ana, CA to Medford, OR (where my wife’s parents live)… your family can fly from its new home in Orange County to Medford so to see the grandparents and vice versa”. Well, as of today we are on our fourth leg of doing so and every time there has been a delay. Maintenance today, as was the case on the first leg of the first trip, while on the other two delayed legs the issues have been unexplained. Seats are rock hard, flight attendants are rude, and we all know how these “discount” airlines charge for everything you do (pick your seat, carry on a bag, etc, etc) after paying the “affordable fare.” I really don’t care about all that, and was just happy to have a direct flight, but since Allegiant’s planes seems to be delayed 100% of the time it’s probably just as well to book on a real airline and make a connection in San Francisco or Portland. Allegiant is a joke.",-1
2021-09-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando Sanford to Cincinnati,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,incredibly irritating,True," Orlando Sanford to Cincinnati. I am so tired of this. The airplane was originally supposed to take off at 11:43 and land at 1:45. The flight has been continuously being delayed over and over again, mind you it’s not due to weather, something about paper work (which you think an airline would have everything complete before the flight) We boarded the airplane at 12:44 and we have just all been sitting here crammed for almost 2 hours now waiting to take off. We have been sitting on this airplane longer than the flight was supposed to be. So what was really only supposed to be 2 hours on the uncomfortable plane, has now turned into 4 hours. All the children in the airplane are all screaming their heads off and I genuinely don’t blame them, this whole situation is incredibly irritating.",-1
2021-09-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Savannah,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,plane was absolutely filthy,True,"  The plane was absolutely filthy. We walked up to our seats and had to brush chips off of the seat to sit down. The floor was covered in food. I’ve flown allegiant, delta, southwest, and more, never have experienced such poor quality on a plane. The worker was nasty, rude, and made us pay $50 for the same carry on bag that we brought with us to Savannah with the same airline and we did not pay for a bag traveling to. I have always traveled with a purse and have never been told that was considered my one personal item and I would have to pay $50 if my purse did not fit in my bookbag. Overall, If the worker has handled this differently, we may feel differently; but because of her disgusting attitude and the filth of the flight, I will never fly Allegiant again and will never recommend them to anyone ever. In fact, spend the extra money to fly another airline that treats you with decency and cleans between flights. We are in a global pandemic and this flight WAS NOT CLEANED before we boarded. They actually boarded early and took off early and had no time to clean.",-1
2021-09-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Cloud to Destin,,,,,,,1,not care about helping a customer,False,"  I had a trip planned to fly from St Cloud MN to Destin FL to ask my girlfriend to marry. 6 days before we were to leave we receive an email that our flight was cancelled. I couldn’t believe it. How could you do that to someone then offer no consolation. They couldn’t get me another flight. They do not work with any other airline. Allegiant bullied me into making a decision whether I wanted my money back or vouchers. They stated I have 48hrs or I will receive vouchers. No other airport was flying into Destin FL so our whole trip was messed up. We had to replan the entire trip due to not flying into Destin. All of my deposits were not refunded due to the short notice. I had to spend an extra $2k to make my trip work. I had to rebook flights and hotels and rental cars. I reached out to Allegiant to look for some sort of help or reimbursement for all the money I was out. I received nothing. For a month I reached out to them and finally received the most generic email ever. Allegiant does not care about helping a customer. Honestly, I have flown so many different airlines and this one makes Spirit look like a private jet.",-1
2021-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Medford to Los Angeles,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,"understand that when you fly Allegiant, you are going to be nickel and died, but ",False,"  I will never fly with Allegiant again due to their lack of communication and disrespect. My flight to LAX was fine. Had a few surprises, but nothing to really gripe about. My flight back home, however, was a disaster. We got to the airport to check our bag and were met with over an hour wait. The check in gate opened exactly 2 hours prior to departure and only one person came out at that time. She was very slow moving and was more interested in talking to the gentlemen helping her load the bags onto the conveyer than she was to help those of us waiting. About 30 minutes later, a second woman came out to help followed shortly after by a third. We finally made it to the front of the line and I asked to speak with someone so I could address my concerns. The woman helping us promptly raised her voice with me and began talking over me telling me I should have ""checked my app."" I let her know we just wanted to be sure we had time to feed the kids we were traveling with before it was time to board and she told me that was ""too bad because the terminal is under construction and they have no food."" At this point, I just wanted to leave and get to my gate because I'm feeling very frustrated and disrespected. She finishes with our bag and when I ask for my receipt she cuts me off and says to just update the app. I understand that when you fly Allegiant, you are going to be nickel and died, but I still expected good communication and customer service. I have reached out to Allegiant 3 times in the last week and have yet to get a response. Fly with caution.",-1

I have herniated discs and it's difficult for me to stand in line. They called the final call for all flights before mine. a different agent actually called out the names of people that were missing on other flights with the same company. I saw a different agent shut the door and my friend ran to the gate to try to get us on that flight. The flight was delayed because of fog so I had to sit at the gate for over 3 hours. They charged me extra to put me on a flight that was 4 hours away from where I was actually going. It was a horrible experience. All because this agent didn't say last call for boarding. I will never fly Allegiant again and I will never recommend this company to anybody!,-1

Once we were on and seated a stewardess heard us talking about being upset. She handled her job very well and professionally and she got us calmed down. Took my information and gave me a card to explain what happened at the airport. She gave it to her supervisor and everything was taken care of. I greatly appreciate the patience she had with us and her professionalism. I can’t thank her enough. We will definitely be traveling by flight with Allegiant any time me travel!,1

2021-08-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Des Moines,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I couldn’t check my bags,True,  I was going to fly out of Phoenix gateway in Mesa Arizona to Des Moines Iowa. I went to check my bags and the agent tells me I couldn’t check my bags. I would have to have someone pick up my items and had 15 minutes to do so. I informed the agents no one would make it in time. So please take my luggage off the plane. They informed me It was then 10 minutes later said it wasn’t. They told me I have to wait till Friday for my luggage to be delivered back in Phoenix. Or i could play to do next day shipping or travel to Iowa go get it. I ended up paying for a flight to Des Moines the next morning at 10 am. When I got there the counter was closed. So I had to wait another 24 hours to get my belongings. I now had to miss two days of work and my return flight was delayed.,-1
2021-08-22,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Key West to Nashville,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,4,start demanding I check my bag,False,"  While the flight attendants were nice the employee working at the counter at the Key West airport was horrible. I simply asked for a printed boarding pass. She instead decided to be aggressive and start demanding I check my bag. I told her the bag for coming down fit but she demanded I check my bag even though I paid already for a carry on. She also scanned my ticket going onto the plane and I said thank you and she screamed at me “what did you say?” Very unprofessional.  I would suggest not having unprofessional employees like this. I attached photos of other people’s luggage that are clearly bigger than they are suppose to but they were allowed to bring a carry on. Completely unacceptable, you should never be conventional with the customer.",-1
2021-08-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Nashville,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,1,Unacceptable level of service,False,"  I am a frequent Allegiant passenger, they are the only airline that does not provide baggage check staff availability 2 hours before boarding time as the TSA recommends. My wife and I were standing for 1 hour and 45 minutes just to check bags and hoping to get a meal after clearing security on Aug 10th while flying back from a Nashville weekend. Unacceptable level of service! Frontier has my next flight!",-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Destin–Fort Walton Beach to Oklahoma City,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,couldn’t get out for 2 more days,True,"  I would give them 0 stars if that was an option! The customer service my family and I experienced was horrendous. The service attendant refused to print boarding passes for my husband and kids, sending them through TSA without boarding passes. Of course, TSA couldn’t let them through so we went back up to the ticket counter and was then told that since the plane was already boarding now, she couldn’t print tickets. So we missed our flight and couldn’t get out for 2 more days and had to pay $75 a ticket to rebook our flight that they caused us to miss. When I questioned the customer service lady and her supervisor on why they wouldn’t print boarding tickets she lied and said we never asked. The prices may be low but they will scam you every chance they can!!",-1
2021-08-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to San Diego,,,,,,,1,They really don’t seem to care,False,"  One week prior to leaving the first leg of my flight to San Diego was cancelled. Consequently I needed to book with another airlines (at my cost). The very next day my return flight was canceled, once again, with me having to pay for one of my flights home. They’d either pay for San Diego to Phoenix, or Phoenix to Bellingham… not both. In the meantime when booking with another airline, that flight was cancelled, 12 hours before my flight. It all started with Allegiant, & they say it’s all due to Covid. I talked to an agent, & my response was that due to the Delta variant, people are canceling flights. How long can an airline stay in business with this type of customer service? They really don’t seem to care. I, being one customer, had to pay more than my flight cost for additional routes. It’s quite pathetic that they treat customers this way, & I won’t be recommending flying Allegiant to anyone I speak to, inquiring about my experience.",-1
2021-08-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando Sanford to South Bend,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,I’m so upset on all the money and time wasted with this airline,False,"  I will never fly Allegiant again! First, I was given an email and text message that mine and my families flight was delayed to 1.25. So we get there an hour before “take off” and was told the Fort Wayne flight already took off. In other words it was never delayed it took off on its original time of take off. Another thing is they set me up with a different flight for the next day to fly to South Bend airport and charged me $75 a person because of changing flights. There was 11 of us in total we paid an extra $825 for their mistake! I will not fly with Allegiant ever again, I’m so upset on all the money and time wasted with this airline. I have proof of all the things I wrote here today!",-1
2021-08-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to McAllen,1.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,2,never had such a horrible experience,False,"  This was my first experience ever with Allegiant, and let me tell you, this will be my last ever unless I have no choice! My grandma unexpectedly passed away and my sister and I needed to fly down from Anchorage, AK to Harlingen, TX for my grandma's cremation. We bought our tickets through Kayak.com; we were supposed to leave from Anchorage and fly straight to LAX (Los Angeles, CA) with Alaska Airlines and then from LAX straight to McAllen, TX with Allegiant. We already had to worry about the hassle of getting off of our Alaska Airlines flight, getting our luggage, bringing it to the Allegiant counter to re-check the baggage, and then going back through security in LAX to get to our gate with Allegiant, and we had less than an hour to get it all done! By some miracle, the plane leaving LAX was delayed, but even with the delay and us running our butts off through the terminals we just made it to the gate .... only to find out 20 mins later that the flight was completely cancelled due to crew. Allegiant refused to give my sister and me any kind of assistance out if a situation they put is in. We were 100% stranded in LA; since this trip was last minute and sudden, we had used all of our money plus help friends to get down to TX in the first place. When the flight to McAllen was cancelled, the only thing Allegiant offered was a refund plus compensation OR a rebooking on the next flight to McAllen which wasn't until Saturday morning. Mind you, the cancelled flight was supposed to fly out at 8 AM Wednesday morning, and the next flight out was Saturday morning. There were no hotel vouchers offered to help with the two day wait time, which left my sister and me stranded in the airport. Allegiant didn't bother to help with finding any type of connecting flights. Even if you had elected the refund, there was a 5 - 10 business day wait on actually receiving the refund, so we couldn't exactly go back to the counters to buy another ticket to McAllen, which was THE only other solution Allegiant offered; which was even more money out of my pocket that I didn't have. When I asked them if there were ANY other options they could help with, all I was told was that I could elect to receive the refund and compensation OR wait for the next flight. Those were my only two options, with no other assistance at all out of the airport. They said those were my only two options: refund and compensation or wait for Saturday morning. With no where to wait. I've never had such a horrible experience flying. Ever. When we started trying to call around to see if there was any other airline that could get us out, the other airline's response was ""well at least they can go wait at the hotel while we figure this out"" and when we told them Allegiant hadn't even offered any type of hotel vouchers or anything, even THEY were shocked. Like I said, this was my first experience flying with Allegiant and it was horrible enough that I will avoid them at all costs and will tell everyone I know to do the same. I hope that Allegiant will look at their customer service procedures and modify them for future situations like these so that other people that may end up in a similar situation may have a better experience than I did.",-1
2021-08-09,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cincinnati,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5,Worst airline I ever flew on,True,"  Worst airline I ever flew on. I purchase a round trip ticket but had to find my own way home at my expense because the airline forgot to rebook me on a flight with my fiancé after our original flight was canceled. I was told I would be refunded and compensated. I was refunded but never compensated. It cost me more money to get home because I had to catch a Uber and had to fly out of Orlando on a totally different Airline because Allegiant refuse Place me as a priority .. my fiance had suffered a stroke and seizures and was recently released from the hospital, so she had to fly home alone unaccompanied. I tried calling the airline to resolve the issue but had to wait on the phone for three hours before talking to someone only to be told I would not be compensated - the airline gave us $100 for the cancellation to stay at a hotel but never compensated me for my expense to get to another Airport and purchasing my ticket. I repeatedly request that I be compensated but Allegiant Air refuse to consider. Allegiant Air that's not care about it's passenger it only cares about the passengers money.",-1

2021-08-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst mistake I have done,False,"  I booked ticket with Allegiant Air one way from Indianapolis to Los Angeles. That is worst mistake I have done.  Flight was over booked, captain called in sick and flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. I was charged 120$ for one way and 20$ for carryon bag. No in flight services, not even water, no charging ports.",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Grand Rapids,,,,,,,2,needed to cancel only my outbound flight,False,"  Ok, I get it. Covid, .discount airline...labor shortage etc. I get it. But no context excuses how abysmally bad Allegiant Air's customer service is. I booked a flight for my wife and I. After we booked, circumstances changed and I needed to cancel only my outbound flight. Their website has instructions on how to cancel all passengers' outbound flight and how to cancel only 1 passenger's entire flight, but again, I need 1 passenger, only only 1 leg of the trip cancelled and I cannot find out how to do that. So I tried their online chat function and got a message that no agents were available. So I tried an hour late, then a day later, then a few days later .. same response every time. I reluctantly tried calling their customer service about 15 times and every time the number was disconnected or busy. The only possible explanation, is that the company has fired every single customer service agent.",-1
2021-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"never heard anything from the airline,",False,"  4 of my children flew on this airline. Somehow, my youngest daughter's suitcase is missing. So, we let them know that it was missing and they gave us a claim number and on the piece of paper they gave us said that if her suitcase wasn't found within a certain amount of time, to call the claims department. So I called the number and all it does is ring once and then instant voicemail. That alone is frustrating! I left a voicemail stating the claim number and never heard back from them after calling numerous times. So I noticed that there was an email, and I emailed them, and they send a return (I am assuming an automatic reply) message, stating how anything over $100 of items need to have had a receipt. My daughter was gone for 7 days! There are 7 days worth of clothes, and their grandparents bought stuff for them. How do you account for something that was purchased a long time ago!? That is insane! The luggage was probably had about $500 worth of stuff in it. Granted mostly clothes, but it was money spent! I got tired of calling and never heard anything from the airline, they don't care, and honestly, this has never even happened to us. I would have expected more professionalism in this, and I understand that airlines are busy and luggage gets lost a lot. So maybe compensate for that?! Have more staff to better assist your customers! I can't believe that it has been over a month and I have not heard anything about my daughters suitcase! If people need to contact your claims department, someone should be at the phones. Pandemic or not! We are all back to real life, and you are running a business! So really everyone needs to get with the program!",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rapid city to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,recommend you avoid Allegiant,True,"  Had our flight cancelled, not postponed, but cancelled! Had to then wait over 4 days to get another flight. When asking about the reason for the cancellation, they would only say operations reasons. Called to ask what this means and waited on hold for over an hour. When I finally was answered, I asked what “operational reasons” means and they wouldn’t tell me a specific, but would say it could mean staffing issues, supply shortages etc. When I finally get a flight 4 days later, my bag weighed 1 pound over the 40 point limit (I had to buy some more clothes since my trip length more than doubled). The lady at check in tells me the extra weight is $50! I ask to quickly pull a couple things out to move into my carry on and she acts all disgusted. I then leave my bag and get through security to my gate when I get called over the intercom to return to the check in counter. When I get there the lady asks what I did with the luggage losing sticker on my suitcase. I say I did nothing and she is accusing me of removing it. She then asks if I was traveling with someone and I reply that I am (my wife). And she then accuses that she must’ve removed it! I assure her that isn’t possible because she wasn’t even with me at check in counter when I dropped off the bag. She then tells me to wait there and goes trying to check all over the airport for the sticker that must’ve fallen off. She finally returns with my bag and discovers that the sticker was stuck on the bottom all along… She then tries to tell me that it was my fault for setting my suitcase on the scale wrong? (I set it on its side and she stuck the sticker on the bottom). To fix her mistake she tells me to go to the back of the regular check in line and wait to get a new bag tag to put the sticker on the top! As we are at the gate to board I witnessed two other incidents of altercations with Allegiant employees and it was a small flight! One passenger ended up crying and saying how they will never be flying Allegiant again and how terrible the service is. A quick weekend trip ended up costing me thousands of dollars for my wife and I in missed work, hotel, clothes, food etc. To reiterate, I will and would recommend you avoid Allegiant. They trick you into booking with low fare but you end up spending way more than if you just booked with a better airline. Allegiant made very little attempt to make anything better and I am extremely disappointed.",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Wichita,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I don’t understand how this airline even functions,True," I used to fly Allegiant all the time back 7-15 years ago. They have continued to decline in service but for the price I don't expect it to be perfect. I’ve had two flights canceled by them leaving me stranded, because of Covid I have been more than understanding, however my last experience will insure I never use them again. I bought a ticket for my brother to visit me. I paid extra for all the protection and ability to change my flight especially due to covid and issues arising with that. Sure enough a Covid issue occurred and I needed to reschedule my flight. I tried going online and couldn’t change my flight, I called the customer service number and it was disconnected, I tried the chat and there was no one there. I started this process of trying to get a hold of them three weeks before the flight. I emailed their customer service three times. No response. A week before the flight with no other choice I canceled the flight instead of rescheduling it. Now I am out all of the fees and processing of the flight instead of being able to reschedule it at no cost. I received a voucher and when I tried to look into booking another flight there were no flights out of LAX for the rest of the year and none into next as well. My voucher is only good until April of 2022 which is a year from when I bought the ticket not the flight in July. After researching I discovered they are moving terminals at my airport which is why I'm guessing they have no flights, so I will have to drive to another city to use my voucher and fly out of it. My option is Vegas which means I have to fly or drive there (will cost more than the voucher is worth) they are not helping with the situation or extending my time considering I cannot fly due to their issue not mine. Today I received an email stating that they received my email to them more than a month ago and over two weeks after my flight was to take place. If you don’t have people to answer your phones or answer your chats and your email responses are taking place after the flight that the issue was about you shouldn’t be in business. I don’t understand how this airline even functions, I am out the money for my flight with no time to rebook and no assistance from the airline. I will never fly them again. You will not save money. Your problems from flying this airline will cost you more than booking with someone else. If you need a budget airline try frontier or spirit not much better but they’ll at least answer the phone when you call and try to resolve your issue. If i could give 0 stars I would.",-1

2021-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Bellingham,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Allegiant has cancelled the flight out to Bellingham,False,"  Our family of five booked our flights on Allegiant from Oakland to Bellingham to bury the ashes of my father-in-law. About two weeks before the trip, our return flight was cancelled. We scrambled around, changed our plans to find and book a flight back on Alaska. Now less than two weeks from our planned trip, Allegiant has cancelled the flight out to Bellingham. What's the use of booking a flight, if they're going to cancel it at their whim?",-1
2021-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Des Moines,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly Allegiant airlines again,False,"  I was supposed to fly out this morning from Los Angeles to Des Moines and Was at the airport an hour and a 1/2 before our flight was to leave. We stood in line to check in for 30 minutes and then when we got upstairs to TSA, Our boarding passes would not Scan. We had to go back down to stand in the line again to get our boarding passes printed out and by that time at time we had 30 minutes to make our flight and they wouldn't allow us to try and make it. They told us that we wouldn't be able to make the flights so we needed to call customer service and make other arrangements. We had almost 40 minutes to make it To the gate and the representative just told me to call customer service and figure out another flight. Of course now they won't clutter won't credit me any of the money I've bought my tickets with because supposedly it was my fault that we missed the plane. Why have us check in online if the barcodes won't be read at TSA? Why wouldn't they let us go try to make a flight? I will never fly Allegiant airlines again!",-1

Terrible customer service and random cancelations. We had a flight from LAX to Reno and they just cancel it without any reason as to why it was canceled, so when we tried to call them all their phone lines are busy or not working. This company is a disgrace and should go down under. They never even helped us refund our flight, just get a voucher, which they still haven't replied about.",-1

I was willing to drive to another city, but Allegiant cancelled those flights too. I tried to rebook online but their website is glitched. I called Allegiant and was on hold for 7 and 1/2 hours and then they hung up on me before I even got to speak. I have not received a refund from them. I had to book a flight with a different airline out of an airport 8 hours away from where I live. I am now out money and have heard nothing from Allegiant. I have emailed them multiple times and have heard nothing. By far the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I need my cancelled flight refunded to my original payment.

2021-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Belleville to Punta Gorda,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,the worst airline ever,True,"  This is the worst airline ever. Please do not let the “low costs” make you use them. Allegiant Airlines delayed my daughters’ and I’s flight multiple times in the 3 hours leading up to the flight, then finally cancelled in and rescheduled it for the next morning. The very next morning the flight got delayed two more times. My husband was supposed to be meeting us on Thursday night using Allegiant and they once again delayed his flight multiple times. 5 minutes after his flight was supposed to leave they announced that it was cancelled and they would not be rescheduling or refunding the trip. They are blaming weather but what it amounted to was that there was a crew change in another city which put them behind schedule and ended up pushing my husbands flight time during a storm. You try and call customer service and it’s a 2+ hour wait to speak to anyone. AWFUL airline. Do not waste your time or money on them.",-1

Instead of having me wait on the phone for over an hour in order to cancel! Prior to calling, I was calling approximately 20 times. The phone line is always busy. There's no human who can take your call. I prepared my two confirmation numbers and the woman on the phone told me she needed the itinerary #s instead and told me to call back. Eventually, she was able to look up my itinerary using my phone number. She didn't ask for my phone number as an option instead wanting to hang up on me after I had wasted 2 hours of my precious time.",-1

After a half hour of dialing, I finally got through and waited on hold for 2 more hours. First of all, they couldn't even tell me why my flight was cancelled. Then they went on to tell me me they couldn't help me reschedule my flight, even from another airport and I was forced to miss my sister's bachelorette party.

2021-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Harrisburg to Punta Gorda,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,was the worst travel experience,True,"  I have flown all the major airlines for over the past 20 years. This was the first and list flight with Allegiant because they are cheap to Punta Gorda. Well you get what you pay for. They tout a sub-$100 flight however after all their fees, two round-trip tickets with carry-ons totaled $580. Other airline non-stops were the same price after all the nickel and diming from these clowns. Anyway, our flight was delayed 4 times. As we're driving to the airport, we kept getting notifications that the flight could move to an earlier time or delay further. After we board the plane, we see that the exit row seats we paid extra for were narrower than the other seats and the dividers could not be raised. We sat there for two hours while the pilot and co-pilot ran in and out of the plane trying to get a fuel pump to work. After two hours on the tarmac we finally take off for a 2:14A arrival time in Punta Gorda FL. During those two hours, not a single complimentary drink or snack was offered. They then came around and if you had their rewards card you could get a free soda. Otherwise you had to pay for a drink or snack. Without equivocation or hesitation I can easily say this was the worst travel experience in the last 25 years. I do not recommend this airline despite their touted savings. You WILL end up paying for it in in the end either monetarily, with delays, or discomfort.",-1

The people on my flight here were rude. The seat was uncomfortable. There was no space to hold anything. My flight is leaving late. They wanted to charge me $5 to get a ticket even though I wasn’t able to check in online because of them.

I never got onto the flight because of everything they put me through and all the hidden and extra fees they add on at the last minute almost giving you no choice. The best part about all of that is the fact that I canceled the Allegiant flight went right over to Delta saved over $200 flying comfort class with Delta They had the best customer service the flight stewardess the flight attendants even the captain was wonderful.

Flights cancelled due to ""weather"", after 11+ hours in an airport with kids bc they promised the flight isn't cancelled (our plane was on the ground). Pilot even stated there is no weather and why aren't we leaving. People waiting 4 hrs to check a bag?

2021-07-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Phoenix Mesa,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,the lack of cleaning,False,"  Allegiant is a ""no frills"" airlines which is definitely noticeable. This was our first time flying Allegiant and we did set our expectations low. Thankfully we did. First and foremost, let me say that no matter which airline you fly, the flight attendants should be welcoming and friendly. They were far from that on our flights. Don't bother to say hello because they will look through you. Secondly is the lack of cleaning. Allegiant wants to get their planes back in the air as quickly as possible. In order to do this, they refuse to clean the planes in between flights. You would think in a pandemic that they would be more thoughtful in their approach to cleanliness. As far as flying Allegiant again, not for us!",-1
2021-07-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Peoria,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Don't save $20 by flying this operational nightmare,False,"  They cancelled the flight because the plane was broken. They scheduled for the next day. No compensation. Rude people all along the way. I tried to help a lady in a wheelchair they abandoned. They left the next day, stranding everyone. They would not list the new secret flight in the airport. They would not put the name of the airline on a piece of paper to help people find it. They made no announcements about it. People had to go to the windows and find the plane. An hour after canceling the flight I went to their ticket counter and they would give me nothing even though the cancelation was their fault. They would not say why. Don't save $20 by flying this operational nightmare. Their seats are smaller than Frontier. Planes are filthy. Food served is stale and past exp date.",-1
2021-07-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,We will never book Allegiant ever again,False,"  Allegiant Air is the worst. Our original flight was delayed a few weeks out (understandable), but come the day of the flight it kept getting pushed back later and later which would have caused us to miss the pickup window for the camper we had planned to rent out of Denver. We tried calling the customer service number - it was always busy. We tried chatting online, there was no one to help us. We tried emailing - 2 weeks later we never got a response back. We had to be across the state the next day so the late flight wasn't an option. We ended up booking last minute with Delta and regret not booking with them in the first place. We will never book Allegiant ever again and will tell all of our friends about their horrible customer service. I understand that flights can be non-refundable, but at-least have someone answer the phone to tell me that.",-1
2021-07-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Bozeman,,,,,,1.0,1,never had such an awful experience,False,"  I have never had such an awful experience with an airline before. It is absolutely not worth to pay a few dozen dollars cheaper so an amazingly unprofessional company. My flight got canceled two hours before leaving, the customer service wait time on the phone had a two hour wait and the chat function doesn’t work. So we drove to the airport to speak to someone at the desk only to find an inexperienced attendant crying because she couldn’t help any of us. Couldn’t rebook anyone’s flights. Couldn’t give refunds. Didn’t know any policies. She promised cash vouchers besides our refunds so that people walk away from her and obviously that was a lie. Who runs this company? Management needs to take a hold of this train wreck fast",-1
2021-07-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fargo to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Never flying Allegiant again,True,"  My first time flying Allegiant was terrible. We were suppose to go to Nashville. First the flight got delayed, and then got delayed again before getting cancelled completely. Left many many people stranded and some not being able to see injured love one’s for the last time and such. I am 16 flying with a friend who is also 16 and we payed for this trip ourselves. We also relied on getting there last night at some point. If we didn’t have a family member in town we would have been screwed also considering it wasn’t an overnight stay airport. It was cheap, but in the long run was more expensive than Delta and United. Wish we would have just went Delta and United like we normally do. It’s almost ensured that they will get you there in a timely manner and safely. Never flying Allegiant again, and I am pretty sure they lost a whole plane full of customers.",-1
2021-07-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bozeman to Austin,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,It's not worth the stress,False,"  The old saying, you get what you pay for couldn't be any truer when it comes to Allegiant.  Our flight was cancelled an hour prior to take off. An hour! We were stranded as we were going home and the next available flight with Allegiant wasn't until two days from our original flight. They blamed the weather which was total BS. There was no other airline that cancelled flights that evening due to weather. We even checked with neighbors. Weather was fine! The flight there wasn't any better. Was supposed to take off at 7:30 pm - didn't take off until 10:30. Worthless! Got into Bozeman at 1 am. What a waste. This time it was mechanical issues. The navigation system in the plane kept turning off. My hubby and I were concerned that there was something seriously wrong with the plane. I am never booking a flight with Allegiant again. It's not worth the stress and you'll end up paying more money just to get home.",-1
2021-07-25,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Provo,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,Absolute worst service,False,  Absolute worst service. Flight canceled three times. Missed a family reunion. Spent over 3 hours on hold trying to get a refund. Airport hot and filthy. Not that cheap when you add baggage costs. They've canceled my flight before just as I arrived at the gate and I swore then if never use them again. I took a chance and got screwed.,-1

2021-07-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,El Paso to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,cancelled our flight back home,True,  They say they have cheap flights but you end up paying full price anyway. If you want a drink in flight you have to pay for it and on top of that they cancelled our flight back home. They don't answer phones and we had to go buy tickets from Frontier just to get back home. I don't even like giving them one star.,-1
2021-07-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4,customer service experience is very poor,False,"  Allegiant Air's customer service experience is very poor. If you attempt to contact them through their website, you fill out a form, then when you hit submit it says you are unauthorized to submit. There is a phone number, but when you dial in, it says the wait is more than 2 hours. There is no option to select to be called back.  Likewise, their technology does not work well. I modified a trip on their website to change a return flight and book a hotel and rental car. The itinerary they emailed was not consistent with what I purchased.",-1
2021-07-22,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to St. Petersburg,,,,,,1.0,1,No reimbursement for the inconvenience,False,"  I purchased ticket for my 11 year old granddaughter to fly from Knoxville to St. Petersburg, wwas told it was fine she just needed to bring her birth certificate and I would need to fill out paperwork showing who would be picking her up at other end. We get to airport at 4:30 AM only to be told she could not fly alone. Had to cancel her flight and pay 3 times as much so I could fly round trip with her tomorrow. No reimbursement for the inconvenience just had to change entire plan.",-1
2021-07-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Concord to St Petersburgh,,,,,,,1,never fly this airline again,True,  I will never fly this airline again.

I have no interest in their credit. Never will make this mistake again,-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Destin - Fort Walton to Boston,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,My feet were frozen,True," First they lost my golf clubs. There is no one on site to help or answer questions and cant get thru to anyone on the phone. They have 45 days to get back via email then they can decide how to handle past that. Then on the way to Florida, the emergency was whistling and I would see air coming in. They cleared the row and asked my row if we are OK still sitting there. My feet were frozen and I could see two holes at the bottom of the door (looked like daylight). I did take a picture of this. Very disturbing.",-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Fort Wayne to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,They refused to bring in a replacement plane and crew,True," On short notice Allegiant Air canceled my flight. Initially they said there would be a delay because a mechanic was needed. The delay expanded over 3 hours at which point the flight was canceled. They refused to bring in a replacement plane and crew. The entire treatment was not very transparent or caring and we lost half a day just sitting in the airport not to mention reclaiming our bags. By the way we booked only a few days prior and our fare was not discounted. It was ruinous of my trip and my time off. Never again will I fly out of Fort Wayne, nor will I fly Allegiant. Pathetic. Poor management.",-1
2021-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Stewart to Orlando Sanford,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory",True,"  We had an extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory experience with Allegiant. We have flown with many airlines, and when a situation arises for someone to give up their seat for monetary compensation, there is never an issue. We were to fly out July 9, from Stewart International Airport on flight 2278 to Sanford, FL. The flight was overbooked. Therefore, the gate agent started by requesting 3 volunteers to be bumped for $200 cash and a rebooked flight. No one offered including us. After a few minutes the gate agent announced the offer was now $400 and a rebooking. Again we did not offer nor did anyone else. A short time after, the gate agent announced an offer of $800 and a rebooking. This offer piqued our interest and the 3 members of our party volunteered. As we walked to the gate agent, other passengers commented to us they wish they could volunteer, but couldn’t  - comments were overheard exclaiming “$800 dollars cash, that would be nice”. We arrived to the gate agent, who we later came to know was the station manager. She was overwhelmed with the amount of people trying to get on the plane and asked us to hold tight and wait to “take care of us”. When the flight was all boarded with the gate doors closed and the plane pulling away, she commenced the process of arranging our compensation. To our shock and extreme disappointment, we soon received emails containing a link to only flight credits, and not the monetary compensation we were expecting. She simply shrugged us off and said we misunderstood her and the only option was the $200 cash or the flight credits. We insisted that she call again and tell them we were told $800 and not flight credit, however after getting off the phone, she told us take it or leave it, $200 in monetary compensation or the Flight credits, even telling us that no airline would give that much as compensation. This we know for a fact not to be true, as we have had previous experiences with other airlines (American, Delta, United, Jet blue) which have offered $400, $600 even up to $1200 for giving up a seat. At this point, apparently the state trooper was called, however we were at no time violent, not swearing, not being belligerent or yelling. We were strongly defending our position for what we and all the other passengers around the gate clearly understood was offered, $800 per passenger for the 3 seats that were needed. We insisted that the manager call again and tell the office we were not satisfied with the $200, she again stated we were wrong, and that we would never get more than the $200. We told her to call again and speak to a manager, which she finally did. The result was a $400 offer which we reluctantly accepted. There was an email that was supposed to come through, and she informed us just to leave and we would receive it within 15 minutes. Our trust in the airline had been clearly damaged, so we did not wish to leave until we received the email. She left us there telling us it would come through and that she was done. She walked away and left us with the state trooper to escort us out. This is how Allegiant repays their passengers who inconvenience themselves to allow the airline to carry on with the scheduled flight, give us less money and call the police to escort us away. The offer as was understood by all present at the gate was $800, now we were stuck in NY for 3 more days until our rescheduled flight",-1
2021-07-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Stockton,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,Fly another airline!,True,"  Flight was delayed, then boarding delayed once plane arrived, taxied for almost an hour, then when we finally arrived in Stockton, there was another Allegiant plane that had just arrived so we had to sit on plane! No apology or sense of hurry. I sent a complaint to Allegiant but never heard from them. I guess that’s just the way they do business. Fly another airline!",-1
2021-07-17,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Bellingham,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,Arrived without incident,True," Flight was delayed by a little over an hour, so it and these reviews had me nervous but after that there were no further delays, both the pilot and crew were very apologetic and actually got us there faster than estimated. Space is a bit tight but paid way less than the next airline so it wasn't an issue (for me at least). Arrived without incident and am about to board my flight back now (which is on time and has the friendliest pilot who's been chatting with us and other passengers). Overall, the delay wasn't too bad, they gave a 5 hour heads up so I wasn't even at the airport yet and the rest of the trip was comfortable!",1

You get what you pay for! 4 hour flight turned into 8 hours. One thing after another. Here we are on the return trip and now we're delayed again! I have flown all over the world. The is the worst airline ever!,-1
2021-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft. Lauderdale to Cincinnati,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst experience traveling in my 48 years,False,"  Our family will never fly Allegiant again. Delayed leaving in addition to long lines to check baggage. Once on the plane, duct tape on the overhead baggage bins and a broken bathroom. No food because “they’ve been flying all day”. Sat on the ground for two hours due to a storm. Then, sat another two hours at baggage claim because all of their workers left for the evening and didn’t finish the luggage for three of their flights. We just left the airport at 3am frustrated. Worst experience traveling in my 48 years.",-1
2021-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Florida to Arkansas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have ever flown,False,  The worst airline I have ever flown. Not trustworthy at all.

2021-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando Sanford to Newburgh,,,,,,,1,would not recommend airline,False,  Airline was cancelled with no reason and no flight out for several days.

Flights are often delayed or cancelled very last minute,-1

We were supposed to arrive at 8 15 but we did not get go Fll until 1 am. Never mind on the Way to Fll to Asheville we had similar issues. Avoid this airline at all cost.",-1
2021-07-16,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,an intolerable experience,False,"  If you like delays and all things slow, this airline is for you. You'll enjoy multiple unexplained delays, equipment issues and staff that could be friendlier and on top of their game. Seriously though, my wife and I flew Allegiant on 7/15 and we were delayed 3 times for unknown reasons. Then, when everyone was on board and we were seemingly ready to push away from the gate, a problem with one of the tires was discovered and the plane had to be deboarded and all carry on luggage removed. This was our fourth delay of the night. Finally, everyone was back on board and each step of the process to get in the air took longer than I have ever experienced for such a small airport. Its not like we were 10th in line for take off or anything. The entire experience was very frustrating and that is not the way air travel has ever been for me before on Delta, United or AA. If you're after a stressful experience, cramped seating and less than enthusiastic Crews, this is your low cost best bet. My apologies for the sarcasm but really this was an intolerable experience unlike any other flight I have been on in my 30+ years of travel.",-1
2021-07-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Orlando Sanford,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,2,never flying Allegiant Air again,False,"  Ridiculous, problem after problem. On the departure flight it kept getting postponed 3 times with no information. Once we finally boarded, there was some sort of issue where we had to sit for nearly an hour on the plane before taking off. On the way back, it got delayed again. Once we finally arrived back home, there were no gates open!! Seriously, get your stuff together! We had to sit on the tarmac forever waiting to find a gate and deplane. I’m never flying Allegiant Air again.",-1

Then on the intercom they announced that the flight was cancelled. We are a family of 4 with 2 kids. This was horrible, there was no one to help us. We had a hotel booked and had family meeting us. Now we are on our way to another airport and are flying. Not only did we not get a refund but they gave us vouchers for their airline. I will never fly Allegiant Air ever again. We had no help, it was way too stressful and put a dint in our plans and vacation. I’m extremely annoyed that we didn’t even have help to find other flights.",-1

Text messages were changing times and gates, gate agent was yelling “pay attention”. Just a disaster. First time flying as I’m Platinum with Delta and tried Allegiant. My ticket was not cheap and every single aspect of the Allegiant experience was awful.",-1
2021-07-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,El Paso to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst mistake ever,False,"  I never heard of this airline but took a chance. Worst mistake ever. They cancelled my son's return flight less than 24 hours before departure with no reason explained. Spent several hours on the phone and was not able to talk to anyone. They sent me a credit voucher for future flight which was unbelievable. I used American Express so I will get charge taken off. This airline is pathetic and I would never take a chance with them again. Thankfully, I purchased travel insurance and will get reimbursed but my son almost didn't make it back and for that reason I will never book with them again.",1
2021-07-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sandford to Portsmouth,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,canceled our flight home,False,"  Terrible experience on both ends.

2021-07-14,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bloomington to Destin/Fort Walton Beach,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3.0,2,return flight had been cancelled,False,"  Our family vacation flight from Illinois to Florida was nearly perfect. However, three days into our trip and two days before we were to leave, we received a text message saying that our return flight had been cancelled with no replacement options. I spent nearly an entire day of my vacation scrambling to find another way for my family to return home, and ended up spending $800 more dollars to get home. We were able to get a refund on our original tickets, which was a relatively easy experience, but we are out $800 dollars and a day of vacation and won’t get that back.",-1
2021-07-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Des Moines to Austin,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,Next time we’ll stick with a real airline,True," First flight on Allegiant and will be our last. Airline had overbooked the flight by 6 seats. Announced at the gate that we would not board until there were 6 volunteers to accept a payout. The next flight to Austin on this airline is four days from now! Would not board. Then we boarded the plane already late. However the crew couldn’t reconcile the passenger count with “the home office”. This was another 75 minute delay. Not mechanical, not weather - a simple passenger count. Seats were awful - think grandma’s dining room chairs that force one to sit up straight. Service was grudgingly done early in the flight - even water was not complimentary. When we arrived in Austin, the terminal was like something in a banana republic. Booked this for the direct flight. Next time we’ll stick with a real airline.",-1
2021-07-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Allegiant did not accommodate the displaced passenger,True," Unfortunately this may have been our last trip to ever fly with Allegiant. On Sunday, 7/10 we were suppose to fly from Las Vegas to San Antonio. Early that morning we were notified our flight was delayed an hour, no big deal. When we get to the airport and board, we are notified we have to deboard the plane for maintenance, no big deal. However, once we are off the plane we were not given any update for about 30 minutes. Finally we are told we'll be boarding around 5.30pm. Our original delayed depart time was 3.30pm. Once we are back on the plane, we remain at the gate for about 35-40 minutes with no update. We eventually leave the gate, maybe take one lap around the airport and the pilot let's us know the computers are having issues related to the heat outside. A few minutes later, he says we cannot take this aircraft to San Antonio and all the passengers receive a notification that we'll be leaving from a different gate. Fine, no big deal. Everyone is under the impression we are changing planes and will be on our way. They ask everyone to deboard again, and wait until everyone is off to inform us that our flight has been cancelled. It is now close to 8pm, 10pm central time in Texas. There are no flights coming back to Las Vegas tonight that will be returning to Texas. Because Allegiant waited so long to call it quits, about 4 people were able to jump to another airline and get home Sunday evening. We ended up having to spend over double what we paid round trip for a Southwest flight the next morning to go one way. We were also forced to find a place to stay because Allegiant did not accommodate the displaced passengers. It was ultimately a stressful and exhausting 24 hours due to the lack of communication from the Allegiant crew on the ground. Many people may have been able to find better accommodations that were not ridiculously expensive had our flight been cancelled much earlier. After returning home, we spend over 4 hours on hold just to talk to someone about the refund process. My first and last Allegiant experience was such a let down and exceptionally disappointing across the board.",-1

We booked our flights with Allegiant a couple of weeks ago, this morning July 11th and we were supposed to fly out of Des Moines Iowa at 7 but they canceled our flight at 2.30 this morning, we fortunately got a flight at 1.30 in Omaha. We drove to Omaha and when we got there, there were no staff at our terminal check in. We eventually boarded and sat down and then waited an extra hour to fly out. While we were waiting we sat next down to this very nice gentleman, he had his mask on and all and took it off for food, a couple of minutes later the attendant asked for him to get off the plane and was escorted out without explanation.",-1

Departing flight was delayed 3 hours, returning flight was cancelled with no options given as a return! My family and I were stranded in Florida with no way home. We spent one entire day of our vacation trying to find a way home! We ended up finding a return flight 2 hours away from where we flew out of. We incurred an extra $200 just in fees for last minute tickets and rental car fees above and beyond an extra $500 we had to shell out last minute for a flight home for 4 of us. Not to mention, having to find a ride home from flying in 2 hours away from where our car was at the departing Airport. My refund is now 12 days over due and no one will answer the phone at Allegiant. I've waited on hold for 2-3 hours to no avail. They owe me $460 that has yet to be refunded. I'm starting to lose my patience with this airline. As I said, do not use them and avoid this nightmare! I wish I could have them a -100 because 1 star is still being generous!",-1

He was allowed to fly home for a week to celebrate. He went back to fly him, his wife and 2 children home to find out after getting to the airport right before they were to board the plane they cancelled the flight. They rescheduled him to Houston instead of Austin where his car was. They didn't let him know there were no rental cars in the Houston airport due to this COVID-19. He simply wanted a refund so he could book a flight with another airline. Only to be told that he would have to call some number that had a wait time of 3 hours.

While my husband was on the line with customer service I was booking another flight to get to our son, thank goodness Delta has one the same day, he stayed on the line for 4 hours and someone hung up on him, I have emailed them everyday with no responses.

2021-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Eugene,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly Allegiant again,False,"  Worst airline experience I've ever had, and this is my first time flying since COVID. My flight was originally scheduled to depart 6:21pm on Friday. I paid $65 for an Uber to take me to LAX and I get there 2 hours early. With less than 2 hours to go they cancel my flight and reschedule it for the following day, Saturday at 4:21pm. I tried calling Allegiant but after almost 2 hours on hold, I finally gave up. Then on Saturday I'm on my way to LAX again, also trying to be 2 hours early and I get an alert that my flight is delayed. I'm leaving this review while stuck at the airport waiting for my delayed, rescheduled flight and I have little confidence that I'll even get on this plane today. I've now spent more money on Uber going back and forth to the airport than the cost of my plane ticket. I will never fly Allegiant again and I suggest you stay away too.",-1

I am done with them. 3 hour delays, possible cancellations, destination reservations needed to be canceled and no refundable.

Called numerous times and received no answer. One of those calls I was on hold for two hours. In January I needed to cancel a flight from Allentown Pennsylvania to Fort Lauderdale Florida. It was a $157 flight which I paid in September 2020. Upon trying to make another flight last month they did not credit my $157 for payment even though I had cancelled the January flight. Truly disgusted. So am I supposed to assume I am out $157?,-1

She didn’t even look at our tickets long enough to recognize that we had TSA precheck. There’s no reason to be so mean to 14 year old or his mother. If you don’t like your job get another one!

Customer service was atrocious and blatantly inconsiderate. Check-in clerks covering one check-in counter with approximately 60 to 80 people in wait for baggage check in. There is no savings in opting for this airline. Do not recommend this for any traveler!,-1

Flight was delayed until cancellation due to weather but was allowing other flights to land and take off. The following day the flight had an engine issue and they tried fixing it right in front of everyone’s eyes at the gate and had us waiting for almost 12 hours and only gave us an $8 food voucher when the food court cost minimum $16 for one meal. I didn’t even use it because the fine print said “accepting this, you cannot reach out to Allegiant for other issues”. They finally sent a different aircraft after being delayed overall 18 hours and ruined 2 days of my vacation. If I could give 0 stars I would!",-1

Flight was 2 hrs late arriving and then had toilet issue. 5 hrs later we all still waiting at the gate. A lot of young families with tired and grumpy children are having the biggest problems but it's super frustrating for all of us. Not worth the few dollars we saved. We will never fly this airline again.,-1
2021-07-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Fort Walton,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never had an airline cancel a flight and refuse to help,True," We’ve had our flight booked for weeks. We were planning on leaving at 6.45am this morning, but awoke to a message that was sent at 3am saying the flight was canceled. There was no explanation for it and there were no other flights going out today. We’ve spent hundreds of dollars for the hotel and flight there and back. Two adults having taken off a week of work where PTO is scarce. I spent 2 hours on hold with Allegiant customer service and never got to talk to a real person. After years of flying I have never had this happen. I’ve never had an airline cancel a flight and refuse to help after the fact. I will never mess around with Allegiant again, I’d rather spend a few extra hundred dollars on a reputable airline to ensure my vacation isn’t ruined before it starts!",-1
2021-07-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Do not recommend this airline,False,  The last 4 times I’ve flown with Allegiant Air my flights been delayed. Not a 30 minute delay but multiple hours delay. This time it got delayed when we were suppose to be boarding. They delayed the flight for 2 hours and couldn’t give a reason why. The delay now is costing me a half day of PTO due to them delaying the flight. You can never rely on Allegiant to get you to your destination on time. The worst part even though they know all the flights have been delayed I don’t get a refund discount or anything. Seems like they play it off and act like it’s just normal to always have flights delayed. Very annoyed and will likely never fly with Allegiant unless I have too. Do not recommend this airline.,-1

It's steadily declined in recent years. Yesterday, 7/3/21, the flight was first delayed prior to flight time. Ok. These things are to be expected. Next, we were unable to land due to another plane being at the gate. We then waited for over an hour (around 9:30-10:45) at baggage claim. The icing on the cake was that the handle of my suitcase is broken! Completely careless!",-1
2021-07-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Syracuse,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,worst airline in the United States,False,"  Allegiant Air is the worst airline in the United States. The have absolutely no care for passengers, even including their boarding, the cleanliness of the aircraft, the extremely tiny vinyl covered seats with very limited legroom, and normally no advance announcements of are the known conditions which delays a flight. Allegiant requires you to pay for any seat choice, and if you do not choose and pay for a seat, they will give you the worst seat to encourage you to pay for a better seat. Last year at the height of covid, on one of my flights there were 17 rows of three seats with no passengers, but in spite of that they chose a seat where the entire row including my sea was full. Talk about not caring about covid transmission, eight months before the first vaccines were available. I have an upcoming flight, and with Hurricane Elsa possibly coming close to impact my home in Fort Lauderdale, so last night July 2, 2021, I wanted to ask about changing my outgoing flight from Syracuse to July 4th, instead of July 8th, and called customer service, and after three hours and thirty minutes, was on hold, with the volume low on speaker, so I could continue to enjoy other activities, and finally just gave up, but proof of their horrible customer service. While on hold, I made three attempts to use the chat service, and each time no agents were available. Lets also not forget that Allegiant has a very substantial background of mechanical failures that delay or cancel flights. Also, many times if you have a computer, with lets say Windows 7, you cannot even book a flight, as their IT people are not intelligent enough to match any other airline in the world, where you can book online.",-1

Unbeknownst to me, checking in bags are free for veterans. For the past week after returning, I've tried multiple times to get a hold of someone that may be able to help. So far, their number always seems to be busy, no one seems to be available for a live chat, and all 3 of my emails have not been responded to. I get that I made the mistake. However 2 gate agents have told me to contact Allegiant and they will gladly work with me to get refunded. Doesn't appear to happen anytime soon, so I'll just write a review to warn of Allegiants lack of customer support.",-1
2021-07-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Sioux Falls,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,pathetic excuse for an airline,False,"  Absolutely pathetic excuse for an airline, this is my first time flying with this airline. They are cheap, which should have been the first red flag, but I guess you get what you pay for. Boarding started an hour late. No announcement as to why. No communication. No one was even at the desk. After an hour late, we finally boarded. Keep in mind this is July 2021 coming off a pandemic. I go to my seat, and there was half-eaten cookie/pretzels all over the seats and floor in front of us. No one vacuumed or sanitized between flights. When brought to the attention of the flight attendant to see if i could switch seats, she just said ""sorry, it's a full flight."" did not offer to help clean anything up or even act like she cared. So i used hand sanitizer & kleenex from my carry-on to try to clean my backrest the best i could. Spent the whole 2.5 hour flight leaning forward, with my feet in who knows what.",-1

First flight was scheduled to leave June 29th, I missed my flight, my flight was leaving at 10.13am, I checked my luggage in and thought they gave me my boarding pass, went to TSA they said I didn't have a boarding pass. I'm 85 years old and don't understand very well how all this technology works, so I told them the pass is on my phone and would they help me with it, they said they couldn't and the flight already left, this all happened at 9.30 am flight boards at 9.28 and door closes at 9.58. I was marked down as a no show, but my luggage made it to Sanford. They did scheduled me to fly out the next day. I was waiting for the flight to leave then it was delayed due to weather. After several delays and several excuses the flight was canceled. I sat in McAllen Airport from 5pm until 3am. Come to find out there were no weather issues, no mechanical issues, it was because they didn't have a crew to fly the plane. Allegiant lies about everything. Now I'm trying to get my luggage back with all my medications. Don't trust Allegiant! I will never use them again. Allegiant is based out of Nevada, I guess you pay the money and take your chances!",-1

They tacked on over $269 in additional funds which brought the total ticket and car package way over costs we thought we were going to be paying. We purposely selected this airline due to the advertised rates. We are used to honest and transparent costs with other airlines. What you book is the final cost. Not so with Allegiant. After our return of rental car, they charged us ""additional fees"" and did not give us a receipt with breakdown. They said it would be emailed. It was not. I have taken hours of ""hold"" time to speak to a representative to get a breakdown of costs and still haven't gotten through.",-1

To be fair they offer the flexible plan but that is after the terms of service say “you can cancel within 24 hours of purchase”.",-1

I have flown for 30 years and have flown every airline in the USA and most in Europe and this airline is a total joke. I see they get a 3/10 and honestly don't know how hey get that high of rating. I honestly would not fly them for free and for me that is really saying something.,-1

We arrived at the airport four hours prior to take off. Half of the plane ride was still in line to go through TSA. The plane delayed for a short few and then departed. Once we got through TSA we rebooked for a later flight. That flight was then cancelled. The next flight did not leave until later the next day. We had to spend the night at the airport on the floor with disabled member in our family. We chose to fly into Indy so we wouldn't have to wait until later the following day. We had to find a ride from Indy to CVG where our luggage was shipped. We spent over an extra $400 to feed the family at the airport and extra day of parking in long term at CVG. Allegiant was not accommodating at all. I would not recommend flying with them in the future!,-1

We reach maybe a thousand feet and being so low the plane is shaking. No one is communicating to us. It was terrifying. Later when the pilot finaly did talk with the passengers he spoke of a wind shift making us unable to land ... just saying some earlier communication would have appreciated. People were crying and praying, yelling requesting info, it was just a lot for a ""wind shift"".",-1
2021-06-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cincinnati,,,,,,,1,Worst airline ever,False,  Worst airline ever.  We have family and for the 2nd time they have cancelled their flight!

My daughter missed her grandma’s funeral because Allegiant told her there was a weather advisory. My daughter will be 18 in three months. The website says anyone older than 15 is considered an adult. They told her that there was a heat wave advisory for Lancaster which is in the desert not even within the vicinity of L.A it was dropped at 9pm, which was the time of her flight from Indianapolis, and since she was a minor she could not fly. The agent took her phone and went through her emails to check for confirmation, which was never sent. They laughed when she walked away. I asked if they could hire someone to accompany her as the website says but the agent told me that they didn't do that. What a waste of time, money, and energy, emotions. They told her they could reschedule in July. What a joke and very irresponsible. I tried calling but no one would answer. Horrible company. Spirit for now on.",-1

Due to that they manually count all passengers. It took an hour to count all the passengers. 85% of passengers were very tired and started calling for just “water”. The flight attendant got bad and started responding rudely to some of the passengers. However, no water was provided.  They did not allow anyone to get out of the flight to buy food, according to the flight attendants if you step out you can not return to the flight. However, we did not have any knowledge of when the flight will be ready to depart. The departure time was 5:05 pm we stayed with terrible services with no water till 7: 50pm",-1

I booked a flight with Allegiant Air and within 10 min. of booking the flight I realized I had booked a flight in the middle of the night and thought it was an afternoon flight. I cancelled that flight within 10 min. of booking it. I had to book with another airline to get to my Mom in a time so I could be picked up by family. I called the customer service line several times and they never answered...in fact the customer service line doesn't even go through, it just rings a few times and hangs up. I had to look up their corporate office number and have them connect me. They refuse to give me my money back! $195.00 for a mistake that was realized within 10 min. Of booking! I can not believe this company. I do not fly often about every 5 years or so. They refuse to give me a refund for a flight reservation that was canceled with 10 min. of making it.

The aircraft was very clean and comfortable and the equipment was more than expected. The flight crew were very informative. They were nice and caring and went beyond the call of their duties. We rode flight 2240 outbound and then on our return trip we rode 2247 back to Tri Cities. On both flights I will give the all a 10+ for their service and commitment. It was our first flight with Allegiant and we look forward to many many more to come. Keep up the good work Allegiant.,1

The level of organizational ineptitude is indescribable. But I'm not sure what was worse, the abysmally poor communication during the debacle that was flight #1733 from Concord to Fort Lauderdale on June 20 that finally departed on June 21 or the entitled school marm attitude of their flight attendants. I guess I would go with the poor communication. They had to know that the flight was going to be canceled at the time they sent out the delay message. FAA regulations dictated that decision and a second grade math skill level would have let you know you were going to exceed the pilot flight time limitation. And the staff handling of the situation and lack of communication during the episode was so bad that it deserves to be in case studies on how NOT to handle that situation. The staff failed at every level. They should be ashamed and embarrassed. Absolutely disgusting, disgraceful, and disappointing.",-1

I instantly after numerous tries of trying to book her flight got on the phone and live chat and was not able to reach customer service for help in booking her flight successfully, then live chat wasted my time and said my only option was to get through by phone to add her to my return flight. Moving forward 5 days, multiple phone calls and a ton of wasted hours with no success of getting a human on the phone I had to drive an hour to the airport to confirm I wasn’t loosing money, to be told I would be paying an extra $200 and that there was no other options. I’m severely turned off and will never fly this airline ever again! What’s going on with customer service, all around disgusted. Fly Delta or any other airline.

New crew had to be called in delaying it again til 9.30. One called in sick cancelling the flight after we had waited 8 hrs to make sure it’s all good. Last chance was the next morning at 8am. All was finally well with this departure until we arrived to Destin and now have waited over an hour to even pick up our luggage.

Of course, we were already through security at that time. Had to wait around at the gate. Finally started boarding at 8.00am. The boarding process was chaotic with anyone lining up and boarding regardless of Zone. I was in Zone 2 and 2/3 of the plane was already in line and boarded ahead of me. Apparently there was an issue with the pilot and they had to call another pilot to come in. He lives across the state and wouldn’t be at the plane for an hour and a half after our delayed departure time. They boarded everyone regardless (they knew of the issue) and had us sit on the plane two more hours waiting for a new pilot. Horrible.",-1
2021-06-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Nashville tn to Saint Petersburg FL,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They don't care about their customers whatsoever,True," I have been sitting in this airport for 7 hours now with no updates, no apologies, no vouchers. Everyone in this airport is extremely upset and we have only been told that there was mechanical issues and it would be an hour delay. Then delayed 2 more times. They said they are sending a plane from Florida and come to find out it wasn't even in the air yet. They said they can't do anything and we will have to call customer service. I've been on hold for 1 hour and hung up on once before after waiting 45 min the first time. They don't care about their customers whatsoever. Kids are crying, people are missing their rides, and we need to go to work in the morning. After people asked to speak to a manager calmly, the one and only employee in this airport called the police. They were nicer and more informative than he was! Ridiculous, rude and costing us time money and suffering.",-1
2021-06-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Austin,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,compete absence of communication,False,  Horrible management of passenger loading in Austin. Staff can not give passengers any information on loading time. Very poor management of a late flight making the situation much worse than it needed to be. No consideration to help passengers social distance due to compete absence of communication.,-1
2021-06-07,0.1,Business,Business Class,Fort Lauderdale to Syracuse,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,excuse after excuse and apology after apology,False,"  They dropped the size of the airplane leaving the flight overbooked on a smaller airplane. Offering $300 then $400 voucher for another flight (until they told people when their next flight was and that was 4 days later) (A) Don’t stop start boarding the plane if your going to stop it because you want to continue to offer the same amount to people over and over and over. (B) Common sense would say to put someone on another plane as another option at the same time so you would have to pay the voucher on top of that! But you offered the voucher, then those that accepted you tried to negotiate giving them less of a voucher while everyone is sitting waiting to board and leave! (Now 20 minutes behind schedule) a gentleman disrespects a lady, he was acknowledged and spoken to by an employee yet you let him board the plane? Yet again no common sense! You allow us all to sit 30 more minutes on the plane and yup take that guy off the plane! (50 minutes behind schedule) Finally get rolling but we are second in line and 1 hour behind schedule we are in the air! Instead of being cheap and not using a brain you will lose several people from this flight as I personally came into Florida with 7 others on this flight for a poker tournament. Not that we personally need anything nor wanted anything, the fact nothing (not even a dam bottle of water was offered) just a dragged out apology and excuse after excuse and apology after apology, when it only would have taken was commonsense. This company blows my mind and that was the last straw and a disgusting display of business!",-1
2021-06-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newawk to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,It's not worth it at all. Just spend the money,False,"  If you're here you're probably considering using Allegiant to save some money on your next trip. Nope. Don't do it. Don't cheap out. All of the negative press is real. There is quite literally a ""60-Minutes"" documentary episode on how bad Allegiant Air is. Their booking systems are a mess. There were four attendants checking people in, all four of the people in front of us had separate issues they couldn't resolve. The return flights were all canceled the morning of stranding us there. Not a drop of rain or bad weather at either airport. We later found out all Allegiant Air from that and connecting airports seemingly randomly canceled. When we arrived at an airport someone who knew told us their tech systems had totally failed or something and that it was a common occurrence. We got a refund of a tiny fraction of the cost of our tickets (legal?). In order to receive the refund we needed to use a sketchy third party website and enter our full bank routing information (feel confident about giving them your full bank into after all I mentioned?). We ended up driving back home 800+ miles, entertaining ourselves with news stories about how Allegiant Air screwed over customers. And what's crazy is that we were home long before our content ran out. Anyways - back to you. You're looking at saving $250-$350 vs Delta or American or something. Don't do it. It's not worth it at all. Just spend the money.",-1
2021-06-06,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,horrible experience with Allegiant,True,"  I had a horrible experience with Allegiant. My flight was at 3:08 on June 5, I arrive at the gate after checking me, my brother, my son, and our pet puppy in once at the gate their was this lady there who stated that I can’t get on last minute because the dog was on a hard sided cage where on the websites it’s said both is okay and I spend 2 hour on the phone the previous day to get a representation on the phone to add the dog and was also told it was okay. She had no sympathy she gave me short blunt answers and didn’t even offer a alternative or a apology once I ask her what I can do she stated I can purchase the soft sides one but she’s closing the gate. Before this whole incident happen I spoke to her before where she saw the dog in the cage and didn’t say nothing and when the incident happen I ask to speak to higher up since she was a supervisor but she said there’s no one else I can speak to. Long story short I was denied access on the plane and my sister had to drive 1:39 min back to come get me to go home. Allegiant pet policy All pets must be transported in a soft-sided or hard-sided enclosed leak-proof carrier",-1
2021-06-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Concord,,,,,,1.0,1,straight up cancelled the flight,False,"  I drove to Ft Lauderdale for my Allegiant flight. Initially they delayed my flight for 2 hours then straight up cancelled the flight. I noticed a pattern with Allegiant. Just before they cancel a flight, all workers disappear so you have no one to talk to. I called their 800 number and they told me there would be a flight out of an airport 3 hours away at 6am the next morning. I drove the three hours and at 5am, the workers all disappeared. A moment later, the flight was cancelled. This is the second time they have cancelled my weekend trip to see my grandkids. Their cheap flights aren't worth the headache of cancelations.",-1

Horrible customer service, delayed flight and small plane. The workers at Niagara Falls were disrespectful and not helpful. Staff are not welcoming and talk back when dealing with complaints. I will never use this airline ever again (there are plenty of better options that are just as affordable). Also you have to pay for every little thing, you’re nickel and dimed over everything (which most cheap airlines do). My bag was okay and a few others but my fiancé’s wasn’t even though I have used it since I was 10 on flights before!",-1
2021-06-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,JAX to BLV,,,,,,,1,costly and just total abandonment,False,  They cancelled our flight on Thursday and said they were not rescheduling the flight and that we could rebook on their next flight for Sunday! They offered no hotel/food voucher. They did not help with luggage transfer or information for other flights. We had to last minute book with Southwest which was expensive last minute. It was costly and just total abandonment. Do yourself a favor and book Southwest the first time around! It will save you more in the end!,-1

Just spend the extra money and fly with a more personable staff! I asked to switch to an empty row right in front of me (after the doors closed) and was told no! I was taking a work phone call prior to takeoff and the male flight attendant told me to get off of the phone as if he has speaking to his child. They nickel and dime you for everything. We paid so much in baggage fees that it was ridiculous. Not to mention they are the only airline who has a 40 pound bag limit - my bag was 43 pounds and they made me pay $100.,-1

I bring my backpack plus a cross over wallet not even a purse I mean a wallet. They tried making me pay 50.00 for something that fits in my pocket. Pathetic! Not to mention the ladies were quite rude. Also they put my kids car seat ""small booster seat"" on someone else's walker yet everyone is so concerned about covid and wanting to take precautions per them not me like they care so much but let's throw your child's booster on someone's walker. I've never been so dissatisfied ever while flying. My family and I will not be traveling Allegiant any further, there's 11 of us every time and we will be going elsewhere. When we left Flint we had zero issues but leaving Florida was sickening.",-1
2021-05-14,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portsmouth to Punta Gorda,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3,problem was the customer service portion,False,"  The flight down to Florida was acceptable without incident. The flight crew were courteous and proficient. The problem was the customer service portion. I am a veteran and the airline claims military courtesy for luggage cost which is all well, but if you get charged and try calling the customer care number for reimbursement you can forget about getting through. I have called 4 times and the wait times have been anywhere from 25 to 40 minutes without a response. It appears the number given is going to a dead line.",1
2021-05-12,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Richmond,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,flight attendant was very rude,True,"  The flight attendant was very rude, I was very sick due to motion sickness. I asked the flight attendant, whom was sitting on her cell phone, in the back of the plane, doing absolutely nothing, if I could find a seat closer to the front of the plane. She asked me to pull up my mask as I continued to throw up, Im not sure how this is possible, but what do I know? She rudely informed me to sit in my seat and that nothing could be done to help me. I found this extremely inconsiderate being that other passengers were trying to help me, by giving me bags to throw up in, yet she did nothing but sit on her butt and scroll instagram. Perhaps simply getting off your phone and doing your job would be sufficient, rather than leaving a passenger on the floor of the plane throwing up.",-1
2021-05-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Sanford,,,,,,,1,Absolutely terrible experience,False,  Absolutely terrible experience. I recommend everyone avoid Allegiant at all cost. Allegiant canceled our flight with no rescheduled flight for 4 days. We rented a car and drove 3 other people from our flight home. After a month of trying to reach out to Allegiant I had to Facebook message them to get a response! They are not reimbursing us for the cost of the car and only providing a voucher for the flight instead of a reimbursement. Customer service staff were terrible.,-1

Will never fly in this terrible airline that nickles and dimes you to death. The seats are uncomfortable, the delay going was an hour, coming home was 4 hours, vouchers given were not accepted for food in the airport. Turbulence was terrible. Staff were borderline rude. Spend the money and go to Southwest or any other airline.",-1
2021-05-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Flint to Nashville,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,This was the very worst,False,  Never fly this 1.5 hrs after touching ground I still did not have my luggage I called customer support to deal with all types of ghetto. This was on top of being delayed 40 mins and not being able to find anyone at my gate and than landing and waiting a extra hour for them to find a gate to let us out at. This was the very worst.,-1
2021-05-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Pete/Tampa to Stewart International,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,proceeded to remove me from the plane,True,"  Was harassed by flight attendant as soon as I got on the plane about my mask with a filter on it told me that wasn’t a regulation mask. I proceeded to tell her that if the mask that you’re wearing can see light through it that the virus can pass through it. I said that on my seat proceeded to open up my yogurt to eat it I was done harassed about not wearing a mask then they sent somebody over there to tell me to put a mask on even though I was eating. He returned to the plane saying that I was asked to be removed being that I was disruptive and not following the rules even though I was eating they still proceeded to remove me from the plane and told me that it’s because I was being disruptive and causing people to be unsafe. The person trying to remove me from the plane was not wearing a mask properly, the irony of the situation is just unreal, Horrible flight service, horrible flight attendants, never recommend this airline to anybody",-1
2021-05-02,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Sanford to Clinton National,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1,getting worse and worse,True,"  I fly Allegiant often and because each experience is getting worse and worse I’m going to start reviewing each flight. Last week I flew allegiant from lit to sfb and got to spend an entire sunny day stuck inside an airport for a 12 hour delay. Today, a week later, I’m sitting on the runway writing this. Been here for an hour past departure so far. The plane is half empty and I am crammed in a row with two other people. After seeing some fellow passengers move to other seats to allow for possible social distancing, I proceeded to do the same. The whole row at the back of the plane had no one in it. I made my way back to it (2 rows behind my current position mind you) and was met with the most rude female flight attendant I’ve ever experienced who would not allow me to take one of the many empty seats to give myself and other passengers social distance. A very disrespectful person. Unfortunately I’ll be flying this airline again, but I’ll be sure to review each flight to bring awareness to “you get what you pay for” I guess it’s too much to ask for a flight attendant who can respectfully communicate or for a reliable flight schedule.",-1
2021-05-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,None wearing masks,True,  Unruly passengers in the terminal group of about 10. None wearing masks. They were then allowed to board flight and did not wear masks. It took at least 5 people close to where I was sitting to complain to stewards before the asked passengers to wear masks. Passengers continued to ignore them. Pilots announced it. Passengers allowed to leave plane with no consequences.,-1
2021-04-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Springfield,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,pay for every piece of luggage,True,"  First off I purchased the ticket not knowing you have to pay for every piece of luggage, the cost does not even cover 1 checked baggage. You would be better off buying from the other airlines because if you have to pay for luggage you will end up spending twice the amount. I paid $270 for the ticket and the baggage cost me another $140, I found tickets for another airline for $325 and I know that covers a checked bag. I only checked 1 bag instead of 2 and now the airline wants to only give me a credit for the difference when the girl at the counter told me that I could call customer service and they could issue a refund. I called customer service and they told me credit only for my next flight, well they charge for drinks and snacks, even water, there is no on-flight entertainment, and their staff is not friendly. Why would I even fly with you again. No I do not want a credit because I would never use your airline.",-1
2021-04-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pasco to Mesa,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,I just want to use my promo,False,"  TSA and check gate employees were rude - even to elderly passengers and veterans! Terrible. Also, I'm currently trying to book a flight for a friend using my promo code from Allegiant in my email. Flight dates align with promo requirements, it's good until midnight tonight, and no destinations are mentioned in promo details. Yet, the Allegiant site says it's expired! Called the number for Allegiant and had a rude rep answer. Called a different number and have been on hold for 35 minutes! I just want to use my promo .. went ahead and purchased the flight, writing this while on hold, and will ask where else to leave a bad review.",-1
2021-04-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I wasted more money and time by flying this airline,False,"  Awful Spokane to Las Vegas. Flight was at 2.45. Didn't leave till 5. Did role call, head count. Some people didn't even get their names called. Nobody knew what was going on. Rescheduled 4 different times. Even the pilot came out and asked what they were doing. The airport staff even said, ""what are you doing?, we checked in all 120"". The lady that checked in from the terminal didn't even check how many people were with us. Literally anyone could have just gone on the plane with us. Sat on plane for over an hour. Be careful with budget airlines. It bites back and we lost our time and the tickets I bought for a show in Vegas are non refundable. I wasted more money and time by flying this airline.",-1
2021-04-18,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Fort Wayne, IN to St. Petersburg, FL",4.0,,3.0,,,2.0,3,They rescheduled our flight for 27 hours later,False,"  On a Saturday night we were booked to go to Florida from Fort Wayne, IN. The incoming flight had turbulence and a flight attendant injured her leg. After waiting a couple of hours, they cancelled our flight. They rescheduled our flight for 27 hours later on Sunday evening. After waiting a long time, we finally got our luggage back. They had assigned one college aged girl to take care of all of us with the new flight and the luggage. We found an early Sunday morning flight in Grand Rapids, MI so we drove 3 hours there and got a hotel and flew out early Sunday. Our loss was one night of payment on our Florida condo as well as a whole day of our vacation. Our gas money to Grand Rapids and the hotel in Grand Rapids. Allegiant says it's not their fault and we can't get refunded for anything. I would be happy if they would at least pay for our hotel. Now I understand why all the people in the line were saying ""Allegiant has done this before, but this is the last time. I won't fly Allegiant again"".",-1
2021-04-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Cincinnati,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never book a flight with Allegiant again,False,"  I can't say enough bad things about this airline. How they still operate is beyond me. They delayed my flight multiple times making me leave at 1140 pm. I called customer service and after waiting 30 minutes was greeted by a very rude and condescending woman. I asked her if the flight was going to cancelled or if they will still flying at almost midnight. She was not helpful and told me they'll fly even if it's 3 in the morning or else I'll have to take the next flight in 1 week! I originally paid extra for the very front row seats and they ended up changing and moving me back with no explanation and no price adjustment. At approximately 854pm I was notified that our flight was now leaving at 1000pm. I hopped in my truck and booked it to the airport (25 mins away). I was already checked in and only bringing a carry-on so I ran to my gate. I arrived there at 935 and guess what? The plane wasn't even there yet! I will never book a flight with Allegiant again. They advertise low prices but by the time you pay for seat selection and fees, you pay just as much as other airlines that operate at a professional level.",-1

Could not understand the agent and the process was so complicated. Drove 3 hours to the airport to find the trip canceled and they had no other options. They could not work with other airlines to book me because they have no relationships with any. Complete nightmare. Never use them.,-1

2021-03-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Midway to Asheville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,4,I have never had such an unacceptable experience,True," I have never had such an unacceptable experience. My spouse and I are teachers and wanted to travel on spring break, from Chicago to Asheville. Spring break is only a week long. They cancelled our flight and only offered another one four days later, impossible on spring break of only 7 days. Our vacation, after finally getting vaccinated and teaching remotely for a year, was ruined. They offered a refund, which was nice - I suppose, but we lost our vacation. They wouldn’t rebook us on another airline, and had no other options other than leaving days later. If you want to get somewhere on a specific date and time, avoid this airline. Here I sit - at home, when I should be on a vacation I spent hours planning and paying for.",-1
2021-03-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rockford to Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,Don't bother with this airline,True,"  Don't bother with this airline. Their low rates very quickly go away as soon as you want any bags, to pick a seat, even to get water during your flight. They literally charge for everything. Additionally, I booked a package deal with them and yet was charged by the rental car company and the hotel in addition to the package price I already had paid. Additionally, it is obvious they don't clean their planes between flights. That's bad enough in a normal environment. But completely inexcusable as we deal with COVID. They should be ashamed of themselves. And no one should ever fly this airline. Additionally, no one responds to e-mails or online chats or picks up the customer service phone.",-1
2021-03-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Grand Rapids,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1,plane was not disinfected or sanitary,False,"  The plane was not disinfected or sanitary like promised. My seat was filthy and they did nothing about it. I arrive at the airport early it was closed. I waited outside for it to open no big deal. We board the plane and about 20 minutes later start running into delays normal. We had to deplane so they could fix an issue. After about an hour of waiting for answers the intercom goes off “stop asking us questions it’s not our fault your flight is delayed if you want answers ask the flight attendants and pilots” of course they were sitting in plane when this announcement went off. About 30 minutes later they told us we will have an update in about an hour telling the status if the plane. That update didn’t come for a hour and a half. My flight was suppose to leave at 5pm now it is 9pm and they tell us our flight is cancelled and to not talk to them until after we have received our bags. We wait an HOUR to receive or bags from baggage claim by threat time the airport was closed and they didn’t have any answers for us on why the flight was canceled. Left many people stranded because there was no Uber’s or lyfts just the airport shuffle that took you to a $200 hotel a night. They didn’t even offer or give out any vouchers or discounts. I heard them tell multiple people that this is a typical thing Allegiant Air does and I even asked myself. Okay fast forward 24hours I’m back at the airport only to board a disgusting plane. It had gum in my tray and filthy area. It’s surprising because it’s COVID 19 and you didn’t disinfect or sanatize the seats before allowing people to board the plane. And getting a hold of customer service is a 5 day task they are terrible. I highly recommend flying with anyone but Allegiant, that was my first and definitely my last time. Allegiant just wants your money they don’t follow protocols.",-1

My bags were on the plane and I arrived at 6.40, 20 minutes before the plane was scheduled to depart at 7. A girl boarded 30 seconds before I got there. The staff were extremely unkind to me, he told me I was not able to board even though I made the flight by 20 minutes. My family was on the flight already and told them I was running late. Terrible service. My bags were on the plane, it departed with my bags still on. No refunds or apologies by anyone. I would not recommend this airline.",-1

I called 3 times, first woman hung up on me, trying to act like she couldn’t hear me when she clearly shuddered twice when I spoke to her while she “couldn’t hear me”, then hung up. Second call was a supervisor, she was extremely unprofessional and hung up on me as well when I told her I was going to write a review. Then last I had a call with a staff member who was patient and tried his best to provide me information to create a claim. This flight will take your luggage and still leave without you before the flight is scheduled to take off. Very inconsiderate of their customers. They left me with no clothing and the next flight was 5 days away, they did nothing to accommodate this inconvenience. Very poor service. Literally makes me sick to my stomach since I’ve been a regular customer for years.",-1

The best part was our flight attendant. He was entertaining and hilarious from the start of the flight to the very end.

Worst Airline possible. Yes, flights are cheap, but you get what you pay for, horrible.",-1
2021-02-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Flint to St Petersburg,2.0,,1.0,,,3.0,3,Worst flight ever!,False,"  Worst flight ever!! I have had my seat choice, 3D, reserved for several months. Why is it when I board the plane, a. There is someone in my seat, b. I am the one that has to move and c. I’m put next to a screaming baby? The 2 front cabin flight attendants were less than helpful in trying to locate a better seat on the plane for me and there were seats available. It will be a very long time, if ever, I fly Allegiant again. And would not recommend to anyone.",-1
2021-02-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Reno,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,This company is pretty terrible,True,  Probably the worst customer service we have experienced with an airline. We asked them to print us tickets since our online check in boarding passes werent working at TSA. They proceeded to try to get us to download an app etc. Said they could not print us tickets and we ended up not making the flight since the tickets they were pulling up werent working at TSA. We went to TSA 3 times with tickets they had pulled up. Talked with customer service at baggage claim later who said they can print tickets for $5. Again the ticket counter never offered this even though we asked for our printed tickets. This company is pretty terrible.,-1
2021-02-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Asheville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I wish I had realized how bad they were before booking,True," I will never fly Allegiant again. Be warned, this airline does not care if it inconveniences you or if you actually need to arrive at a destination at a certain day and time. They are perfectly comfortable listing multiple flights and then cancelling and merging flights to maximize their bottom line at the expense of your experience. I wish I had realized how bad they were before booking, so I am warning you. I thought it was just the reality of value air travel so you have zero perks. I didn’t realize they were this unprofessional so as to cancel with no compensation or care. Cancelled my return flight a week out, rescheduled to an earlier time that removed one day of our 3 day vacation. Then they cancelled my departure flight at 1am the night before departure, only option was way late in the day so I lost the first day as well, then they delayed it again (ultimately 8 hours later than original departure time). Beware! If you have any other option, book with any other airline. Not worth any savings you may think you get. I wish I could give a zero or a negative number for this review. The fact I have to give at least a 1 feels generous.",-1
2021-02-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Maria to Mesa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,The worst customer service ever,False,"  We all know that Allegiant is an economy airline. And that they charge for absolutely everything that you want, including water. I had prepaid for a carry on. When I went to get my boarding pass, they charged me $5 to print it. They saw my carry on and didn't say anything. Went through security and got ready to board. It was 2"" too thick. It would have easily fit in an overhead compartment. They said I needed to pay for it to be checked. $50. I asked for a credit for what I had already paid for the carry on and I would pay the difference. She was completely rude and said Allegiant never refunds or credits. Allegiant just started flights out of Santa Maria. The plane is not even half full. With this attitude I doubt they will be here long. The worst customer service ever. Flyer be aware.",-1
2021-02-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to Tampa,3.0,2.0,4.0,,,3.0,1,Fly with caution!,True,"  Absolutely horrible business practices! The trip started with an understandable weather delay which developed into a 36 he mechanical delay because the plane was not properly maintained during the storm. Allegiant refused to recognize it as mechanical issue instead of weather despite the fact that other airlines were flying in and out in those conditions. This delay cost me an overnight stay waiting for the flight to either be fixed or a rescue plane sent. Additional cost for food as there was only one venue available and we were told to stay near the gate. I also lost money on my destination lodging which was no longer refundable or able to cancel because delays took so long. when I contacted Allegiant customer service about the issue they absolutely refused to acknowledge any wrongdoing and stated that they were not required by law to provide any kind of compensation. I recognize that there is no legal obligation but there is an obligation for the business to act in good faith towards its customers. All told, I paid $270 for the flight and an additional $250 in food and lodging expense as a result of the delay. The company refuses to do right by the situation. This is not my first go round with delays and cancellations with this company but it will be my last. Fly with caution!",-1
2021-02-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Columbus,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1, asked about some possible and future charges,False,"  I was flying with this fly airline company due another passenger gave me this fly ticket as a gift. Before leaving from my home, I decided to call Allegiant Air's customer service, making some consult, specifically, about the laptop fly classification. Due the cheapest value of this kind of ticket, I asked about some possible and future charges at customer service. The answer was the computer doesn't have any charge at the airport front desk. Believing the information I received; I decided to use my most and loved let her and personalized computer suitcase and carry my computer in. Into the airplane, ready and waiting for departing, I saw a lady who was carrying, not only a hand suitcase, a computer suitcase plus a back bag. I was curious and I decided to ask how much she paid, not by the laptop (50,00 US$) but by the backbag. She answered me nothing.",1

For the same carry on bags they didn’t made us pay in Miami, they forced us to pay for them in Memphis or they wouldn’t left us go into the flight! We call to customer service and they just say they don’t trust us and that their people are always right. No words for that, just never flying with them again. A",-1

2021-01-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"New Orleans, Louisiana to Concord, North Carolina",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely unacceptable,True," Flying to New Orleans was fine. An hour before boarding in New Orleans to go back home the flight was cancelled. The customer service agent at the airport explained how much he hated this airline and that the next flight was in February and there’s nothing he could do. I’m an officer in the military and had to be home Monday AM so my only option was to rent a car and drive the 11 hours to NC. When I finally made it home close to midnight the airport had no attendants on site to receive the car so I then had to drive the car back home - in the city where I don't have additional parking available for a second vehicle. I parked the car on the street and of course, got a parking ticket for being 8 minutes late to move the car. Then today I got to drop off the rental and pay for an Uber to get back to my home. The cost of renting a car, gas, parking ticket and Uber of course isn’t covered by the company who stranded me in New Orleans. Absolutely unacceptable, I will never use this company again.",-1

We boarded the plane and 1 hour later they tell us there's a 2 hour delay. We get back on the plane, they say its all good. 12.15 was the leave time. Still in Indianapolis at 4pm. This company need financial aid, this company need to learn how to take care of their planes and not hiring elementary graduates. The crew were laughing and eating together. Never asked us for a complimentary drink while waiting. Worst plane service out there. They don't deserve help.",-1

2020-12-21,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Des Moines to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Save yourself the headaches,False,"  Save yourself the headaches. Fly with anyone else. Yes this year has been crazy, but companies like this sure don't help. I was supposed to travel for work to Vegas to go to a week long professional conference. Of course had to pay out of pocket and would get reimbursed. However, here comes COVID....and of course Allegiant only offers a voucher. A voucher that says travel must be completed by February. What good does that do? Half the states they fly to from here are so locked down there is no point to even go. Been trying to get a hold of Allegiant to see if that can be extended due to the continued pandemic....not looking good. Basically out $500 because of the pandemic. Judging by the reviews, this isn't a new practice. Surprised by the number of people with 1 star reviews their business practices haven't resulted in a class action suit yet.",-1

I will never fly this airline again, I thought I was saving some money, in the end turned out to be more expensive that any other airline. I strongly recommend you find another airline to give your money to.",-1

Just walking into the door of the airport we were greeted by staff member Pat. He was out of his way helpful and kind. All the staff members were as nice as they could be. I wish, I could remember all of their names to give them the credit they so well deserve. I put my son on the plane with full confidence he will be taking good care of. I will always fly Allegiant Air. Thank you again for treating us like family.",1
2020-11-17,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Las Vegas,1.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,I am extremely disappointed,True,"  My flight was scheduled to leave Cincinnati at 6:30 am as I was getting in my car with my 2 adult children to leave for the airport i got a notice that my flight was delayed by 10 hours. 10 hours? Seriously? We lost an entire day of our vacation. We had a RV reserved that had to be picked up by 4:00. With the flight arriving later than that we were unable to pick it up. Unfortunately not only did we still have to pay for that day, but I had to scramble to find a place to stay for the night in Vegas AND pay for that too. We had planned our trip According to the weather forecast as well and due to this delay we ended up in snowstorms and really unable to enjoy the things we went to see. Had we had that extra day we would have been a day ahead of the weather. I am extremely disappointed in the communication received by your airline and completely disappointed that we had to spend in excess of an extra 300.00 that I was not expecting to spend. I understand short delays but we literally lost an entire day, an excessive amount of money and lots of good weather. I do want to acknowledge however that the 2 male flight attendants were simply amazing and recognize them for their good work. I sent this to Allegiant and was told that there would be zero compensation. I was quoted an FAA quote that says that they don't have to do anything. My response, just because you don't have to doesn't mean you shouldn't. I will never fly Allegiant again. No explanation No apologies No nothing. The flight attendants on the way home were horrible too. The only good thing about this flight was the flight attendants on the way there",-1
2020-11-16,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Provo,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3,not a brand I’m willing to support,False,"  I’ve flown through both of these airports several times with no issues. Their prices aren’t much different from Southwest but the Mesa airport is closer to my destination. On this flight they randomly decided the carry-on bag that I’ve used every time was too big and had to be charged for. I watched this lady allow several people with the same size bags go on without any issue. Why she targeted me? I don’t know, maybe Allegiant has employees that are comfortable discriminating. I think this is a major ethical red flag and not a brand I’m willing to support.",-1

The next available flight out of the airport was 2 weeks away. The cost me $250 to extend my car rental and drive to another state to catch a flight home. They refused to compensate me, even with a voucher, for these additional costs and inconveniences. I will never fly them again and strongly suggest against doing so yourself.",-1

Yet, passengers were allowed move around freely in the cabin without a mask. One of the flight attendants wore a mask but did not cover her nose. There was no attempt made by the employees of Allegiant to enforce the mask mandate.",-1
2020-10-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rickenbacker to Savannah,,,,,,,1,I wouldn’t recommend Allegiant Air,True,"  Never got to go on this flight as it delayed so many times over the course of two full days. Was scheduled to take off at 9:19 am on October 1 and didn’t depart until almost 6pm on October 2. When we received a delay announcement on day two after the long day sitting at the airport and waiting, paying for hotels and loosing our rental car, condo reservations and boat passes at our Destination, we opted to contact Allegiant via phone and with no explanation other than maintenance, they refunded our money. The disregard of the staff for what they had put us through was the reason for this review. There was no compensation for our troubles other than the refund which we were grateful for. But we all spent 2 days in Columbus for no reason whatsoever! I wouldn’t recommend Allegiant Air to anyone that needs to actually get somewhere.",-1

Around me are passengers who are not wearing their masks correctly ... under their nose, on their chin. The steward when told, clearly, could not care less. As we boarded, one stewardess stood in the front, greeting the oncoming passengers slowly sipping a drink. I guess as they say, you get what you pay for - but the blatant disregard for the health of the passengers, who do care, it is appalling.",-1

2020-09-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Santa Maria,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not a proponent of masks,True,"  Allegiant air refused me boarding. I was waiting in the boarding area when an agent told me I must cover my nose. At this point I was over 10 feet away and no one within 10 feet or more. In 5 or so minutes he came back by and told me to cover my nose. At this point I moved out of sight and sat down with my back to them. Around me were 9 to 10 people who were not covering noses, just in the area I was in. When time for boarding came the agent would not let me board. I did have the mask on and nose covered because I was in social distance of people. I asked for a supervisor and she would not let me on based on the agents testimony. This supervisor was intent on not letting me board. I asked to talk to her supervisor. After a brief conversation with her supervisor she said I could board. I had to promise to keep the mask on. I was the last person on the plane. When on the plane I was upgraded to the front of the plane so they could watch me.  My cabin mates across from me were not obeying and had there masks below their noses. Numerous times the stewards would pass and not say anything to them about there masks. I hope that Allegiant air will give some sensitivity training to their employees in this pandemic time.  I am definitely not a proponent of masks for all situations. There are times like on a plane where I believe they might do something, but come on man, when your 10 feet or so away let's get real. Science hasn't convinced me totally on how a masked society at large could save the world. I was constantly monitored on the plane about my mask when right next to me were 2 people that obviously were allowed to wear there masks below their nose without any mention.",-1
2020-08-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Memphis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never book this airline again,True,  I got to the front desk to check in my bags to receive my military discount am hour and a half before my flight. No one ever came to the counter. Me and 8 other people missed the flight because of needed to check a bag. Sat on the customer service line for over a hour trying to get assistance. One a representative came to the line he then proceeded to tell me per his records he show I am the only person that missed the flight. I then asked him to repeat his self for the other people standing here who also missed boarding the same flight. Then and only then did a manager come to the phone and tell me the best she can do is book me for the next flight which is 3 days away at the price $75. So not only did they cause me to miss my flight but also charged me for another one. The staff was so unprofessional and didn’t care. Everyone had to purchase new flights. I will never book this airline again.,-1

Flights get delayed, canceled, whatever. If thats the case, however, then accomodations must be made. I did my part by arriving early and prepared to board. Im paying to get from point a to point b at certain times. Its not my fault for the delay. So now Im here, stuck at an airport where i was just told we will have to leave because its closing. I'm losing a day or more (since they have no idea when the next flight will be)of work, i have a brother who will miss this flight and another since he is going to another destination. My 2 year old diaebetic daughter has no place to stay and i have no means of getting them to another location. The best the staff could offer? That I, me, not them, call customer relations. Do the right thing. If you cant hold to your end of the bargain, then you must make things right. What a joke.",-1

This is the 2nd time I have tried to use them with a rental car option. Last time they claimed I did not have a car rental reserved despite my conf number. This time they bumped our flight from arriving at 8 pm to 10:30 pm We arrived with all car rental booths closed! Entire family waited until midnight for a taxi that cost $127 to get to our condo. I called Allegiant and was told I could go back to the airport at 8 am the next day- another $127 to get my rental. No reimbursement for the taxi, no apologies. Simply told me I should have checked Alamo hours! Really?",-1

They are always pleasant in flight also. Glad to see direct flights from Fort Wayne! We rented a car with our airfare this time when they sent out a coupon for us to use. I do not recommend that at all! Ended up paying another $335 in fees at the rental center. Had I known I would have just rented on my own like we usually do and saved a few hundred dollars.,1

We we’re told we could file a claim and be reimbursed for items lost and items we had to purchase while there. We filed a claim with receipts as proof two things in our suitcase and purchased things needed while there for almost $1900 we get an email today from the baggage claim saying they’re offering us $287 this is despicable. I will never step foot on a allegiant flight again. Why submit all these things with proof of cost if they aren’t going to even come close to giving you the money you spent and lost from them losing your baggage.,-1

Until today I have not had a problem. After booking my flight my flight time was changed 3 times. The last change would have gotten me into Sanford at 10:00 pm then I have a 2.5 hour ride home and have to be to work at 5am. The big problem is that it is very obvious that the crew with this airline couldn’t possibly care less. They will do whatever they want and don’t care how it effects their passengers.,-1

Considering that I’m an exceptionally tall person, my girlfriend immediately took advantage of the opportunity and got us seats in the front row. Our seats were confirmed at the gate but upon boarding the plane, we were informed that their policy is to keep the front rows empty. As I write this, my knees are in the seat back in front of me and will not be flying with this airline again.",-1
2020-07-04,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Destin,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,2,the worst airline ever,False, By far the worst airline ever. My flight got delayed twice. There departure times are never accurate. The staff working on the plane were not paying attention on their jobs and instead on there phones.  I’ve been waiting at my gate since 2:30 in the afternoon expecting to leave at 4:30 but had to wait another hour or so to leave at 6:10-15.,-1
2020-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rockford to Sanford,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,won't be flying with them again,True,"  They did not do much to prevent Covid or practice social distancing. They didn't sanitize after the fight before us got off, we lined up and got right on after. They handed out masks but it was optional to wear them. They also condensed fights and every seat was full.

I returned my rental car to enterprise and they didn’t have the phone number for Allegiant even though they are in the same building. An enterprise agent did wheelchair me to the check in counter. Then they sat me in the wheelchair waiting for someone to come. After 15 minutes I used the ladies room. Again waited...I felt that I needed to struggle walking to the gate as no one showed up and I didn’t want to miss my flight. Two couples without masks were allowed on the plane and the plane was full with no social distancing. From Florida to Allentown everyone had an empty seat next to them. Not on the way! Have they forgotten how deadly the virus is? So within a month we went from being responsible and trying to keep distance between people and now it’s as though the covid-19 is a non issue.,1
2020-06-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Niagara Falls,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,people not wearing a mask,True,  I am an emergency room physician. My wife and i are both over 60. Shame on Allegiant for risking my life and those of the other 100 or so people on that plane by not following basic protocols for social distancing. We arrive at the airport and loading instead of being done in a organized fashion maintaining the 6 feet spacing is business as usual as people are standing on top of each other in the aisles. After landing in Niagara Falls it was really bad as no attempt to keep people seated to offload appropriately was even tried. In addition people are on the place not wearing a mask. Middle seats were not left open. It was business as usual.,-1
2020-05-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Pasco,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1,concerned about the crowded conditions,False,"  We provided this complaint into the Airline’s email complaint system, then posted letters to the CEO of Allegiant and the Washington State Department of Health. We then submitted an official complaint to the FAA. Three days later, we have yet to receive a response. So much for government accountability! Allegiant Flight 582 on May 24, 2020 from Mesa, AZ to Pasco, WA Regarding the subject flight, we were very concerned about the crowded conditions on the subject plane. Most rows had every seat taken. In our row the middle seat was taken by an individual who was not a family member and not wearing a mask.  My wife, Marjorie and I are also a member of a vulnerable group, age 70 and above. There was never any opportunity given to us to request to be seated in a row that complied with social distance guidelines. We wore masks and gloves for the entire flight, but wonder if these measures were sufficient given the crowded conditions in your plane. I might remind you that New York subways had high death rates when train were crowded with passengers. There were a number of children who were crying almost the entire flight. The flight attendant did give a bottle of water to one of the infants, and that seem to calm that child down. What other measures might have been taken like giving some candy? Upon boarding your plane, we were given a package containing a mask, gloves and Sani wipes but there was no requirement to use them. We noted that the next flight announced boarding before we even reached the luggage area. I conclude that the plane could not have been completely cleaned by the airline personnel! Thinking back on our flight, boarding was started 10 or 15-minutes after the last passenger debarked! I conclude that both flights (and most likely all flights made by that plane on that day) could not have been properly cleaned. Was it your plan to leave up to passengers to clean their own areas? If so, this deficiency should have been announced to all passengers. We were not traveling for pleasure, instead travel for us was essential as we were attending the funeral of my father who died at an age of 95.",-1
2020-05-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Rochester,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,attendants did not wear masks,False,"  Extremely disappointed with Allegiant Air. Before booking air travel for an elderly family member we were assured of the safety measures that they were taking to prevent the spread of Covid 19. We were told that seats were being assigned to insure social distancing of passengers (ie. Not assigning the middle seat) and that all passengers would receive a safety pouch with mask, gloves and sanitizing wipes. Our family member was seated in a FULL row with a very full plane. No safety pouches were ever distributed (masks only were offered -not required). Once in the air they proceeded to have drink service and attendants did not wear masks! The passenger right next to our family member ordered 2 drinks. Of course consuming them without a mask. Does this sound like a safe flight to you? Very upset and concerned for our family member. Please be aware air travel not as safe as the airline might make it sound.",-1

2020-04-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Arizona to Montana,,,,,,,1,a horrible business to support,True,"  Given our current covid-19 pandemic I called the airline in order to get a refund instead of a credit due to the fact that my family is high risk and we will not be taking a flight anymore. Once this pandemic cleared up we would plan to drive instead and have no need for the airline ticket. When I called the lady I spoke to was not only incredibly rude even though I was very polite and professional, she also threatened me after issuing the refund by saying that they have documented in my account that they will never waive any type of fees for us. Talk about incredibly rude and a horrible business to support. They need to be more understanding and respectful of the fact that we are in a pandemic. I will never support this business again!",-1
2020-03-28,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Peoria to Punta Gorda,,,,,,,4,helped make the changes quickly,False,  Peoria to Punta Gorda. Just wanted to say kudos to the young lady who helped with my flight change. Due to the virus outbreak wife and I had to push our Florida trip out a few months. The young lady was a delightful person who helped make the changes quickly. She was also considerate enough to inquire how we were doing during our stay at home situation. I didn't get her name but you need more like her.,1

Long story, short, their trip was cancelled, so needed to get back home. Could not get through on phone line, the website was overwhelmed. Went directly to the airport to try and exchange the return trip ticket for that day. It was all hands on deck, some people had worked 12-hour shifts, still, the staff was amazing, tried to make whatever it took to accommodate passengers request. They all looked a bit frazzled. In a situation like this, that no one has experienced, you just can’t fix stupid and some people are just jerks.",1

I have been trying to call Allegiant to cancel my flight due to the Coronavirus and phone lines are busy all day, I have been trying for 5 hours now! The web site states you can cancel on line with no Penalty, and either a refund or Voucher will be issued. It showed me how much I was getting refunded and it’s less than what I paid for the tickets for me and my son and this is only on my Departing flight, it will not let me cancel my returning flights! It gives you a non working number to call! So if I can not get through to anyone, the main number is busy or off the hook and the number they give you is a non working number how are our flights going to get canceled and how our we getting refunded the amount we paid for our tickets.",-1

I have been calling customer service since Friday and the line has been busy. I had to cancel my flight due to the Coronavirus situation that’s going on and I don’t think that it’s fair to only be given a voucher for $167 when I paid $381. This was going to be my 1st time and last time flying. If I can’t be refunded all of my money I wanted to see if our tickets could be reinstated but no one is responding to my emails and I can’t get through on the phone lines. I need help with this issue asap.,-1

I had heard the wait was long so I prepared for such a wait at this trying time for all. My wait was a little over 2 hrs. I was happy to get a wonderful gal in the other end who was thoughtful and took time to make sure all of our questions were answered regarding getting our refund and how to use in the future. She waited until the emails came in and made sure we got or vouchers. It made the expected wait time all worth it.",1
2020-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Springfield,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,least military friendly airline,True,"  Los Angeles to Springfield. Allegiant has to be the least military friendly airline operating in the US. First they change their baggage policy to require active duty to be flying with dependents, without notifying customers, which makes no sense. Especially in light of the fact that our spouses can't fly right now due to DOD orders. Then, when active military can't fly due to DOD order, they want to charge a cancellation fee online (even though they say they don't) OR you can call a number that is always busy. We have several reservations to fly with them, and considering we either have to fly now/later or get a voucher, we have no option for full refunds and are forced to complete travel or lose money. Ticket prices with Allegiant ARE NOT cost effective when you have to check multiple bags, as many military families do due to living so far away from home. We will never book another flight with Allegiant again.",-1
2020-03-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,make changes without penalty,False,  Trying to change my son's flight due to the Corona virus!! What a nightmare. Started the process 2 days ago. They said you could make changes without penalty. I tried doing that through the website but it would not let me. The number busy for days. I drove to the airport an hour away to be turned away. Currently been on hold for 2 hours starting at 12.45 am. Ridiculous. Never again will I use this airline!,-1
2020-03-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to South bend,,,,,,1.0,1,never fly with Allegiant again,False,"  Phoenix to South bend. Allegiant Air has the worst customer service of any airline I have ever experienced. Despite efforts of emailing, calling and Facebook messages multiple times over the last week, we could not reach one airline employee. Finally, we decided to go to the airport in hopes of a flight change. Despite an email from Allegiant on the 8th stating that flights could be changed due to the pandemic, they would not stand behind their offer to change our flight. Around $400 was lost on the flight. I will never fly with Allegiant again nor suggest them to anyone.",-1
2020-03-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Gulfport,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,Her luggage was lost,True,"  Nashville to Gulfport. My sister and I fly together. We checked our luggage at the same time at the Allegiant air ticket counter. When we arrived in Gulfport, only my luggage appeared on the conveyor. Her luggage was lost. It took about 27 phone calls and several emails before being able to reach customer service. I spoke with Two customer service representatives. The first one was Carol. She was rude, degrading and hateful. And then I was conveniently disconnected. When I finally reached a second representative, Orlando, he was also unconcerned. Final results of spending my very first day, without luggage, on my vacation, was that my luggage would be shipped to the resort but Boone was able to tell me when it would arrive. I was also told that I needed to keep receipts of anything that I purchased, within reason. And I asked if I would be reimbursed, her response was, “why else would I ask you to keep your receipts”. The second person, Orlando told me not to purchase any namebrand items or they would not reimburse me for those things. There was no compassion that my vacation was ruined. There was only 39 people on the airplane. Two people did not receive their luggage.",-1
2020-03-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bismarck to Las Vegas,1.0,,5.0,,,2.0,2,more reliable airlines out there,True,  Bismarck to Las Vegas return. The flight itself was good. But we had about a 1.5 hour delay before we left and over a 2 hour delay leaving which messed up a lot of our plans. Customer service after our 2 hour delay was horrible! Think twice about using Allegiant! Their are plenty other more reliable airlines out there!,-1
2020-03-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Indianapolis,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,There was no refund,True,"  Punta Gorda to Indianapolis. I have always flown Allegiant and I fly quite often. With this Coronavirus scare, and reading that there will be no penalty for canceling a flight, I tried emailing, calling and Facebook messenger to connect with someone. No response and via phone for the past few days all it says is all lines are busy. Are they deliberately doing this so no cancellation can be made during this time? I finally cancelled my return trip via the app. There was no refund. Now I’m stuck. I will never fly Allegiant again! I will pay more for a flight and fly an airline with better customer service!",-1
2020-03-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Boise,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,such an unethical company,True,"  Allegiant is such an unethical company. We had a flight from LA to Boise. They cancelled our flight and told us they would refund our money or let us take another flight 4 days later. The amount they offered did not come close to covering the costs of the cancellation between food, hotel, transportation, etc. Even more atrocious is their customer service. I tried calling customer service to find out what to do and literally waited for OVER 3 hours without anyone every picking up. I then drove to the airport at 7:00 in the evening and there was not a single Allegiant representative at Los Angeles Airport. I tried to chat online but they were kept giving me an all agents are busy. I wasn't able to get ahold of anyone until after I got home and they were very rude and unapologetic. Their excuse is they are busy.",-1
2020-03-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to St Petersburg,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,not accommodating at all,False,  Cedar Rapids to St Petersburg . Asked to get a credit on flight dates and times due to the outbreak of the corona virus. Allegiant was not accommodating at all. Charged you 99.00 per person and the difference between the price of tickets now and future prices. We purchased tickets for 200.00 for existing trip and would have had to pay 400.00 per ticket to change our dates. Every other airline has been making accommodations for flights and offering vouchers. Not Allegiant! I hold their MasterCard and use their airlines often. We will be finding other airports to fly out of and will discontinue with their MasterCard. It’s very unfortunate when not everyone is on board with unforeseen events.,-1
2020-03-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Allentown to Sanford,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,single worst flight experience,False," Allentown to Sanford. Not one part of this experience was enjoyable. They boarded us an hour and a half before our flight took off, as soon as everyone was ready to depart they said we would be on the runway for an hour and 10 minutes. As soon as we landed there were more problems and we remained on the runway for over 40 minutes as no stairs were attached for us to depart. The single worst flight experience my family has ever had.",-1
2020-03-04,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Asheville,2.0,,4.0,,,2.0,2,learn to train their staff,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Asheville . The lack of a ""Take Charge"" person at the ticket counter in Fort Lauderdale was extremely disconcerting. Over 200 people were in line and there was NOT one person that had the backbone nor (obviously) the authority to actually make an announcement about a cancelled flight. The fact that most of the travelers had more common sense and understood the situation better than the Allegiant staff is very telling about the direction this company is heading. The staff did not know the reason for the flight to Knoxville being cancelled to the following day. They had no manager on staff. The staff was kind, however, when you have 200 people that are being told they have to find a place to stay for the night, the kindness wore off very quickly. Each passenger was given an $8 food voucher .. what a joke! All the restaurants are on the other side of security. You cannot get through security without a valid boarding pass! No one was offered accommodations for the night. It became intense rather quickly. The staff were not trained and were ill prepared to deal with the scenario unfolding in front of them. There was noi management to handle the situation. I am seriously questioning whether I want to fly with this airline again. Corporate needs to learn to train their staff to communicate in an effective manner to disgruntled customers.",-1
2020-03-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Ft. Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,delay the flight one hour at a time,False,"  Louisville to Ft. Lauderdale. I fly this airline multiple times a year, and you get what you pay for. They will delay the flight one hour at a time until you have been wait for 5 hours. This has happened more times than I can count in the last few years. And good luck trying to get a hold of someone on the customer service line. I honestly wonder if anybody even works there or it's just a answering machine. I will never understand why they wont just tell people the flight is delayed until the last minute. I don't mind to wait I just don't want to sit at the airport for hours. And many people I have spoken with feel the same way.",-1
2020-02-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St Pete/Tampa to Indianapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst airline experience,True,  St Pete/Tampa to Indianapolis. Worst airline experience ever. We were delayed 6 hours first due to a runway problem but then followed by a series of very poor decisions by Allegiant. Avoid this company at all cost. The small price savings is not worth the high level of stress and delays that are regularly happening with this company.,-1
2020-02-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Concord to Sanford,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,terrible customer service,True,"  Concord to Sanford. Our flight was originally delayed by 15 minutes. As the delay stretched longer and longer, no one could officially tell us what was going on or how long we would wait, only that they would not give any refunds but that we could transfer flights to another day without penalty. However in order to even do that, we would have to leave to go to the ticketing office, which was outside the TSA security checkpoint. TSA had left by then (with stancheons up that prevented anyone from leaving), so our fear was that of we left, and didn't get rebooked, we couldn't come back and wait for our current flight since there was no security left. We waited for over 2 hours with no information. Eventually we were told that we would be leaving FOUR hours late. We eventually did, but after asking what would happen since we would arrive in Sanford five hours before the rental car agency counter opened (or three hours after it closed), we were told that we would just have to wait or ask them when we got there. When we got there there were no employees of Allegiant there to ask so we asked the Allegiant luggage check in supervisor, who was working with departing flights and she said she was just contracted through Allegiant (though she had an Allegiant shirt on and was working at an Allegiant counter) and that I had to contact Allegiant customer care...which was closed then since it was 4 am. She also said we would have to wait for five more hours for our rental car and there was nothing she could do even though we booked the car through Allegiant. At least the rental car agency was open and had good customer service (unlike Allegiant) and we didn't have to camp out for five additional hours. We heard no updates until we has already been sitting there for hours. And even when we had an update, we were never, to this day, provided with an explanation. Terrible, terrible customer service. We were there with a friend who was waiting for over 6 hours for her flight to St. Petersburg FL. This is not a stand-alone incident.",-1

It had pretty good reviews but had been notified of delays before. I went ahead and booked with them. This is the first time and definitely the last time!!! A delay on a bright morning? In the afternoon? I should have just went to Sacramento international airport. I don’t recommend this airline at least in small cities!,-1
2020-02-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Concord to St Pete,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,They know absolutely nothing,True,"  This was to be my first flight on this airline. I fly often and was reluctant but thought I would give it a try. I booked a Thurs 2/20 trip from Concord to St Pete, FL. It was snowing that night so they had a delay to de ice the plane. The guy in the de icer truck ran into the plane. We had to return to the terminal. They have no mechanics at the airport so it took 1.5 hrs for one to arrive to inspect the damage. What were our options we wanted to know. How long would it take to inspect? Would they have another plane come and get us? Was there another flight the next day? They said ""we have nothing to tell you, we are waiting on corporate but if you leave the terminal you forfeit your ticket"". After 2 hrs they said there was another flight next day but there was only 28 spots available. The ticket counter was outside of security. There was a huge line. Did they provide food and drinks? No. However they lied to the local TV channel and said they did provide as well as give meal vouchers. At 9pm they announced last call at the concession. At 10pm they closed the TSA security checkpoint so if you went out to change your flight and waited in line for 2hrs you couldnt get back into the terminal. I gave up and left the terminal and went home at 10:30 expecting to eat the cost. I did have my wife call customer service to try and get me rebooked for the following night. She got through after a 1:20 minute hold time. They did refund the ticket. I was told the flight arrived in St Pete at 2 AM All the staff at the customer service, gate people, and guys working on the runway are all kids, 18-22 area. They know absolutely nothing and really dont care. Remember, if you fly this airline there are only 2 flight a week per route so if it gets cancelled you are stuck",-1

I have flown Allegiant on several different occasions and more times than not the fights are delayed. The current flight I’m waiting on now has changed from 8:30 PM now to depart at 11 PM. One would think I would learn by now that there is a reason this airline has flights for so cheap. The service is mediocre at best, the flights are ok when you finally get to get on them, and the baggage charges are high. I think it’s about time I upgrade to a better airline.",-1

I am growing more and more disappointed and frustrated with this airline after each flight. The lack of timeliness has gone from bad to worse! To think it’s not that cheaply priced when you add all the extras up. I used to recommend this airline with hopes it would be a good experience and not represent the horrible experiences it has created for myself and my family thus far. Customer service is at the bottom of their priorities which is even sadder because that should be done well and free in a client service industry.,-1

My flight today was set for 9:27 departure. Delayed. They said it was weather, but I fly small planes and it could have landed just like the plane that came in a few minutes later. Rerouted to Orlando. It's now 11:30, the plane was only supposed to be gone an hour but 3 hours later. They tell everyone it's still in Orlando. Can you not do better than this. I could have gone to Tampa with delta and could have been there by now. Poor excuse for an airline.",-1
2020-02-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Concord,1.0,1.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,everything like pulling teeth,False," Fort Lauderdale to Concord. This airline is easily the worst of the worst. To get a hold of an actual human being is next to impossible. They make reservations easy (the part they make money) and then everything else is like pulling teeth. This airline, for full clarity, did one good round trip and then this one happened. I thought I found a winner until I had an issue. Then I get no information outside of “your flight has been delayed”. You can’t even speak to a real person because they are so cheap that the ticket agents double as boarding agents. This airline has two planes that leave this airport a day. How on earth they have a mechanical or otherwise delay is beyond me. I can guarantee that the only thing keeps these planes in the air is the FAA because the amount of dollar stretching is ridiculous. I’ve personally seen this airline make people miss cruises, hold people hostage in an airport (because the tiny airport TSA checkpoint closed so you couldn’t leave and come back), and make you wait over an hour on hold to talk to an actual person. I tried to allow them to reimburse me for my day lost on my trip but the fact that each and every time they screw something up to me is unacceptable. I hope this company gets the exposure they deserve - that they are run by people who care more about profits than passengers. The flight crew has been nice so it’s clearly not the ground staff. This is a corporate issue. If the people that owned this airline had to fly this way I guarantee someone would be fired. Spend the extra hundred or two dollars and fly an airline that knows how to communicate and fly on time.",-1

There was nothing comparable available! Do not book your hotel thru Allegiant, there is no recourse from the hotel to help with rebooking! Also be aware that Allegiant only offers a flight on selected days, so if there is a problem, you are out of luck. Thank God we didn’t have children who would have been so upset. Don’t plan an important vacation with Allegiant unless you have a lot of flexibility.",-1

Flight G41759 February 7. Approached counter and requested boarding pass because one could not be obtained from kiwi.com. The counter woman told me that I would have to pay for my boarding pass. I ask her why I would pay for a boarding pass. She printed the ticket and in a condescending voice stated ""Well since you're a beginner traveler (truth: I'll be 62 in a few days and am a retired attorney and research librarian and have traveled by air for 50 years without incident) you won't have to pay the $5.00"" I failed to reply, took the ticket and walked on.",1

I absolutely hate flying and am very picky about the airline, but my husband and I took a short flight from Provo, UT to Mesa, AZ on Allegiant and the experience was great. Planes were on time, no issues whatsoever, flight attendants were very kind, and they have such nice perks for military and dependents. Everything was better than expected. Thank you!",1

Was charged $50 each way for a small carry on. One attendant would say it’s ok, another says no I have to pay $50. and they were rude - horrible service. They should just say no carry on whatsoever. Do the math and tack $100 to your flight ticket and see if it’s better to use Southwest or another airline. We were crammed in small seats with tickets costing more than SW. This was my worst travel.",-1

There was no issue with the weather at all which was confirmed by our weather regulator. I will never fly Allegiant again",-1

This has been the worst experience of my life with so many delays. I’m trying to get some where I don’t want to sit and have to wait. Delayed on the way down and delayed on the way back.

We came to the airport thinking our flight was to be at 3:17 and after we checked in and looked at our Boarding Passes, we noticed they had switched the flight and wasn’t leaving until 6:17. Having the flu, staying an additional 4 hrs was not desirable for obvious reasons. When we inquired they said it was a “corporate decision” due to there only being 10 passengers on the 3:17 flight. Thanks a lot for nothing Allegiant. Also they charge for everything .",-1
2020-01-07,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Punta Gorda,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,provided service above and beyond,False,"  We were running late for a flight from Kansas City and Allegiant provided service above and beyond. Thru TSA I was able to obtain the phone number of the manager. She was at home, not even at work, yet returned my phone call and thru text messaging, helped us get on our flight. I was amazed at the personal service and meeting people in corporate jobs who actually care about their job and actually also cared about me, the consumer. Go Allegiant Air!",1

Terrible experience. 3hr delay on trip to FL, and another delay of 3+hrs on the way back. Nothing was offered to make up for the huge waste of time. Flight itself was comfortable, did not experience much turbulance, landing and takeoff were smooth. Would not recommend this airline if you value your time.",-1
2020-01-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Concord to Punta Gorda,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,unpleasant and embarrassing,True," Concord to Punta Gorda. The flight attendant was extremely rude, creating an unpleasant and embarrassing experience for me during the flight. I have flown with Allegiant plenty of times and have never been super impressed by the staff affiliated with this airline, but this woman was completely disrespectful to me when I went to order my adult beverage and showed her my passport. I am not one to leave negative reviews but that was completely uncalled for when I am paying for my experience and supporting the business. It doesn’t help that I had a long layover with multiple gate changes and delays on the way home from St. Petersburg. I am considering whether to book with this airline any more after this.",-1

Well not so much my 2.5 hr flight turned into over 7 hours. The 3rd party company used to compensate did not cover change in flight. I had to go to a airport 30 miles further then go back to Sanford Fl airport to get my car. I ended up over $100 in the hole and ruined the ends of my holiday vacation. Customer service basically said So! Please don't fly this airline I know I won't.",-1

Then the representative took all my info and credit card and booked the minor the opposite direction of the trip I asked for! I then had to wait another 25 minutes on hold for a supervisor to fix the mistake. By the time I hung up I had been on hold or working to add my passenger for 2 hours and 45 minutes!

My flight with Allegiant Air was much better than I expected. The cabin crew were extremely nice and helpful. Takeoff was smooth and landing was butter, which is unusual for a discount airline. *Cough* Ryanair *Cough*. The seats were usual discount airline seats and food was slightly overpriced. Overall, the value for your money is good for the fact that this is a discount airline.",1
2019-12-28,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Las Vegas,,,,,,,1,Highly disappointed,True,"  
Omaha to Las Vegas booked for February 2020. Highly disappointed. We mistakenly booked our upcoming flight to Las Vegas a day later than the party we are meeting in Vegas in February 2020. To add to this disappointment we will be missing a once in a lifetime experience with our friends. I made attempts to call on 3 occasions with exceptionally long wait times. After 3 frustrating attempts I took to the live chat and independent options only to learn it would cost $324 dollars to change our flights. Frustrated with this information I wanted to hear the facts from a live person. I waited out a 53 minute wait time. The representative was courteous but unable to make the changes at any less expense. This entire process was very disheartening considering there are open seats on the flight we need and it is more than 2 months in advance!",-1
2019-12-26,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ogdensburg to Sanford,4.0,,3.0,,,4.0,4,we got what we paid for,False,"  Ogdensburg to Sanford. This is known as a discount flier, so we got what we paid for. People were good and plane was excellent. People just need to remember that it is not built around full service. Reason I am saying this is that some passengers complained about luggage rates, but it is clear from the start on the site that all those fees are extra and prices are right there for you to see. Liked flying out of Ogdensburg, but out of Sanford not so much as hotel options are not that great",1
2019-12-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Newark,,,,,,1.0,1,I would never fly Allegiant again,True,"  Cincinnati to Newark. I was traveling for Christmas on 23rd Monday to visit my family. My flight was at 7 am. I checked in my luggage at the ticketing center (long lines for luggage Checkin), and there was extremely long line at security check point as well, so ended up reaching the counter at 6:47 am. No one was at the desk. I  hopped on to next counter. The lady there said the door closed 5 mins ahead. I was already at the airport with the luggage checked in, but still they didn’t wait for literally two mins. The lady at the counter was just saying the next flight is on Friday 27th or book another flight with Southwest. I understand I didn’t consider extreme long lines at both ticketing center and as well as security clearance, but I would have very much appreciated if they could consider literally 2 mins. I would never fly Allegiant again.",-1
2019-12-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Asheville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,made no attempt to provide anything,True," Our Allegiant flight from Ft Lauderdale to Asheville was horrendous. We had a 7.30 pm flight on Dec 21st 2019 that was first delayed until 9.00. When 9.00 came, the flight was delayed until 11.05. When 11.05 came it was delayed until 12.00 am. When 12 came, again it was delayed until 1.09. We were told that the plane had finally arrived and we could line up to board. As soon as the flight emptied, it was announced that the flight crew had timed out and the flight wouldn't leave until 5.30 the next morning. They offered a $100 voucher. No updates or explanations were given and through most of this there were no attendants to be found. The airport terminal was freezing and all of the vendor areas were closed. Allegiant made no attempt to provide anything to make folks more comfortable. At this point it is 3.00 am and everyone is shivering. Not sure if the flight will go at 5.30 am as promised",-1
2019-12-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chattanooga to Sanford,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no hotel vouchers would be given,False,"  On Sunday Decmber 15, 2019 was scheduled for departure 9:28 PM from gate 5 at the Chattanooga airport flying to Orlando. We started boarding later than the scheduled time, and after sitting on the plane for a little while, an announcement was made that there was an issue with a filter that the crew was working on resolving. Shortly after, we were asked to deplane, as they were having trouble removing the old filter. Once we had deplaned, an announcement was made that they were working on the issue. They informed us that they were working to get another plane in from Orlando that night. However, if they weren’t able to by midnight, we would have to wait until morning to fly home. They announced that all of us had the option to move to a different flight on a different day, going to a different airport. Another announcement was made by Allegiant staff that they were still working to get a replacement plane and crew in tonight. They informed us that if not, our flight would be move to around 0800 am in the morning, and that we would be provided with hotel vouchers. Shortly after this, a cart with a large number of pizzas was brought in and everyone was offered a slice of pizza. No drinks were offered at this time. I do recall that there were a small number of sodas and an even smaller number of very small bottles of water on the gate desk as we were deplaning. This original number of drinks was not enough for everyone, and no other drinks were offered. This was late at a small airport, so there were no vendors open to offer other drink choices or food. Sometime between 11 pm and 12 am, we were informed that we would not be flying home to Orlando tonight, and that our rescheduled flight would be departing at 0537 am the next morning. We were informed that no hotel vouchers would be given. We were informed that we would have to go back to the pre-security area of the airport because we weren’t allowed to stay post-security through the night. We were also informed that we would all be given $100 in vouchers with Allegiant. Our party included 3 adults and 2 boys ages 3 and 6, and we were in a pre-security area. We were concerned about falling asleep while his children were there. We found an area of floor to try to get some sleep. For the next 2 hours, I attempted to get some sleep, but was unable to due to the airport getting colder and colder, and it being noisy and well lit. I got to the point where I was shivering, so I got up around 2:30 am. I went to the Allegiant check in desk, and found a staff member. He informed me that the manager never showed up, which was expected by the staff. He found my suitcase for me so I could get another sweatshirt and a beanie cap to keep warm. I went back to the room with my friends to try again to get some sleep. After a while I finally dozed off, to be awoken around 0400 am. We immediately went up to security, and went through, back to gate 5 to await our flight. $100 in vouchers, that we were given each, was just kicking us while we were down. I slept less than an hour prior to getting on that flight that morning. $100 in flight vouchers isn’t worth much. $100 in flight vouchers might cover a round trip flight somewhere, if I can find some of your lower cost fares that are going a place I want to go on one of your schedules that I can work with. This is assuming that I don’t want to check a bag.",-1
2019-12-15,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Palm Beach to Asheville,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,100% satisfied with them,True," Palm Beach to Asheville. Excellent service for a budget airline. No different than the ‘big ones’ out there. Cheap, but quality service. Allegiant gave me no issues rebooking my flight when my flight had the possibility of being redirected to a different airport. They even let me change it a second time without a change fee. They also accommodated my husband really well, they ended up refunding one of his tickets entirely and let him change another for free despite this not being their normal way of operating. The flights themselves are fine too, wonderful flight attendants and even the food and drinks aren’t that expensive to buy. The seats don’t recline, but they’re at a comfortable angle, something that’s great for a person with back issues like myself. It might become more uncomfortable on longer flights, but I only fly short flights with Allegiant. Flown a few times with them now and 100% satisfied with them. For a budget airline, they are on top of their game and give much more than I would otherwise expect from a budget airline. Will continue to fly with them for sure!",1
2019-12-11,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Harrisburg,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5,I got what I paid for,True,"  So I'm addressing the complaints of all the people who clearly didn't take the time to read the fine print. This isn't a fancy airline, my ticket was $48. I wasn't expecting premium service, seats, or attendants and I got what I paid for, which was perfectly adequate in all 3 cases. Yes, they ding you on the luggage. The information is however, literally the 1st thing found when you google ""baggage information Allegiant airline"". It's 40 lbs per bag, not 50 so I spent 30 minutes the night before pitching things to make my 2 bags each go from 43 and 44 lbs, to 37 and 38, respectively. I carry a travel luggage scale with me (best $10 you'll ever spend) and if you don't have 1, Walmart carries them, they weigh about an ounce. Upgrade to a seat with more leg room, you'll be glad of it. For $48 I felt like I could afford it and was reasonably sure I wasn't going to have to cough up an extra $50 per bag at check in. Again, glad I did. No, there's no complimentary anything on these flights, but so what? Get food and bring it with you! There were no delays so I can't comment on that, but it does seem to be a problem with this airline. The attendants were quite friendly, no complaints there. I get it guys, you're there at check in thinking one thing, only to hear something else. Maybe it's because I travel a lot, but it was honestly the work of 30 seconds to find out they only honor 40 lbs on their check in bags and yeah, you bet I was grateful I'd looked ahead of time. When I got to Harrisburg I went to Walmart and restocked what I'd thrown out. Cost? $13.66. Sure beat that $100 I'd have had to give them if I'd not been paying attention.",1
2019-12-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Evansville,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,never fly with them again,True,  Orlando to Evansville. In short I arrived at the gate for my flight at 12.33. Gates closed at 12.39. The girls at the gate told me my flight left at 12.30. Sent me downstairs. The flight had not left and this was misinformation that directly caused me to miss my flight. After one lie after another and changing stories to suit the airline I had to buy a new ticket. Airport manager told me the flight left early. Customer service (called them the next day) told me the flight did not leave early.  I told him in short the girls at the gate mistakenly sent me away. By the time we realized they were mistaken it was now to late! He repeated over and over that the gate closed at 12:39. I said well it was 12:33. He then changed his story and said well that’s a different gate the other gate closed earlier. They offered me a generous discount of a $75 new flight ticket. When I looked up the app it was priced at $61. They did nothing to acknowledge or accommodate us. I have 4 more flights booked with Allegiant between now and Jan and I will never fly with them again when these are seen through.,-1
2019-12-04,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St. Petersburg to Roanoke,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,2,no assistance with accommodation,False," Flight straight through from St. Petersburg to Roanoke. The flight was fine until we arrived in Roanoke. Our arrival and upcoming landing were announced. We came into heavy clouds in and out. The passengers were aware something was going on, but we weren't receiving information. About 30 mins later we were informed that the landing wasn't a good idea at that time. We were going to fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. After 45 min. being held on the plane we were told there wasn't going to be an improvement in the weather in Roanoke anytime soon. We could get off the plane there without our luggage and no assistance with accommodation or we could fly back to St. Petersburg where they could possibly help with hotel and food. There were multiple passengers making phone calls and discussing options. It was difficult to hear my husband so we could make a decision. There was no guarantee we would fly out of Florida the next day either. We chose to get off the plane in Knoxville, rent a car and drive the 6 hrs home. We were given our luggage since there were several passengers who chose to do the same. My mother in law covered all expenses. If not I'm not sure how we would have managed.",-1
2019-12-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Redmond,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,I wasn’t able to make my first flight,True,"  Phoenix to Redmond. My flight with disappointed me greatly with the circumstances which unfolded. I’m in the military and took a pass for the thanksgiving holiday to spend time with my family. I choose Allegiant due to the more reasonable flight prices. This flight gave me the ability to leave Wednesday afternoon and return late Sunday night. Due to military training running late I wasn’t able to make my first flight to meet my family and had to purchase a ticket for the following day. I don’t blame this on Allegiant which is why I was more than willing to purchase my one way ticket getting me home for the holiday the following day. As I have purchased a round trip ticket as long as I get home my return flight has been paid for and I will be able to use it to get back to my duty station. Come time to check in Sunday morning for my late afternoon flight my reservation, I already paid for, popped up as cancelled. Leaving me stranded without a way to get back to work. I called Allegiant immediately to inquire as to why I no longer had a reservation for my seat I paid for as a customer, they said they reserved the right to void my purchase and keep the funds without telling me about it. Essentially saying I, as the paying customer of a service am required to communicate, but Allegiant does not have to communicate. Allegiant left me no choice but for me to pay for another one way ticket for a seat on a flight I already paid for.  Moving forward allegiant will not be an airline I look to recommend as an airline I can trust or be reliable for myself, friends, family, or my Soldiers.",-1

The flight attendants were all very polite and extremely helpful. Food price is as expected for an airline. They don’t serve free food but it’s fair since the tickets are so cheap. Overall, it was a great experience for my family and I. It was my sons first time flying and the flight attendants got them to see the cockpit and meet the captains. Very cool.",1
2019-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando Sanford to Harrisburg,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Never again Allegiant Air,True,"  We fly Allegiant from Harrisburg to Orlando Sanford several times a year. Today will be our last. We had a 6 hour delay leaving Harrisburg for “engine repairs”. Now we get to Sanford to go hone and were very rudely handled by staff at the check in counter, the rudest customer service person I’ve ever dealt with. Now we just saw our 5pm flight is delayed till 7:30!  Everyone always says “get what you pay for”. Allegiant air is the epitome of that statement. Extremely rude customer service at their airport, phone customer service that runs you around in a phone loop and then hangs up and now flights delayed. Never again Allegiant Air. Where I come from if you treat customers like this, you are out of business.",-1
2019-11-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,,,,,,,1,Travel protection was joke,False,"  Indianapolis to Orlando. I needed to cancel our vacation plans. I only received a travel voucher and no refund option even with travel protection. There needs to be a huge screen that pops up to warn people who book that if you don’t go, you won’t get your money back even when you have the travel protection. I told them I don’t fly on a regular basis. I was a single mother trying to take a vacation; however, I had to cancel due to the cancellation of my sick family member. This airline deserves to go under. I give them 0/10 because their rude service, claiming that it was clearly stated on the website (which it is, hidden like teir contact information) and I waited on the phone for 28 minutes to not even have the chance to get my money refunded to help me out. Travel protection was joke.",-1
2019-11-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,This company is a sham,True,"  Indianapolis to Las Vegas. I flew out on Friday 11/22/19 1:32pm and was immediately delayed. Once we got on the plane I realized a couple things there is no creature comforts as in the chair doesn’t recline, WiFi or even padding on the seat. This is an absolute joke, but this is where it gets even better. My brother passes away on Saturday morning unexpectedly or I wouldn’t have left home. My wife called multiple times to get us home ASAP and was told we needed a death certificate no problem I will produce it when I receive it we called the same day Of his passing. Nor was I looking for a refund or sympathy I Just needed to get home. Well the best they could is get us on the Monday flight at 11:37am and we were delayed again til 8:30pm. I will not get home till 3am and have funeral arrangements to make at 8am Tuesday. This is absolutely the most ridiculous encounter I have ever been involved in with a corporation. I will continue to spend the extra money on a different reputable airline since I was not allowed to specifically name one I use frequently. This company is a sham.",-1

After being loaded onto the plane, they told us there was an oil leak and we could not leave. They were unable to find the mechanic for an hour. After sitting on the plane for over an hour, we were deplaned. We got notifications from our phone that it was delayed about an hour. This continued until the flight was delayed 7 hours. We were only offered a $50 voucher for waiting 7 hours. This was my first and last time using Allegiant.",-1
2019-11-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Grand Rapids,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,We did not even get an explanation,False,  Extremely disappointed with Allegiant Air. I will not suggest this airline to anyone. It will be my absolute last choice to ever fly with them again. Poor communication about delay. Kept setting back our delay. Ended up being over a 6 hour delay leaving us up the entire night. My total travel time was close to 11 hours. I could of driven to Grand Rapids in less time then it took to wait around for this flight that continued to get pushed back. They did nothing to work with us. We should be getting money back. This should not be happening. We did not even get an explanation of why we were delayed.,-1
2019-11-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Albany to Punta Gorda,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a pretty awful experience,False,"  Albany to Punta Gorda. Worst airline, worst travel experience ever. This was the classic ""bait & switch"" tactic. Allegiant reels you in with promises of inexpensive flights only to up-charge you on everything. Started out with 2 tickets for $107. By the time we were done, it was nearly $400. The 40lb. weight limit on bags is laughable and purely designed to get customers to pony up an additional $50 per bag for even the slightest overage. The check-in agents were rude ... one of them even caused a scene that led to the line being slowed for nearly 10 minutes. The planes are crammed with no room to place your carry-on under the seat. We were traveling with our small emotional support dog (which they charged us for despite documentation). He was in a carrier that fit the airline's prescribed parameters, but we couldn't get him far enough under the seat because of the limited space. The flight attendant told us he needed to go further under the seat, but that was impossible. We finally convinced her we couldn't get him any further under the seat without hurting him, but she didn't make it easy. The plane took forever to take off as we sat for quite sometime before we even began to taxi. All in all, it was a pretty awful experience. As one commenter mentioned, you shouldn't waste your money. Fly a real airline instead. It really made us appreciate airlines like Southwest so much more. I've deleted the Allegiant app from my phone. I only wish I could delete any memory of this travel experience.",-1
2019-11-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Indianapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,Worst airline experience,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Indianapolis. Force you to put your carry on in a tiny, undersized test bin before boarding - only to be forced to pay more - even if it would have fitted on the plane. The test bin is intentionally smaller than the overhead compartments. Baggage claim takes forever, gate agents are rude and flight attendants are rude. Worst airline experience by far.",-1

The seats are crammed and uncomfortable. I am not sure what the money for our flights pays for other than the salary of the workers. Some of the times you spend more time on the plane waiting for take-off then actually on the flight. The attendents have no answers and I don't think it's because they aren't telling us it's because no one is telling them. I would rather spend more money to drive further and use a reliable airline. Don't waste your money.,-1

Apparently, I didn't fill out the correct paperwork to have my service dog go with me on the flight. My friend was still waiting for me, because I never took my service dog. Next time I'll fill out proper paperwork. Lollipop did so incredible when I was in hospital for 4 months and I was really proud of her going through security and Airport. She got very nervous up Escalade and doesn't like elevators. Just want to thank Courtney & Sebastian again for helping me make my flight and being extremely nice and professional.

They get you under the guise of cheap flights but charges you for every little thing. Boarding passes are $5. You have to pay for carry on bags. Pre-paid $30 for a checked bag, get to the gate and my luggage is 45lbs. Every other airline is 50lbs, but Allegiant limit is 40lbs. They charged me $50 for the extra 5lbs.",-1
2019-10-21,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Harrisburg,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,5,Priority boarding and drinks included,True,"  Punta Gorda to Harrisburg. Living near one of the Allegient Air airport routes (15 min from home), our family has travelled 10-15 times from Allentown, PA to Punta Gorda and from Punta Gorda to Harrisburg, PA to visit son at college. We knew ahead of time the airline was no frills and gets from point a to point b. I have never had any issues with the airline and instead have seen multiple flights take off and land ahead of time. Once they have the plane boarded, they are free to take off which ends up with early arrival. I recommend purchasing the tickets at the airport whenever possible as they will exclude the tax which is about $35-40 per RT ticket. We also use flex trip which allows for unlimited changes to your flight. The seats on all aircraft I’ve flown have been redone however still do not recline which some look at as a problem (unless your the 6’4 person behind the recliner). For flights that are less than 2.5 hours, this airline has been better than average and much more convenient than driving from Newark or Phila on east to take national brand carrier. We have also used their credit card which pays for itself after the first flight. Priority boarding and drinks included with credit card as well as credit to be used on any portion of future ticket. Both kids are in college and have airports within 20 minutes where Allegiant flies to our home area. I’ve been platinum on other name brand airlines and have chosen Allegiant for these regional flights which have made life much easier for our family. The delays mentioned on reviews are I’m sure real however weather in some of those areas would have any airline grounded. Hopefully Allegient Air can get their act together with this and come up with a stronger marketing campaign to advance their efficient brand.",1
2019-10-21,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Asheville to Sanford,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,On time and friendly,False,  Asheville to Sanford. On time and friendly. The hidden fees are not hidden if one reads everything prior to booking. Cancellation policies are clearly stated as are the different types of refunds. Seating policies are also clearly stated. Booking at same time and then “hoping” to be together is a guarantee of unhappiness. I believe many frustrated passengers are simply not reviewing the policies of Allegiant. This is a company in business to make money by offering true budget flight options. If you want frills go with a different airline.,1

Horrible communication, delayed flight for 12 hours. Customer service continues to flail arms while just asking for updates. Terrible experience. $16 food voucher for 12 hour delay when the cheapest item in restaurant is $16.50. 0 compensation. I appreciate cheap flights but this company has no class.",-1

Flights weren’t on time, no complimentary drinks/snacks, gave me a hard time for not taking facial cleansing wipes out of my bag. Wasn’t enough room for everyone’s carry-on luggage. Also, their carry on size is way smaller than other airlines so if your carry on fits on a different airline it doesn’t mean it will with them. Every little thing costs extra, by the time you pay for it’s around the same price to fly with a better airline.",-1

I have flown this route a few times and I will say that the flight attendants are the rudest and nastiest people in the industry. Rather than communicate professionally and assume the best the flight attendants verbally jump on customers about their regulations. I’m sure that they have a lot of crazy people they deal with but chill out. I hope the attendants can find joy in the journey. I’m sure it comes from the management and translates down to the customers and you do get what you pay for. I’m so glad that there are other choices.,-1
2019-10-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Shreveport to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,has gone downhill over the years,False,"  Have flown several different times throughout the years. It was a great deal back then, but has gone downhill over the years. First, the price has sky rocketed with no additional services, you do not get peanuts or a drink without paying additionally for them now! The flight attendants were more interested in taking selfies than attending to the passengers. It is not fun to fly this airline and unless absolutely necessary I will not go on this airline again. Actually, its much cheaper nowadays to take a few extra days and just drive, my husband and I could have left Wednesday and got to Vegas Thursday afternoon. Stayed until Sunday and been home Monday evening for half the cost of this flight and hotel accommodations at the Luxor. At the Resort the room was shabby, popcorn ceilings were falling down, room smelled musty, asked for a King Size Bed but had to settle for a Queen size, I paid for a package deal which cost us over $1500 for 3 nights and the hotel charged another $150 for resort fees for no additional services. We will not choose this again there are many better places to stay and for a better value. Done with Allegiant unless its the only thing available.",-1

2019-09-28,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Pittsburgh,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,3.0,2,staff courteous,True," Punta Gorda to Pittsburgh. Airline staff on ground and in flight courteous. However, expect to wait, wait and wait if you have any need that must be addressed via telephone. Over an hour for me personally. Multiple occasions. ""Biggest Complaint"" is being forced to pay an additional $112 this trip to pick up a rental vehicle at PIT airport that was prepaid many days earlier and itinerary updates up to a few hours prior to flight verified the original charges. This was all booked in advance using my Allegiant app. Very dishonest to take advantage of a person away with an expectation that proper planning was done to secure transportation. You can either pay extra unexpected charges to get the vehicle you reserved or Walk away without it.",-1
2019-09-17,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Medford to Los Angeles,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0,2,just let it be over soon,False,"  Medford to Los Angeles. This is the first time I had flown Allegiant Airlines. Ticket counter agents seemed to take longer to process people than other airlines. While waiting at the gate, the time became close to boarding time, but nothing happened, no announcements, etc. The time eventually even passed takeoff time with everyone still waiting to board and no announcements regarding the delay. Finally, we boarded the plane an hour after scheduled takeoff time and the captain on board the plane explained over the intercom that something happened earlier in the day to throw off the schedule and ""they hoped to make it up to us in the future"" (an odd statement, given that it is impossible to make up a time delay). So we are an hour behind our takeoff time and the ticket agent (now on board the plane) begins to call out particular passenger names to see if these people are on board. I'm wondering, wouldn't they already know who's onboard from the tickets being scanned at the gate? Then the same agent begins going down the rows, one by one, saying the first name of each passenger that is supposed to be in that seat and wanting those passengers to confirm their identity. I had never seen this before in all my years of flying (I'm 58 years old). I'm thinking, there must be an easier way! I took some Benadryl prior to the flight for allergies, hoping that it would knock me out and I would have a blissful nap en route but, lo and behold, the seats don't recline, even the slightest bit (no button on the armrests, etc.). When did this become normal? How am I supposed to nod off in the full upright position? The seats are also thinner (less cushion) than those of other airlines. Oh well, I'll just read the inflight magazine. But it is very thin as well, more like a pamphlet, without any interesting articles. I look at the beverages available on the flight and I see that there is a charge for everything. Not even a free soda like other airlines. Aren't sodas about 12 cents a can when purchased in bulk? Well, I'm not paying $3 for a 12 cent soda! Apparently I'm not the only fussy passenger - there is a baby behind me that starts crying which inspires other babies to start crying. Unfortunately, they are healthy babies with lots of energy and they don't stop crying for most of the remainder of the flight. I'm thinking, ""Oh please, God, just let it be over soon"". We finally touch down. Babies still crying. One hour after our scheduled departure time. Never again.",-1
2019-09-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tucson to Provo,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Would not recommend,False,"  Tucson to Provo. The crew was rude, especially one flight attendant.

They charge for every little thing so they advertise and cheap and affordable, when really they are the same price as any other airline. Would not recommend.",-1
2019-09-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Knoxville,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3,issues with myallegiant website,True,"  FT Lauderdale to Knoxville. This my seem trite, but has anyone experienced issues with being able to view and or change their flights through manage travel on myallegiant website. I have had this issue since December 2018. When logging in I receive an error message that reads: An unexpected error has occurred and we are looking into it. Please try again later. I have been receiving this message since December 2018. I have talked, chatted and emailed Allegiant multiple times and keep getting blown off. This may seem trivial, but I will tell you this, when you are attempting to evacuate your daughter from a hurricane and relying on Allegiant website to manage and change flights it becomes much more. The last time this happened, just recently during Hurricane Dorian, I had to phone customer service, I was on hold for over three hours in the middle of the night before I needed to evacuate her and when I finally reached the agent and explained my situation the agent hung up on me. I can assure you I was courteous and professional while attempting to remedy the situation. This is in no way how anyone should be treated during a difficult time such as this. Thankfully for my daughter things worked out ok. I would hate to think someone in a much more affected area had the same plight.",-1

2019-09-01,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Pete Clearwater to South Bend,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,5,a very stressful situation,True,"  St Pete Clearwater to South Bend. The original flight for me was to return on August 28th. We left with plenty of time to spare. Traffic was backed up and horrendous. There was a very bad accident on the freeway, and we made it to the airport at 8:45am. The plane was to leave at 9:00am. My daughter and I had no bags to check and I was already prechecked in and ready to go. We knew it was a longshot, but we went straight to the gate just to see if I can make it. We were informed that the plane had already left. We looked at our app that had originally still said 9:00 AM it changed to the plane had left at 8:51 AM. We remained calm and went to the ticket counter to see what could be done. As time passed and the lady continued to attempt to help us, she let us know we would be charged 75 dollars as a comp fee for a flight on Saturday. We immediately felt upset and I had a panic attack. People behind us had also missed their flight and began to complain. The woman and another woman behind the counter began to become upset with those of us that missed our flight stating that we should have been there two hours prior. We asked to speak to a manager. The second woman kept saying “well many others were here on time, they were two hours early as you should have been, we can’t hold the plane for you”.  We kept saying “we know you can’t hold the plane that’s not what we’re asking we don’t understand why we have to pay again when it’s not our fault that we missed“. We explained to the lady that we did not want to compare ourselves to others that were not on the road when we were on the road that were not affected by the accident like we were affected. She appeared to have no remorse. As they began to get a manager they asked those of us that missed the flight to step aside to another side and that we would be served once he came to the counter. A family came up and got in line and it had been maybe two minutes before a gentleman came to the counter, one of the people who missed their flight was a little old woman who went up to him thinking he must be the manager. However they told her that she needed to wait her turn that those behind her were actually in line, and had been waiting an hour to check in for their flight. Although maybe their perception of an hour is different or maybe it was the stress, but those people had just gotten there and those of us that were waiting for figuration of our missed flight and the cost of a second flight since it was not our fault that we missed our plane, we had only been waiting maybe 30 minutes if not less. What seemed like an eternity during the situation was really not that long, and those of us that had missed our flight were the only ones standing in line until they moved us aside and a family came up right behind us. Overall it was a very stressful situation with customers just wanting some clarification and understanding from the company and workers of the company just not having remorse and probably feeling stressed themselves as well. Overall the manager came and comped to all the flights for free for those of us who were involved in the freeway of the accident that had occurred and we were not able to make it to the airport. Although we greatly appreciate the consideration and understanding and compassion of their manager it still can’t be helped to feel uncomfortable or uneasy and just simply sad and stressed over it all.",1

You cannot phone in a complaint at all. Their live chat is limited to business hours, Monday thru Friday. Other wise, you can snail mail, or email. The email form provided is not designed for complaints, quite the opposite. I was moved from a premium seat I paid for to an inferior seat because of my oxygen concentrator. The only thing they did was refund the $15. Absolutely no other concerns as to how that decision was made, it's effect on me and my health, nothing. They simply don't care.",-1

We have spent much the whole day at the airport because our flight has been delayed 3 times. This is inexcusable. How can they think that it is ok to mess with people's lives like this! We only had two days in Vegas with one day spent at the G#D Dam# airport because this airline can not seem to get their act together! We will never fly with this poor excuse of a company ever again!

Arrive 2 hours in advance for domestic flights only to have your flights delayed(see attached). They let a passenger onboard who was not supposed to be on the flight we were on and the only reason they figured it out was because the seat had been sold to someone else. You cannot even take a nap on your flight because the flight attendants are broadcasting and distributing snacks in a loud manner If you have another airline you can choose (which I didn't flying to Asheville besides Spirit) easy choice, anything but Allegiant. Every seat on the airline is the same (seats do not move no leg room or place to fit a water bottle on the A320), they try and fit as many people on the plane it seems and delay departure times to fill every seat. Best of all they charge you for everything. Bring snacks",-1

The flight crew Kristen, Michelle and the other two lovely ladies went out of their way to make this flight perfect! I had an emergency happen and needed a personal hygiene product and the girls came to my rescue! They were so interactive with my two children and made my girls feel so comfortable during the flight. Allegiant Air is our carrier of choice as it’s close and convenient to where we live in Lake Mary, FL! And I just want to give a shout out to the entire crew for a job well done!!",1

She arrived at airport, checked her bag, ( which they took and put on the flight!) went through customs, got to her terminal and was told they closed it and wasn’t allowed on! The people who work there were terribly rude to her. First, why would they allow your luggage to go on the flight if they were no longer taking passengers, second, she was not they only one this happened to, there were 5 other people they did this to. We have used Their airline many times, this was the first incident we’ve had. Very disappointed in their customer service. Horrible experience for a lot of people that day!",-1

I was thrilled to find these tickets - super price, free checked bags and carryon bag if you bring your veteran card or DD214, 3 miles from my home, and the Allegiant employees were professional and efficient. Cons do include the inconvenience of waiting in line. You must pay a fee if you want seat assignment. There’s not even water available without a fee. The seats are very narrow. Tips: get there early. Don’t take an over-weight bag. Get your bags tagged. Enjoy the cheap flight.",1
2019-07-17,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Grand Junction,2.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5,Everything went without a hitch,True,"  I have seen a lot of negative reviews about Allegiant and I have to admit that it was with some trepidation that I decided to take a trip with them. I don't normally submit a review but I wanted to share my experience. The fee-happy structure is intimidating and your experience can be different than what you are used to on another airline. At the Airport, plan for more time at the ticket counter. Individual flights seem to have their own line. Don't get in the wrong line. Plan on more time with the ticket counter agent. If you are checking a bag or carrying on a bag, they will review this information with you. You will receive a tag for your carry on. Your carry on luggage may well be considered ""too large"" and will need to be checked. Similarly, your checked bag can only be 40 lbs (most airlines give you 50 lbs). Make sure your luggage conforms to their published dimensions and weight. What is considered carry-on size for Delta may need to be checked on Allegiant. There is a lot of homework to do or you could end up with an unpleasant surprise. What I found that WAS a very pleasant surprise is that if you are a veteran and can prove it - you can check up to 3 bags and a carry on for FREE! It is the most generous offering in the industry. There are other perks for veterans too, so check their website for a full,detailed list. The flight was on time, the flight crew was pleasant. They made it quite clear that nothing on that beverage and snack cart was free and they went through the cabin very quickly. It was easy to move around since the the carts swept through the cabin much quicker than airlines which give complimentary snacks and beverages. The chairs (I won't call them seats) were narrow, hard and did not recline. For the hour flight we had, it was fine. For the price, I did not mind at all. For my destination, they make only two flights per week. Its a little scary to think about a cancelled flight, so that is a risk you must be willing to take. Everything went without a hitch and i got to spend a great weekend with my friends and I could not have driven there for the cost of the flight. With their generous perks for veterans and the attractive pricing, I am for sure, a satisfied Allegiant customer.",1
2019-07-17,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Sanford to Rochester,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,just told no as an answer,True,"  Sanford to Rochester. I have booked many trips on Allegiant as I book for a construction crew and for myself. I have enjoyed the prices that they offer and always get Trip Flex for bookings. A couple weeks ago, I booked a business trip for myself to go to Rochester. Today, I learned that my colleague's mother is in heart failure and wanted to change my flight to next week to allow him to have time to gather himself. A simple task? Well apparently, somehow I did not purchase Trip Flex this time and I discovered this when trying to change the flight to next week. I tried to call and chat to get help. I typically use Allegiant or Southwest depending upon the city that I am going to. Well, it is almost an hour later and am still on hold waiting for a human. Octavia came onto the chat with me 30 minutes after trying to initiate a chat. I can tell you that my level of frustration was already elevated. When I explained the situation the attitude was less than having any interest in helping me and I got links to terms and conditions.  I was not given the opportunity to speak to a supervisor and was just told no as an answer. I will tell you that I have spent almost 5k dollars in the past 6 months booking flights on Allegiant but will no longer utilize them based on their inflexibility. I have never asked for any special treatment and needed some help this one time. What a business model! Instead of trying to get a supervisor, they simply disconnected the chat. I did not use profanity of any kind and was simply demanding to speak to someone who would help me. Octavia did not say she was disconnecting as she could not help me or anything else. She simply and abruptly disconnected the chat! What kind of customer service and lack of compassion is this? I can assure you that I will spend a tiny bit more with a competitor to have the flexibility that I need.",-1

Truly the most disorganized experience I’ve ever had, and this applies both to and from our destination. Both times aircraft were not fueled enough to make the trip so passengers waited over an hour for take off. By the time the aircraft was fueled a storm hit and we not only had to sit on the plane and for an additional hour but the route was changed extending the flight by half an hour.

The person in charge of the boarding process was very rude to me and my friends . I fly with Allegiant all the time and generally I find good affordable deals! Other than the couple times my flight has got canceled, but I’ve managed to accommodate. However the service I’ve had today was unbelievable, not only was she rude but she made me and my friends step out of line for no apparent reason.  It’s one thing if we’re doing something wrong but at least treat us with respect.",1

Online I was told several different refund amounts. I paid over $200 for my flight originally and ended up only being refunded $28. I canceled 14 days before the flight date. Don't ever try to contact the customer service line, 1-702-505-8888. I was on hold for over 90 minutes and eventually hung up because I got no where. I never even spoke to a representative. Smaller airline companies such as Spirit and Frontier blow this company out of the water, and believe me those other 2 airline companies are't anything special to write home about. If you have two legs I would recommend walking to your destination before taking this airline.",-1

Then a lady behind us asked the lady if she could skip the line because she had a flight that left in 15 minutes. The manager asked her where she was going and told her she had plenty of time because all of Allegiant was using 1 gate and there was a line of planes. So after paying $50 more for a carry on bag, my family arrived to the gate only to be told that the plane already left. They also charge for everything. Need a boarding pass? $5 need to bring a carry on? $50. They would not even refund the $50 for the carry on that was just paid for. On top of that, good luck getting in contact with the 702-505-8888 customer service department",-1

I paid for priority check in and They had me standing in line letting all the regular passengers go before us. By the time they called me it was an hour before my flight was scheduled to depart. They said I was late and wouldn’t let me board. They told me since I got there an hour before instead of two hours prior I forfeited my flight. They kept my money and they also kept my car rental money, since I did it with them. It felt like a scam. They were extremely rude and unwilling to help accommodate us. I was traveling with two minors. This airline’s staff was extremely unprofessional. The first thing the girl at the counter asked me, was if I had rented a car through them. As soon as they saw that I had a car rented through them, they pushed to make us miss the flight. It turns out that I called enterprise and I had the right to cancel and get full credit until 8PM. However, since I did it through air allegiant I couldn’t. They have to do it. This is probably why they were unwilling to help us make the flight.  I tried to get someone on the phone and explain my situation and they just don’t care. The plane was empty, it was a local flight, they had an hour before take off, and they didn’t help me. I felt like if I was in the twilight zone. Don’t waste your money or your time.",-1

Flight was one of the most horrible experiences I've ever had. Leaving Las Vegas was delayed 2.5 hours and we were given no explanation of why when our plane was already in Las Vegas and the weather was clear. Terrible customer service as well - no representative at the gate until 10 minutes prior to boarding and then boarding was delayed another 30 minutes while we all were standing around waiting. At the end of the trip we did not save any more money or time by flying Allegiant. Last time I will waste my money and time with this company.",-1

We had our two kids with us as well so believe me when I say we arrived in plenty of time. Upon arriving to check our bags with Allegiant the line at McCarren airport was out the door with only two people checking in bags. We stood in line for so long that I had to pretend I was handicapped to make the flight for our wedding and was only able to do so because I had my dress as a carry on. While giving our bags to check in (which I had checked one online and we had to check another) I was told I did not pre pay for a checked bag ($35) which we had done everything online and had our confirmation. Also, we paid over $700 over three months ago for our family of four to fly to Memphis again and they had us on standy! We had to literally beg for our seats on this flight. Absolute horrible experience from the get go. On the way back to Vegas, Memphis airport only had 1 person checking in bags! We were in line again for over an hour! Also, we tried once again to pre check bags since it’s cheaper, this time it would not let us pre check ANYTHING or even check in early because we had our children with us and they had placed us all in different seats. So, due to Allegiant Ais inefficiency, we were over charged on this trip over $100 because of luggage, their inadequate app they try to get you to use and double charging us for luggage. This was an all around horrible experience and we will never fly Allegiant again. Much better off paying the extra money and being comfortable and taken care of on a Southwest or Delta flight.",-1

Flight was delayed 45 mins and they did not even consider it a delay, I guess because this is their normal? No big deal. Had a okay flight, little bumpy but I wasn’t as phased as many. Ready to get back home, waited for checked bag for almost an hr. Grab it, scuff marks down the back of the suitcase and handle bent it is now not functional. Made a claim, as well all know suitcases are pricey, they state it varies from what damage they would intend to see if they were responsible. Long story short they won’t be covering a thing! Be careful, my “cheap” flight cost me a lot more in the end. (All of this after changing my original flight by five hrs a month before take off)",-1

Not enough staffing at the baggage check desk and generally not very impressed by the overall quality of the flight experience with Allegiant Air. I will not fly with them again because they tout amazing deals on flights, but you always get what you pay for and the cheaper tickets is equivalent to a cheaper experience.",-1

First, I was so sceptical about it, I was worried if we would get to our destination because it was so cheap and it’s a direct flight from Savannah to Albany. At first, I booked our flight using another airline and the total was $1471 and we had to stop in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Allegiant Air flight was so much cheaper, for 4 of us only cost $580. So, I canceled the other airline tickets and booked with Allegiant Air. Our flight went smoothly from Savannah to Albany, no delay and the flight attendants were super nice to us, even the pilots. So from now on if there is an Allegiant Air going where I want to go I’ll always use this airlines. Yes, they charge you for your snacks and drinks but hey for the money I save that’s no problem to me. I rate them 10/10. Great, great experienced, I saved money and time.",1

No explanation why. 2 hours later I was again notified by text that the flight was delayed another 2 hours for a total delay of 4 hours. I called the airline to see if I could take a different flight in the morning because my mom and dad would have to pick me up at the airport at 1:04 AM instead of 9:22 PM. I was on hold for over an hour and finally gave up on that. Once in the air. I was never offered a refreshment from a flight attendant. in fact was never even offered a glance from any of the 4 attendants despite having paid a premium to sit in Seat 1D first row isle. Attendants sat up front and conversed with each other the whole flight. At 12:20 the pilot announced that we could not land at punta gorda airport and will be diverted to St Petersburg 2.5 hours from Punta Gorda. We were told that they had no way to transport us from there, there were no rental cars available. My Mom and Dad had to drive 2.5 hours to pick me up and 2.5 hours home.

This is by far the worst customer service I have experienced. I’ve flown with Allegiant 6 times since January 2019. There has been some sort of dilemma each and every time. I am currently on hold (and have been for 52 minutes) to simply get some information regarding a trip I have booked with them. I am also on their chat (which they advertise for faster service) and keep getting connected to “null” who does not reply to any of my messages.  Spend the extra $100 to go with a better airline that cares about their customers or is at least staffed to take phone calls/chats for those customers that need help once they have purchased their tickets. Funny how simple it is to book a flight with them, but will have you burn your ear off waiting for someone to answer their customer service line. Thank god for speaker phone.",-1

When I asked if I could weigh it to see how the weight was she told me I had to wait in line, so I did. When I got to the front of the line my bag was now (41.5 lbs) and she said that if I wanted to go through I had to pay $112. Therefore she made me go empty my bag and get back on the line.

My fiancé had 2 flight (round trip) scheduled and paid in full for an out of state job interview. I have to accommodate on a conflicting schedule and had to arrive a little earlier and couldn’t make the first flight. I had plan to fly back on the return flight. Unbeknownst to us, Allegiant decided to cancel the entire flight including the return flight as well? What kind of service is this? I agreed, the flex trip wasn’t paid for so the 1st flight should be cancel without a refund. No problem, but for them to also cancel the return flight that we had paid for separately is just plain straight scam! This airline is the worst and comes up with tactic and loop hole like this to scam people. So if you plan on doing a round trip without a flex trip fee paid, it’s best if you just pay one way each so if Allegiant cancel the flight you missed, then they won’t be able to cancel the other one as well. Such an incompetent airline and this is how they scam people. A con artist airline that is out there with tons of small loop holes to scam customers. It was on the last day and we were put on hold for more than an hour. Didn’t want to argue with the lady on the phone so the lady said she will only charge us an additional $75 and she will be able to get me back on the return flight. So in addition to having to pay for the return flight I’m being charged an extra $75 because apparently it’s in their policy that if we missed the first flight, then the entire flight that was scheduled will be cancelled. So I question if the flight was to be scheduled separately then, they can’t automatically cancelled the entire flight?",-1

Meanwhile the on time plane next to us had left. Still not one Sorry about that. We have flown Allegiant dozens of times and after the bad publicity would think they would pull up their socks.

It’s $75 per trip per person bringing our cancelation fees to $150 per person being that it was a round trip flight. For 2 people. Which means the total cancelation fees were $300 for my husband and I. We rented a car on top of that as well. They wouldn’t refund our money instead they offered a voucher to fly with them again (which why in the world would we want to do that?) and the voucher would only be for $122.

Leaving vacation a day early is completely not what I want to do, basically told me I was lying after sending them an obituary and everything.

We've had terrible experiences with Allegiant Air and will never fly with them again. It's a cheap airline and travelers do get what they pay for, which is a lot of inconvenience. We've flown 4 round trips with Allegiant and all eight legs of our journeys were marred by delays and cancellations. Allegiant always has ready-made, convenient ""reasons"" for the delays and cancellations (like mysterious ""mechanical issues"") but it boils down to the fact that they don't fly any plane that isn't booked to full capacity. If there are any empty seats on your flight, chances are your plane is going to be delayed or cancelled altogether. I can't believe it took me four round trips to come to the realization that this is their pattern. In June 2016 they delayed our flight 4 times over the course of 8 hours and then cancelled the flight just prior to boarding because the crew had ""timed out"" of their work hours for the 24 hour period. Yes, the crew ""timed out"" because they kept delaying our flight for unknown reasons! We've lost entire days of our vacation and hotel costs because of Allegiant. Also, their customer service is horrible. I've waited over two hours on hold (speakerphone) before I finally gave up. They don't answer their phones or respond to online inquiries or emails.

The flights themselves weren't bad but the delays and how we were treated while waiting was the worst of it. On our way to our destination we were delayed about 12 hours, in 30 min/1 hr/2 hr increments overnight - from 8 pm until 8 am the next morning. I was 21 weeks pregnant at the time and sick with a terrible cold and would have gladly even paid for myself to go sleep in a hotel (though they should be paying for it or offering some kind of reimbursement) had they just told us our flight wasn't leaving until the next morning but instead they kept coming up with excuses and making us think we were leaving soon and then pushing it up even further. One of the worst nights of my life at the airport. Flights were not delayed due to weather or ""unpredictable"" circumstnaces but due to staffing and airplane scheduling and maintenance issues. Staff were very unapologetic and not kind whatsoever. On the return flight we didnt think anything would be delayed because it couldn't possibly happen twice but again the flight was delayed 4 hours (not so bad this time) but also was delayed in short increments, when likely they could just tell everyone the truth from the get go. Our flights with Allegiant were $350 for two passengers round trip, so cheap, but i would have gladly paid twice the money not to deal with them again.",-1

When I asked the flight attendant about the incoherence of my carry on, the only answer was “I do not know”.

I can't believe it took me four round trips to come to the realization that this is their pattern. In June 2016 they delayed our flight 4 times over the course of 8 hours and then cancelled the flight just prior to boarding because the crew had ""timed out"" of their work hours for the 24 hour period. Yes, the crew ""timed out"" because they kept delaying our flight for unknown reasons! We've lost entire days of our vacation and hotel costs because of Allegiant. Also, their customer service is horrible. I've waited over two hours on hold (speakerphone) before I finally gave up. They don't answer their phones or respond to online inquiries or emails.  I will pay more to get to my destination on time. Buyer beware!",-1
2019-04-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Indianapolis to Jacksonville,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Both flights were delayed,True,  Indianapolis to Jacksonville. Both flights were delayed. Not slightly but by hours. Not weather related. I fly frequently with standard airlines. Tried this airline once and only once.,-1
2019-04-21,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Belleville to Phoenix,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,so happy and grateful,True,"  I left my wallet on the plane without realizing it. When I returned to the airport the next day, a very kind Allegiant employee took the time to walk me over to the Lost and Found. It was closed, however, she used her ID badge to go in herself (not her assigned duty that day) and found and returned it to me after I confirmed my ID. The $100 cash was still in my wallet, although I was happiest that I would not have to replace all my cards! I asked this employee if she would accept cash as a thank you and she declined. She was just very happy for me. It’s how someone responds when the chips are down that you see a person’s or a company’s true colors. I was so happy and grateful not just for this employee but also for the employees who found my wallet initially and delivered it to Lost and Found. Thank you Allegiant Air employees!",1
2019-04-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Sarasota,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,budget bare bones airline,True," Indianapolis to Sarasota. My husband and I have both flown Allegiant in the past. We know that it’s a definitely a budget bare bones airline. However they recently started a route that flies directly to his parents hometown so we thought how do we pass that up? I’m a nurse so the best way I can write this review and explain would be in military time. Day one 0800 - get an alert on our phone that our 0900 flight will be delayed about an hour. We were instructed to wait in the gate area. Announced that for weather reasons the flight may take off at 1000, they will keep up posted. Boarded flight and take off around 1030 to Sarasota destination. 1200 get an announcement on the plane that we are about 50min our from our destination and are beginning our descent. 1230, updated that a plane ahead of us encountered bad weather and we are being rerouted to Destin, Florida so we can refuel and then take off once the storm has passed. Water and Chex mix were passed out. Taxied around Destin on the plane until about 1340 and then are given the option to get off the plane at Destin. Three other Allegiant flights had also been detoured. The tiny Destin airport was completely overwhelmed with an hour long Quiznos line and a handful of outlets that were being guarded for dear life. 1530 got an announcement all flights to Sarasota should reboard. Boarded, watched the seatbelt demonstration etc and were taxing for about 45min assuming that we were just waiting our turn to take off. 1630 announced that our plane didn’t pass one of the maintenance checks and that they needed to have some people come out and work on the plane. 1700 from the captain “well the bad news just keeps on coming” now our crew was reaching their maximum work time and they would need to find a new crew. 1710 - deboarded for a second time. Announced overhead the flight would be leaving around 1800. 1755 - announced our flight was canceled and would be rescheduled for the following day at 0700. All chaos then ensued. In the announcement it was said to see the ticket counter for our voucher for a hotel and meal. One long line of our entire flight (200 people) wrapped around the ticket area and multiple times we were instructed to split off into different lines that ended up making zero sense. Two times we followed the instructions given by Allegiant staff that ended up having us in a completely different area while the main line continued to move. People were absolutely heated and little to no information was being distributed. Where were these hotels? How would we get there? Destin is a small city with only a handful of Ubers. We were asked by one Allegiant staff member in a loud tone “if we even knew how a line worked.” Probably not the tone you want to use with a bunch of confused customers who have been standing in lines and waiting going on 12 hours. Then without warning the line structure went out the window and the Allegiant staff started yelling out passenger names with the paper voucher in their hands. Three employees were yelling names over each other and sometimes just using first names, not very helpful. To the lucky that got their names called they got a second piece of paper with five hotel options we could call and book to see if they had availability for us, a few hotels didn’t even know if they accepted the Allegiant voucher so that was not encouraging. Unfortunately we never got our names called so we waited in the ticket counter line for over an hour and got our voucher around 1945.",-1
2019-04-21,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Asheville,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3,Left gate late as usual,False,"  Orlando to Asheville. Left gate late as usual - 30 minutes, when landed we sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes. Poor planning on Allegiant part especially into a very small airport. Do not recommend this company. Charge cheap rates until you pay $50 for a 40lb bag and charged for soft drinks.",-1
2019-04-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Grand Rapids,,,,,,1.0,1,at the gate 2 minutes late,True,"  Orlando to Grand Rapids. There were 5 different passengers (not traveling together) who were at the gate 2 minutes late. They would not let us on. The door to the jetway was still open and they had 13 minutes before departure. We were all 1-2 minutes late, ran from security, the security line was unusually long. Then, we were selected for secondary screening. I’ve never been turned away from a flight while there are still people on the jetway. Very unaccommodating. Very unprofessional. Will not be flying Allegiant again. They just made $75 pp to have us re-book. What a scam.",-1
2019-04-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mid-America to St. Petersburg/Clearwater,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not be getting on this flight,True,"  I left St. Petersburg/Clearwater I traveled with them before so I knew we get one personal item so I use the same bag each time when traveling. My flight there went as usual as planned. On April 15th I was due to return home with the same bag. After going thru TSA, I went and took a seat to wait to for my flight as I was waiting I see a Allegiant Rep/ Mid-America Airport worker coming to passengers on the flight asking them if they have a personal item or carry on mind you I have my bag sitting next to me she never once said anything to me she tagged people’s bag who she said she felt wasn’t a personal item - she looked and me sitting there and my bag and still said nothing to me. Well about an hour later they start calling my flight, as I was walking up toaboard the flight the same woman said “that’s too big for a personal item” very rudely and stern. I said  I flew here with this and never had a problem before with prior travel, she said your not getting on my plane with the bag unless you pay for it. She took my bag and put it in the slot to see if it fit in the personal items (which it did) she says it’s still to big so at this point I’m frustrated and want to get home so I go to another representative and tell her to look my reservation up and she said she found my reservation so I offered to pay for my bag and I would take it up with Allegiant when I got home. She said well your bag is free I’m not going to charge you because you will not be getting on this flight.",-1
2019-04-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Raleigh,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3,Never again Allegiant,True,"  Punta Gorda to Raleigh. Never Again. One way ticket to RDU. Purchased on a Monday, flight on Friday (only flight of the day at 6am), 95 bucks, good deal! First time flyer with Allegiant Air. Arrive in lobby, no self check in kiosks. Go to counter to confirm reservation email / confirmation code. Speak with nice lady, she says “Yes, I have you here, you’ve completed your self check in online, however you will require a boarding pass.” She further explains that the Allegiant app would be able to provide that in the future. Ready? Hard copy of the eticket boarding pass? 5 bucks. Make it through TSA, awaiting zone to be called when I hear announcement in gate area “Those of you carrying any carry on’s will be checked on your ticket to confirm you are allowed to carry a bag on our airline.” A standard size carry on to be placed in the overhead bin the day of travel at the airport of your departure, 50 bucks, but wait, there’s more! So a standard size carry on 14 x 9 x 22. A checked bag the day of travel at the airport of your departure, 50 bucks, not weighing more than 40 lbs and a maximum size of 80 linear inches (H + W + D). A 40 lb bag vs a light 15 pound bag, literally dropping off before the TSA screening vs carrying onto the plane is the same cost. Well as I’m one of the last several people to board the plane, spot several empty seats. As to not be a jerk to the 2 people that are seated and to make them get up and move, so I can grab a window seat, I say “That’s alright, no worries, I’ll just hop in a seat over here.” No, I’m told not until we are in the air, only when the seatbelt sign has been turned off by a stern flight attendant.” Lady from NY that is seated next to me says, we would have chosen different seats elsewhere, but it would’ve been an extra 40 bucks (20 each) to choose. At this point I’m doing the math in my head and am just glad the plane is leaving on time and we’re in the air. So I go to the iPad and begin to watch some mindless Netflix. 45 minutes later, our snack / drink service comes around. Dehydrated from the early coffee and altitude, I ask for cup of ice water. “We have bottles for 2.00.” Oh, well then how about a ginger ale on ice? “Yes sir, that will also be 2.00” Ah, I see, no thanks, what about a bag of pretzels or nuts then? “Yes sir, 4.00”. I just laughed at that point and said, I’ll just wait until we land. Talk about a nickel and dime airline. Unbelievable. Worst experience I’ve ever encountered. The worst part as a consumer, make your policies known in large font on your home page before people decide to purchase “A good deal airfare ticket.” Wait, better not, your customer purchases would probably rapidly drop and your company would lose millions. What a racket. Never again Allegiant. Never again.",-1
2019-04-15,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Flint to Punta Gorda,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,4.0,3,attendants condescending and cold,False,"  Flint to Punta Gorda. This was my first time traveling Allegiant. I found several of their representatives, check in and flight attendants condescending and cold. I have a disability and needed assistance. One asked me several times if I was traveling with someone as it was not their job to provide me with assistance. Another gave me information that I knew was incorrect. The Punta Gorda airport boarding ramp is on the tarmac and steeply ramped to the plane door. I had to be placed in a wheelchair to board and deplane as my scooter could not handle the ramp. Those folks tried their best to accommodate me. I was not aware that there was a charge for all snacks and beverages. When asked what was complimentary, the response was Ice, did I want a glass? Overall, I think more emphasis needs to be given to customer service.",-1
2019-04-14,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Cincinnati,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3,stood in line for at least an hour,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Cincinnati. Let me just say its ridiculous that we cannot check in our luggage more than 2 hours ahead! They could have checked us in, let us go through customs and wait on other end of airport where there is plenty of restaurants and shopping. Seriously we stood in line for at least an hour before we could even get to the agent. Only to be turned away and told come 2 hours before.",-1
2019-04-13,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Louisville,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,poor customer service,True,"  This was my first time flying with Allegiant, as I usually fly with Southwest. I thought I would try this airline to return home from an unexpected short vacation to FL. My seat was 3D (a seat I had paid for), and I had a carry on bag. I attempted to put my bag in the overhead bin, but it was closed, and I was quickly corrected that those were reserved for rows 1 and 2 passengers and their items. The bins for the next several rows were full of other passenger's items, so I placed my carry on about 5 rows back in that bin. I was thinking how inconvenient this would be when I went to get off the plane, as I would have to backtrack to get my personal items. As rows 1 and 2 filled, the flight attendant opened those 2 overhead bins, and after there was no more traffic from passengers boarding the plane, I realized there was still plenty of space to put my small carry on bag right above my seat. As I got up and went several rows back to grab my bag and move it, the flight attendant quickly corrected me and told me they were still waiting on 1 more passenger and they may need that space. She was rude and loud. I told her if another passenger boarded and there was not room for my belongings, that I would move them again. She replied with another rude comment, rolled her eyes, and kept to herself. Another passenger never boarded. There would have been space for my belongings the entire time, as there should have been, because again, I paid for this seat, and I have just as much right as any other passenger to store my personal belongings near me. The FA was so rude that even the other passengers around me noticed, and were caught off guard by her attitude. When exiting the plane after landing in Louisville, I grabbed my carry on (which was now above me in the overhead bin due to me moving it), and watched as the FA said ""Thank you for flying with Allegiant, have a good day!"" to passengers exiting before me; when I exited, she didn't look at me, nor wish me a good day. Overall poor customer service.",-1
2019-04-09,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to Mesa,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,3,not adjustable and very uncomfortable,False,  I have now flown with Allegiant Air 4 times total and it is always the same little flight from Provo to Mesa and back again. For an hour flight it is ok to fly. The seats are not adjustable and very uncomfortable. The tray table on my last two flights is only as big as a cell phone. Why would they downgrade a tray table in a plane? For any flight longer than an hour I would never fly them. The only reason I do use them is because they are the only airline out of the airport closest to me.,1
2019-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Cancun,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,By far the worst airline,True,"  Indianapolis to Cancun. By far the worst airline we have ever used. Delays both there and back. One was a mechanical issue and they claimed the other was due to snow. Friends reported no snow/ice delay issue with another airline they used, and we saw no snow or ice when landing. In total we had almost 7 hours of delays. We had to take buses to the airplane to board from steps on the tarmac after our gate of departure was changed due to the airplane's late arrival The flight attendants were unfriendly on both flights. One of the flight attendants was asleep during part of the flight returning to Indianapolis. Another couple told us that the same attendant would not assist them in throwing away items when requested. All seats were of the same class, but the first few rows received a package of misc. snacks and the rest of the plane received none. Our friends were in one of the rows (5th) that did receive the package. They did pay the same price for their flight with no request or upgrade made. I would not recommend this airline to anyone and will not be using Allegiant in the future.",-1
2019-04-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Clearwater to Norfolk,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,2,rude and uncooperative,True, Clearwater to Norfolk. The staff at the Norfolk airport for Allegiant Air was absolutely wonderful. Being it was my first time flying with this airline I was very pleased. Sad to say that my returning flight wasn't as nice. The baggage check was rude and uncooperative. I had to pay 5 dollars for a boarding pass and she separated me and my wife even after asking to keep us together. Given the fact that the couple before us got asked where did they want to sit and that it's up to their discretion to let people sit together if the plane isn't full. I had to pay for one of my bags and that was fifty dollars. But because my bag was five pounds over they was trying to charge me fifty more dollars. Then I found out that the scales was off because she said I was fine then after taking it off the scales to close it she put it back on the scales the weight was off. Then when trying to board the plane the lady told me I could have my carry-on bag because I am military but when I get to the lady at the door she wouldn't let me on. I told her I was military and she was extremely rude and told me to get out of line. Then I see another after I tried to talk to her again she just dismissed me like I wasn't even there. So when I see another milyguy get on the plane with a roll on I brought it to her attention and she told me because he was military with hostility like I was getting on her nerves. Once again I stated and other people started stating the same thing is when she finally let me on stating I never showed her my ID. When she never gave me a chance to. It's sad to say that I don't see myself or my family using this airline again.,-1

2019-03-27,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Peoria to Punta Gorda,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,cheaper than others,False,"  Peoria to Punta Gorda. Our plane was new and clean. The staff was very friendly. Our flight actually left 15 minutes early. This airline charges extra for luggage, but still was cheaper than others. You don’t have to pay extra for your seat and can do this at check in for free.",1

Second, my window seat I paid extra for was taken and flight attendant asked me to sit in an open middle seat. I waited over an hour after getting off plane for bags to come. When they did arrive, my new suitcase had a large dent in the top corner. Very bad first experience with allegiant.",-1
2019-03-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst customer service,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis. Absolute worst customer service I’ve ever seen! Not sure they even understand the meaning. I waited in a line of 100+ people for nearly an hour and a half. Then when I got up to the front I was told to get out of the line because it was exactly 2 hrs from my flight. Everything was paid for, we already had our boarding passes, literally just needed to hand them our bag and go to our gate. The attendant still told us we had to wait another hour. I’m tried to explain that we’ve been in line over a hour and a half and in that time, the line had only gotten longer and more disorganized. The attendant still told us to go to the back of the line. We booked these flights because they were a bit cheaper, but honestly if I knew what I do now, I would happily paid the extra money for an airline that has their stuff in order. This experience has been horrible - they (as a team) give absolutely zero about how they’re making their (paying) customers feel.",-1
2019-03-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Las Vegas to Fargo, North Dakota",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst customer service ever,True," My trip with Allegiant Air was the worst trip of my life. I rate this airline 1 out of 5. My flight for Wednesday was cancelled. When I talked with them at the airport they said that I had to call customer service. They cannot do anything. Customer service put me on hold for 4 hours to reschedule my flight. Worst customer service ever. When I talked with them, they say that they can put me on flight which is three days later (Saturday). So, they put me on flight for tomorrow to a different destination (Fargo, North Dakota) which is a four hour drive away from my destination (Sioux Falls). I had to make travel arrangements to my destination on my own. Further, they didn't even provide me any compensation for my accommodation and food. I had to stay in hotel in Vegas and pay for food on my own on Wednesday. I reached Fargo the next day around 8 pm. I couldn't get a flight at that time. So, I had stay in a hotel that day also. So, I reached my destination the following day. In short, I was supposed to reach to my destination on Wednesday. But thanks to Allegiant Air, I arrived home on Friday. I was on the way for three days.",-1
2019-03-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to St Petersburg Clearwater,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never use Allegiant again,True,"  Made reservation from Syracuse NY to St Petersburg/Clearwater International on Feb 19th, to fly out on Feb 22nd for a family emergency with a car rental. The car rental did not register correctly. Needed to call Allegiant customer service. On hold over a hour to make update. Arrived in St Petersburg/Clearwater and picked up Alamo car rental. The next day I went back to Alamo to see if I would have a problem returning the vehicle and the representative said no and that I would only be charged for the one day I had the car rental. The Alamo representative asked me for my credit card and that I would only be charged for 1 day. I kept checking my credit card and did not see a credit so I called Alamo on March 14th and was told that I needed to call Allegiant. I called Allegiant customer service and was on hold for over 1 and 1/2 hour to be told that any package deal was refundable. I told Allegiant representative I was told by the Alamo representative I would have not problem returning the vehicle and was only going to be charged for 1 day and the representative said that the Alamo representatives do not know the contract that is between Allegiant and Alamo. Do not get a car rental or a hotel together with Allegiant. I would have never returned the vehicle I the representative would have told me I would not be refunded any money. I also paid over $141 in taxes and fees to Alamo for the one day having the rental on top of paying for an entire weeks rental that I would not have returned if I had been told that I would have not been refunded the money from the unused time. I will never use Allegiant again nor will any of my family members or friends.",-1

Both trips were very good. On my latest trip, all Allegiant staff that I encountered were professional and friendly. I had the same captain on both flights and he was very friendly and even walked through the cabin to introduce himself to the passengers. Both flights were in time even though we had a gate change on the return flight. The seats were not comfortable, but for the price and experience, I will definitely use them again.",1

I checked his car seat at the gate in Niagara Falls. When I arrived in Florida, there was loose pieces of someone else’s car seat in my seat. The base of my seat was broken into 3 pieces and the large piece was never found. I have given them proof and purchase price and date. $400.00 and it was 5 months old. They are offering me $80.00. That won’t even cover half of a new base. When I landed in Florida it took 1.5 hours to even get someone to actually help me and not just pass me off to someone else.

2019-03-05,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Orlando,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,5,experience was absolutely wonderful,True,"  It was my first time flying ever. I had no idea what to expect. I had done my own research on Allegiant and have seen a lot of bad things and not a lot of good. My experience was absolutely wonderful. Flights both ways were on time, staff were all very kind, and even though the plane was full both ways it wasn’t overwhelming. Plus the price to fly was 70 dollars both ways that’s amazing. Will definitely fly with Allegiant again in the future.",1
2019-03-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,Customer service was zero,False," Booked our direct flight from Indianapolis to Orlando for a short vacation. Read the reviews and thought a delay would be the worst we would encounter since there were no layovers. Day prior to flying out, I received a call that our flight has already been delayed an entire 6 hours! That took away one full day by the time we arrived. Couldn’t imagine that it would get worse but of course it did. Arrive for our return flight and all appears on track to leave at the correct time. Then the delays started rolling in. First delay was for 30 minutes. Second delay pushed it back another hour. This continues until we are 4 hours past our departure time. Still all good long as we make it back (my girlfriend had an important meeting the following evening). Then the cancellation happened. Huge problem a stranding 100+ people with no option out until the following night at 6pm (30 hours after our selected departure time)! Immediately called customer service (as the line for the onsite crew ran into the food court). Customer service was zero help aside from reimbursing us for that leg of the trip. Found out from customs service the initial reason for the cancellation was due to weather. How is that possible when I’m looking at the weather in both locations and it looks impossible to be due to weather conditions. Upon mentioning that, customer service then stated it wasn’t actually due to weather but mechanical issues (found out later that this has been a huge problem with many Allegiant planes). No help finding flights out. No help finding hotel accommodations. No help in any way. I totally understand there is a limit to the help someone can provide over the phone but it came across like I knew more about the flight statuses and options going near our return location than customer support searching through their system. As all flights canceled one by one that were going to our home state, we resigned to the fact we’re going to need a place to stay or book another flight from Orlando. They literally expected everyone to crash in the airport or scramble to book a last minute flight for that evening or the following day. With a limited number of options to get back in time, we booked the last two seats on a flight that cost a whopping $2,200 total. Made it home 10 hours later than expected and exhausted from all the travel hassle. Lesson learned here. Never flying Allegiant Air again.",-1
2019-03-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Norfolk,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,The worst experience,False,  The worst experience. I will Never fly again with this airline from the beginning customer service was aweful there are too many hidden charges thAt are not told to you in the beginning and the staff was the worst in informing you when you asked questions. I was charged $100 for a carry on $50 each way I asked the rep first off why didn’t the lady in the front inform me of a charge when I got my boarding pass which cost me $5.00. Then to begin boarding the plane I’m informed my bag is $50 then told we are charging you a $100 what the hell. Misleading a fair that was $130 turned to $265 it’s not the money it’s the misrepresentation and then only being told it’s on the website No one books a ticket reading a websites total disgrace to the airline industry.,-1

The Allegiant staff at Punta Gorda were amazing, very polite and professional. Didn’t meet a rude person at all. The flight attendants went above and beyond! and added humor to our flight.

Arrived two and a half hours early for flight and was told I couldn't check my luggage in now as they were still handling an earlier flight.

2019-02-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sioux Falls to Sanford,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,One of the worst experiences,True,  Sioux Falls to Sanford. One of the worst experiences of my life! So they have been booking flights that get in so late that all the rental car places are closed. So I couldn't go on the trip because of this and they wouldn't credit my money back. Pretty shady if you ask me! They should know that the rental car places may be closed and post that when booking tickets. Had I known that I wouldn't have booked the flight at all. I'm out $385 now cause of it. Also they do charge extra for everything too. Even carry on bags are extra. Nothing is noted about this either. I had to add them for an additional $80 then right after that that's when I went to add a rental car and little did I know not only their affiliate car rental places were closed by the time the flight got in but all the rental car places were closed so the tickets were completely useless cause of that. There's not even a hotel around that airport either so yeah after hours of being on the phone with countless reps and disputing the charges with my credit card company I'm still stuck with the charges cause of the non refundable BS they have even though I cancelled with plenty of time for them to resell the seats. They didn't even try to though cause I kept getting email updates on the flight that I cancelled. I highly suggest pay a little more and use a better airline that doesn't charge extra for things that should be included and they would actually help you out if you need a rental car and that isn't shady about it.,-1

This is one of the worst airlines on the planet. Bought a round trip ticket for my daughter and they canceled her flight a couple of hours before it was schedule to take off. Went on their app to cancel the coming home flight and it ended up cancelling the whole trip. Now we are stuck with my daughter who doesn't have a flight back to school. Called customer support and this was another disaster. On hold for about an hour and finally got the rudest customer service agent which couldn't do anything to help. She said there was nothing we could do to get her flight back and if I wanted to get the same flight I had to pay double the price of the original ticket. I ended up getting another flight from Spirit. They didn't refund the whole amount for my tickets and short $26. I tried to call back and can't get through. Never again using them.,-1

We got to their ticket counter, within an hour of our flight, to check in and no one was there. The airport called over the intercom three times for an Allegiant rep to come down to help us. Finally, a rep comes down within 5 mins of our flight taking off and says she wouldn't open the ticket counter back up because the flight was already 80% full. Then, we called customer service for a refund. They would not give us a refund but would give us a credit with an $80 fee attached. Seriously, the worst airline service I've ever experienced. The absolute indifference the Allegiant rep showed to us was incredibly telling of how this airline treats their customers. Especially their military customers! I am stationed a few states away from my family and do not see them often. This was supposed to be a family trip and for everyone to see my 11 month old daughter (that most of my family hasn't met yet) however, now isn't happening because the ticket agent wouldn't open up the ticket counter ""because they are 80% full."" This airline might be affordable but you are getting what you pay for.",-1

Just an FYI to anyone checking a bag - make sure you read the fine print and understand that this cheap company has you paying $50, $25 online per 40lbs, unlike every other airline who lets you have 50lbs. Fun little trick/scam that they have so that you’re forced to spend an extra $50 on top of what you already paid at the counter - so now I’m paying more ($150) rountrip to get my bag in the air than myself.

I was on a direct flight on a Friday afternoon and my luggage was lost. It went to Savanna instead of Phoenix. I completed a lost luggage claim. The baggage handlers in Savanna knew they had a errant piece of luggage but did nothing to attempt to get it to the correct location. Allegiant’s policy states they will contact the passenger in 24 hours to inform them of the location of the luggage but by Monday afternoon I had still not heard from them. I finally received word that I would receive my luggage in Arizona Wednesday night, but I return to Cincinnati Wednesday morning! Now I will not get my luggage until February 4th-10 days after my departure! Terrible baggage policies and extremely poor customer service.",-1
2019-01-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Orlando,,,,,,,1,changed our flight time,False,"  Allegiant notified us nine days before flying that they had changed our flight time to six hours later in the day, effectively cutting a half-day off of our vacation. No explanation was given other than it was a ""market decision"". This caused issues with our booked accommodations and in meeting up with another couple. The solutions offered involved either driving 2/2.5 hours to fly out of another city (and the accompanying cost of a rental car and overnight hotel), fly four days earlier (sooner than our accommodations reservation) or, cancel our reservation which was made in early December and try and re-book on another airline. None of these were acceptable so we were forced to cancel and re-book at a cost $220 higher than our Allegiant tickets. We had flown Allegiant before without a problem, but, this ridiculous situation will likely mean we would no longer even consider flying Allegiant. We last flew Allegiant in either 2016 or 2017.",-1

Indianapolis to St. Petersburg. Overall very low budget airline and you get what you pay for with this company. Understand you are getting a very cheap flight to your destination with no frills or thrills and limited functionality from other airlines. No WiFi and they nickel and dime you to death.

It's been over two weeks and Allegiant still has not given us a full refund. Keeping monies paid for a product/service you don't provide is unethical and illegal.

From check-in to luggage retrieval, everything was perfect. The staff at the check-in counters at both airports were friendly and efficient. I think I spent two minutes, maximum, at each counter dropping off my bag, but I didn't feel rushed. Both flights left and arrived on time, and my luggage was available quickly. I felt like the website was very clear on the prices, and the airline sent multiple reminders to pay my baggage fees prior to arriving at the airport. I sat in an exit row on both flights, and checked a bag, and still paid significantly less than I would have flying any other airline, and I didn't have to go through Portland or Seattle, as I typically do to fly to Medford. I'm very happy with everything about this trip.",1
2019-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Rochester,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,won't be flying them again!,False,"  ""Ma'am - I really don't care if you fly Allegiant"" - Punta Gorda gate agent Jan 2, 2019. The gate agent for our flight (1596) today - Jan 2, 2019 was quite possibly the worst I have ever dealt with in my flying history. I've flown all over the world and our family flies every 4-6 weeks - mostly frequently between Rochester NY and Southwest Florida. Until this past year I refused to fly Allegiant due to their bad on-time and service record but heard through friends that it wasn't too bad and have since flown with them 8 times. Today - the gate agent in Punta Gorda went out of her way to be nasty. I realize that, for the most part, you get what you pay for. This is why I always pay for upgraded seats (meaning we sit forward in seating position - not to be confused with better, bigger seats - because they are not. Not a problem. I know that and do not expect bigger better seats - still I pay more). In all of the previous flights, prior to today, I have traveled with the same luggage that I carried on today. As we approached the gate agent rudely told us to get out of line and stand aside as we needed to pay for a carry on. I told her I had flown with the bag, never having paid before, her response was ""Well Today YOU DO."" We watched many others board with the same or larger bags, before my husband approached and said  ""these people have the same size bag, why are they not paying?"" She then looked for a passenger with a bag, took his phone from him and tried showing it to us. It was awkward and extremely unprofessional. When the rest of the plane had boarded and she was finally ready to ""deal"" with us and another passenger, she turned to us and said the bags we were boarding with had to be paid for. I  tried to explain once again that we had boarded the flight to PGD without incident, as well as many other Allegiant flights with the same bag. She could not have been ruder as she turned back and said that all of the of the other gate agents are not paying attention which, then, makes her job that much harder. At this point, I turned to my husband and said if this is the way Allegiant is going to treat people, we won't fly with them in the future. Having overheard my comment to my husband, the gate agent then addresses me and says ""Ma'am I really don't care! Thousands of people will."" WOW - through this whole ordeal I was thinking...it takes just as much energy to be nice as it does to be nasty - Yet she chose to be as snarky and rude as she could possibly be. I paid for a checked baggage, paid for seats, paid for my pet to fly - obviously I would have paid for a carry on bag if I had realized the necessity. This flight did change my opinion of Allegiant Air, what if the pilot and crew on board had the same ""Ma'am I really don't care attitude""? We won't be flying them again!",-1

We did not know what to do so we Decided to head to the airport. We were placed On an alternative flight which at least put us In our own state- then had to rent a car and drive home 4 hours after only 2 hours of sleep. Poor customer service or lack thereof. Since we took an alternate flight they “cannot help us Further”. They didn’t help at all to Begin with! It was a very stressful situation. The only way I was able to reach someone about my concern was via private fb message On their fb page. But they do not tell anyone this is an option- The options for getting ahold of someone That they provide are useless. Avoid this airline at all costs or you may miss your destination. And you will get zero help resolving your issue. Not worth saving a few hundred bucks. The flight attendants were very nice- not their fault- it’s the company that has poor customer service policies.",-1

Booked a flight to Orlando, Florida with months in advance and the airline decided to cancel the flight hours before! Not even to reschedule for a later time or for the next day. Just cancelled. Why? “due to weather” when there are no blizzards in either area or thunderstorms. Very disappointed with their customer service and lack of accommodation. Not only did we lose out on that, but the hotel reservations and 4 day theme park tickets and reservations to restaurants. Their response and a way of apologizing was “we’re sorry for the inconvenience, there's nothing else we can do for you”.",-1

Flying Allegiant should be the last option unless you are just looking for a cheap flight. You're not allowed anything free to drink including water unless you pay on the flight (but I was told I can get a cup of ice and wait for it to melt). Seats don't recline. Takes at least 45 minutes to get anyone on the phone for customer service. Once I was at the gate for departure and they told me I hadn't been checked in, even though I had their desk. Very rigid rules. The baggage restrictions are similar to other airlines as far as the maximum inches (H+W+L).. however if you're carrying on the plane, they want you to fit your carry-on in this skinny metal stand and if it doesn't fit they will charge a $50 fee. I was surprised because I had a piece of luggage that fit the maximum inches but because it didn't fit inside this skinny stand they made me pay and wouldn't refund my carry-on fee I paid for. Truth is if my carry-on was completely empty there was no way it would have fit, or anyone else's. I was shocked at how skinny it has to be. Also as I got on the plane, I counted about 14 other bags that were my exact size luggage that weren't asked to fit in their carry-on checking metal stand. Allegiant has been such a hassle.",-1

I am a customer who flies quite frequently for work and personal life. I have two emotional support dogs that I have had for 10 years and I have flown with them on many airlines including Allegiant before with no trouble. I purchased a ticket in September to fly home and surprise my family in Cincinnati for Christmas. I received an email from Allegiant in November, 2 months after I bought my ticket, saying that the emotional support policy had changed. I downloaded the documents that they told me I had to have it cost me $220 to get health certificates for both my ESA dogs. I showed up at the airport with my letter a form they made my doctor fill out, my ESA forms that cost me 220 and I checked in at the ticket counter. she said everything was fine. I go up and wait for an hour and a half at the gate nobody says anything to me. I go to check in for the flight and the worst customer service employee ever says to me I have removed you from this flight we’re getting your bags removed from the plane you’re only allowed to have one ESA dog. I was shocked and I said what and she said you have been removed from the flight step aside. that was it so when I tried to get information she just kept saying you’re only allowed one is a dog and I said I flew Allegiant in June and we were allowed to have two. I’ve never had a problem and she said the policy change December 10. She spoke to me so horribly and I already suffer from crippling anxiety which is why I have the ESA dogs, I started to panic and hyperventilate and cry uncontrollably so bad that other customers were trying to help me and she was telling them to shut up that she didn’t have to talk to them. She was so cold never offered any assistance as to what I could do to fix it she just kept saying you’re off this flight. I asked her if I could pay for a second animal and put them in the carrier and she yelled at me where you going to get a carrier!? I told her I had one in my luggage and she said you’re off this flight. when other customers ask for a supervisor she said there was none. A lady that was on my flight Looked online and said your policy says you can have two dogs. She responded that’s for normal inflight people not people with disabilities and ESA dogs. Why would people just flying be allowed more courtesy and then people with disabilities flying? And why would a customer service agent go out of her way to not help someone or give them any options or any comfort in a terrible situation? Other customers were trying to offer to put my dog in their bag and she just kept telling all of them to shut up she didn’t have to talk to them. I’ve never experienced anything like it do not ever fly Allegiant ever it’s horrible. Why would people just flying be allowed more courtesy and then people with disabilities flying?

First i would like to say the app and update notifications are great. Nothing about the airline is a problem up until you actually get there. Yes we are aware that its a smaller hub with cheaper flights (unless you check bags etc) so there are things you have to just understand and go with the flow about the process. However, whenever I get to the airport blatantly frantic and apologetic knowing I'm running late but have just enough time to make my flight, the last thing someone in my position wants to hear is ""yep, you're not gonna make it. You might as well not even try. Your bags not gonna make it either. Go talk to the lay at the end"" I was given attitude by the check in lady along with the lady once I made it to my gate (I would like it to be known i in fact did make my flight and got to my destination even after being held at the check in desk for an unnecessary amount of time). I'd like to point out to the employees that nobody chooses or wants to be late for a flight to see their family. You don't know what happened before getting to the airport that made them late. That being said, your attitude is the last thing we need to hear during that stressful time. The customer service experience alone makes it not with the potential savings in money for the flight.",-1

We flew down to AZ to close up my in-laws house (who both passed away this summer) and were planning to return on Allegiant, but our plans changed when we couldn't sell my in-laws vehicle and had to drive back to MN from AZ. We cancelled the return flight, hotel, and car rental two days early, but had to forfeit the entire cost and we were not given any refunds. We ended up paying for two nights at the hotel and two days of the car rental that went un-used. We also had to forfeit the airfare for the return trip - all told about $700 that was forfeited. I understand that we might take a hit on cancelling the return flight, but I don't understand why we also lost the hotel and car rental fees. I'm sure the hotel was able to re-book our room for the two nights. Buyer beware if you plan to book using the all-in-one ""convenience"" with Allegiant Air, and don't pay the extra $75 insurance fee for the opportunity to cancel your flight.",-1

She did this in front of all the other passengers. She was also doing this to other passengers.  She was rude and disrespectful.

Flew out to LA for a weekend, our returning flight was cancelled without reschedule. We were left stranded in LAX with nowhere to go except spend $1000 per person x6 to get a one way home. This was on a Sunday, we were not given any alternative options. The airline posted a delay for 2 hours, after 2.5 hours we were one of two that received an automated call saying the flight was cancelled. Only 2 people out of an entire plane were notified. The attendants wouldn’t even tell us! When asked what we could do they offered to book us on the Thursday flight, leaving us to pay for everything for 5 days without reimbursement and they also couldn’t guarantee the flight! There were so many families on the plane stranded without any money or the ability to do anything at all and the airlines wasn’t accommodating or helpful in the least. It was so sad to watch these people scramble to figure out what to do. Many of which were left in huge financial distress because they had no other option! It disgusting that an airline is allowed to operate under this lack of service and zero federal regulations. We had to purchase astronomical one way tickets to the closest airport and rent a car home on our own dime without any offer of help. It’s disgusting. Allegiant Air should be held accountable.  No one should pay their hard earned money for a service and be left stranded without a way out! It’s absolutely despicable.",-1

After waiting on hold for almost 45 minutes and having to call several times to actually speak to a person I was told the only option was reimbursement for the flight (which would take us off the flight plan) or they could put us on a flight in Grand Island as long as we were willing to drive there. This would have been ok accept the flight left in 2 hours and the drive was just over two hours leaving us with no options even after asking for any kind of connecting flight. A friend of ours who would have been on the same flight received a $100 voucher for the flight being delayed and was reimbursed for the hotel she was unable to make it to, but we were not given the same treatment. I asked if we would be compensated for the inconvenience but was told there was ""simply nothing we can do"" and they would not reimburse us for our hotel because we did not book the hotel through their website because they were ""not responsible"" even though the only reason we didn't get to the hotel was because of the airline leaving them at fault. All together the airline did nothing for our inconvenience and the representative I spoke to made no attempt to help with our situation. My wife and I will not be using this airline again.",-1

This is hands down one of the absolute worst travel experiences I’ve had with the worst airline company I’ve ever dealt with. We are very unhappy and displeased & this is not our first issue with Allegiant. I am very upset with this company & bothered from start to finish!! They have lost many customers (myself, my family and friends) from this situation & their lack of help/response. We were at the airport & a very light snow flurry started that lasted less than 10 min. They tell us that there has to be a over ¼ of a mile visibility for the plane to land. Within a few minutes of the storm hitting we could see to the lake which is about 1 mile away. They then told us that the “plane does not have enough gas to circle while waiting for weather” They said that the plane had to fly back to Mesa (over an hr flight) to fuel up. We find this upsetting & hard to believe as the FAA has very specific rules and guidelines about how much gas a plane has to have. They should have had enough to circle & wait for the short flurry to pass. I have been on planes before that circled for 30 or more minutes before turning to go somewhere else. Even had a plane turn back around and land where we were supposed to after circling and waiting. So this is completely unacceptable! We are then told it will be a 2 hr delay (in the worst, most uncomfortable and claustrophobic airport I’ve been in) so they can go fill up the plane. This is upsetting & frustrating but we can handle a 2 hr delay. Shortly after this we are told that it would be even more delayed further into the evening causing a 10 hour delay. They said that they did not have snow removal equipment at the airport so the plane can’t come back. How does an airport in Utah not have snow removal equipment? It snows there half the year but they don’t have the equipment!! But then we see a snow plow in the parking lot.. All of this is completely uncalled for, unnecessary and ridiculous. If we had been in the Salt Lake airport we would have taken off and been in our destination on time. We had to pay for an uber to get us to and from the airport which cost us even more money. Thankfully we live within 30 min of the airport. When we got back to the airport there is another delay! The incoming plane doesn’t land until it is almost time for our flight to take off. They finally load the plane and we sit on the tarmac for an extended period of time waiting without any reason, they never told us why we weren’t taking off. Once we land we then sit on the tarmac again, once again with no explanation. When we were on the plane we were not offered anything as an apology, no free snacks or drinks from the over priced selection. Staff did not seem apologetic for the issues or problems with the flights! Our entire first day of the trip was completely gone and ruined!  I have been trying to contact customer service since this all happened. I have emailed a few times with no response. I spent about 4 hours trying to call Allegiant today to no avail.",-1
2018-12-10,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Asheville,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,5,not had a problem with them,False,"  I have flown with Allegiant Airlines several times over the past few months and not had a problem with them. They get me to the destination I need to go, and no issues with check in or boarding. They may not serve any complimentary drinks or snacks unless you buy it but that doesn’t matter to me since the flights I’ve been taking are only about an hour and a half long. I also had my flight canceled recently due to bad weather but I called to reschedule my flight for another day and their customer service was efficient and great, and made the rescheduling very easy. I would recommend flying with Allegiant, especially for shorter distance flights. I’ll definitely be flying with them again in the future.",1
2018-12-03,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boise to Mesa,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5,relatively pleasant flights,True,"  I have used Allegiant Air two times over the last few months. Once from Boise to Las Vegas and from Boise to Mesa. Both times I was on an Airbus A320 and had relatively pleasant flights. Service was easy and the people at the desk in the airports and customer service (phone) were friendly and helpful. The only drawbacks from my experience were the customer service phone wait time (over an hour) and paying for a carry on. However, on my second flight after a little more research I found that Veterans get free checked bags and carry ons which was very cool. My flights were short (under 2 hours) so the snack situation was not an issue. Big point is if you do your research and read the info provided by them then you should have no complaints. I've seen too many bad reviews where people complain about stuff they would have known if they researched and read what was provided to them. Those reviews make me laugh and are unhelpful to say the least and I give them an unhelpful vote whenever I can. I wholeheartedly would recommend Allegiant and will happily fly them again.",1
2018-12-03,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Bellingham,2.0,,2.0,,,4.0,3,treated so unprofessionally,True,"  Oakland to Bellingham. The flight associate at the ticket counter at Oakland airport was very rude. As I got in the line, one associate was already yelling at another customer who had issues with his carryon bag, he was treated so badly and was threatened with security. Then came my turn when a different associate half sleepy (6am) doesn’t even greet and was damn rude about my bag being 5 pounds overweight, I said I will take out items and balance it out, she just stood there yawning and making rude comments while I was balancing the weight. I asked her if she was having a bad morning and she said no I’m having fantastic morning. Never ever in my life have I been treated so unprofessionally at an airline ticket counter. I will think twice next time flying this airline.",-1
2018-11-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando Sanford to Tri State Milton,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never use Allegiant Air again,True,"  Orlando Sanford to Tri State Milton. I will never use Allegiant Air again or recommend them. They charged me for 2 people when it should have been 1 on a trip from FL to VA. I tried to call them but no one ever actually answers the phones, so I could not see for sure of the double charge till I received my monthly credit card bill. I emailed them to ask for a correction and a refund, had to wait a long time for their response and was basically told too bad, so sad, no refund for you! I will never use their services again. I was double charged because of a mistake due to their part and left feeling angry and disgusted. Horrible Customer Relations and Service.",-1

2018-11-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Nashville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I definitely don't recommend,True,"  Richmond to Nashville. Arrived 75 minutes prior to our flight departure from RIC, which is a small airport (2 terminals). Had to wait in line 50 minutes to drop off our checked bag after mobile check-in. Mobile check-in wasn’t working and people were being returned from security because passes weren’t being accepted. 1 person working behind ticket counter to process the entire flight! Working the final 7 people in line, she calls the gate (in front of me) to let them know how many people are left and that she’s working us thru and we will make the flight. Got thru security and to the gate only to find the pilot “made the decision” to depart on time and leave passengers standing at the gate. No luggage because it was already on the plane. No additional flight because there’s only 1 per day. Sit on hold 70 minutes to get a representative who re-books on different airline, for 10pm that night. Their flight was then delayed until the next day, so a hotel stay and nearly 24hrs later, we leave for our trip. Was told by Allegiant they were short-staffed that day which caused a disruption. The pilot was more concerned with leaving on-time than taking care of the customer. It’s beyond comprehension they could not wait an additional few minutes for the rest of the passengers to clear security since they only offger 1 flight every 3 days? So this “economy flight” ultimately cost more than traveling a normal airline, caused a lot of additional stress because of very little customer service, and ruined the first-time flight experience for a little girl. I definitely don't recommend.",-1
2018-11-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Indianapolis,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,just one minute late,True,"  Charleston to Indianapolis. Ineptness begins with their phone service. Either you get put on hold for hours or reach travel agents from India. The next thing is their manipulative and deceptivity at their ticket counters where, if you are just one minute late, they aren’t there. Then there is their pettiness, where they get back at their distraught customers for yelling by not applying the refunds they had previously agreed to, the biggest all around assessment is their ineptness, so be glad if you miss your flight or something.",-1

Delayed our flight for 4 hours so it was past midnight. They never explained the reason for the delay, and then when boarded the plane one of the engines went out so we got stuck for another couple of hours. This airline never seems to be on time. Its not that cheap compared to other airline and I regret getting its credit card. will use it to buy American Airlines tickets instead, at least much more reliable",-1

2018-11-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Ogden,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,copy of their birth certificate,True,"  I love Allegiant's price, but when it comes to flying with children it is the worst. If you are flying with a child that is 2 or under on your lap you have to have a hard copy of their birth certificate which I think is the dumbest thing. If you don’t have one then they will make you buy a ticket for that child or you can’t fly. With all other airlines you just need a picture which makes my life a whole lot easier and less stressful, plus I don’t want to fly with my child’s hard copy because it could get damaged or even lost.",-1
2018-11-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fargo to Arizona,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,so disappointed with Allegiant Air,True," I am very disappointed in Allegiant Air. I find that they are very greedy in wanting to charge every little thing. My husband and I are traveling to Arizona for a little vacation and booked our flights weeks ahead of time. There are plenty of seats left on the plane. I have never had this ever happen to me when we book together. We don’t care if we sit up front or in the back. Usually when you book together, you get seated together. Unless, it’s a full flight then I understand why seats are needed to be bought. Needless to say, it is not a full flight. We are traveling with an infant and of course they see that and had to split us up knowing we would have to pay to sit together. Like I said, never had this ever happen to us with any airline. There were plenty of open seats left when we called and they said it was a 50/50 chance. Well what are the odds of them splitting a family. All they said was if we put the infant with one adult. Well no duh. Of course our son had to be with one adult. I can’t inagine why they would split him up too. And he was a lap seat. So he wouldn’t be needing to split up. Allegiant Air customer service was not helpful or great but of course we had to pay to get our seat changed knowing there’s other seats available. It’s definitely a tactic strategy that they had to do to charge for every little thing. Other airlines would have never had this happen. I am so disappointed with Allegiant Air. Will never fly with them again.",-1
2018-10-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Little Rock,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst experience ever,True,  Orlando to Little Rock. Worst experience ever. All passengers had to deplane due to “paperwork” screw up. Flight was several hours late. Had to sit on the new plane for an hour on the runway after having to change gates. It was mass confusion and they didnt know what was going on.,-1
2018-10-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sanford to Concord,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,2,never fly Allegiant again,True,"  I was on flight 2138 yesterday with ""nonstop service"" from Orlando Sanford to Concord NC. Our flight was initially delayed for ""mechanical issues"". We boarded, were then deplaned (still in Sanford) and loaded up onto another plane. When we descended into Concord, our pilot had to pull up abruptly two times because of missed approaches. This scared many people on the plane, but that's not the worst part. Many people on the plane had family members on the ground who were waiting for their arrival. We were told since our pilot couldn't land us, Allegiant instructed him to return to Sanford. Everyone was disappointed by that decision, considering there were dozens of closer airports to divert to. On our way back to Sanford, we were told we would stop in Savannah to refuel. While we were stretching our legs on the jet bridge, we were told we would attempt Concord again. A few moments later, we were told the jetbridge hit the door of the plane and we would be grounded until further notice. Remember those people sitting at the airport in Concord waiting for their loved ones? At this point, most of them finally had a chance to talk to their loved ones. While they were at the airport, Allegiant refused to give them any answers about what happened to the plane and why it didn't land. They hid from the terrified people who wondered why their loved ones' plane didn't land. When I finally called my mother from Savannah, she was hysterically crying and told me that her and three other people stood outside in the 46 degree rain to watch for the plane at the fence, when Allegiant couldn't give them any answers as to where it was. Was Allegiant scared to hint that their pilot was incompetent because other planes were landing safely at that time? Whatever it is, it's not fair what they put the people on the ground through yesterday. My flight was supposed to arrive at 2:29 PM and finally got in around 12:30 midnight. 10 hours late. The flight attendants did their best to accommodate passengers, however we were told we were only allowed one free snack and drink & the FA's were too flustered to accept payments. Many people missed lunch and dinner during this ordeal, including children, and the least Allegiant could do is offer up snacks to these people who were unable to eat meals. One flight attendant stood out from the rest and we could really tell she had the best intentions for everyone on that plane. She did the best she could to keep everyone comfortable, while still trying to follow Allegiant's stingy orders. All in all, this was my first flight experience with Allegiant. As a fairly frequent flyer with other airlines, I opted for Allegiant because the airport is small, convenient and only 5 minutes from my house. I understand that mechanical problems happen. I even get that the pilot didn't feel comfortable with landing the plane (maybe he needs to be trained better). What I can't forgive is the terrible communication from Allegiant to our loved ones on the ground and the bad call to ""send us back to Sanford"", where I'm sure you would have deplaned us & cancelled the flight, leaving us stranded. I literally could have driven from Orlando to Concord NC faster and made it there safer than I felt on your plane. Please use this as a learning opportunity because there were many people on our flight who swore to never fly Allegiant again.",-1
2018-10-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Grand Rapids,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely the worst,False,"  Orlando to Grand Rapids. Absolutely the worst. Lost one of our bags. No one from Allegiant was available anywhere to help us. The only representatives would be at the ticket counter and they are only there when checking in a departing flight. Calls to baggage customer service went to voicemail and their mailbox is full! Wait times for general customer service were 15+ minutes and we're futile. Absolutely no solutions! Airport guest services tried to get in touch with them, but basically gave the impression that this is a common occurrence with them. I don't understand how a company can operate this way.",-1
2018-10-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3,worst customer service,True,"  Bellingham to Las Vegas. The worst customer service ever. Cancelled the flight, even though other Allegiant flight took off. Refused to put us on that flight because they were not able to print the tickets. No apology, the supervisor didn't even show up. Gave a food voucher for $8. Don't take a chance to ruin your vacation.",-1
2018-10-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Destin,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,didn’t care and were not helpful,True,"  I bought 2 tickets from Austin to Destin along with a rental car. The flight was fine, but when we went to get our car that we had already paid for, they could not do it because we did not have a major credit card for the car to be rented. I asked the person I was with if we could put it under their MasterCard so It would be no big deal, but the car rental company would not let us. I called Allegiant and asked if they could switch the name on the reservation to the name on the credit card and they said no. There was nothing more to it, other than I had to eat the money I had already paid for a rental car on the reservation. They didn’t care and were not helpful that they had left me stranded at an airport. I’d pay the extra money for an airline that actually cares about its customers.",-1

Charged me $200 for a carry on bag, not check bag, carry on! Absolutely ridiculous. After my trip I called Allegiant Air and they were rude and did not help me at all. They do have cheap flights but they make up for it in the baggage fees and on flight beverages. The only flight I know of that will charge for a glass of water. I will never fly Allegiant again!",-1
2018-10-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Antonio,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,we ending up getting a sauna,False," Flight 2246 from Orlando to San Antonio, everything was ok and the flight was on time. The punishment started after they closed the door at 3.00 pm. The flight supposes to be for 3.12 pm. We was happy for going before the real departing time. We noticed the was no air conditioner running in the cabin. After they close the door the situations turned from bad to worst in a matter of minutes. My wife have a High Blood Pressure, I have to raise my voice to the flight attendant, he said ""all going to be OK, after we are moving on the runaway"" he was wrong dead, we move for minutes and stop again. The situation was boiling and everybody was complaining, finally some one notified the passengers that this flight will we delayed, no one say for how long. After been in this ""sauna"" for over a hour and half, finally this flight 2246 starting the runaway, but the air conditioner never came. From 530 pm, east time to the arrival in San Antonio there was not air at all. Many time we has flight with Allegiant Air, some time we have one or two delayed but never ever something like this. What is bother me is the miscommunication with the the passengers. Also the noise inside the cabin was so loud that we don't heard the instruction coming from the pilot. We paid for a flight and we ending up getting a ""sauna"" and the chamber of horror, we paid to get a comfortable flight and we ending getting a nightmare. I was there and many ""sauna passenger"" was saying ""this is the last time we will flight with Allegiant"". If the company do the thing the correct way I, am the first to complimented, but in this time I raise my voice to complaint, this is wrong and do not reflect the real value and the standards of this company.",1

Was meant to fly with Allegiant on Thursday but had to cancel my trip due to a family bereavement. Now most airlines and travel companies offer refunds for bereavements with an upload of death certificate. Not Allegiant. Upon closer inspection in there terms and conditions they do not offer refunds for bereavements to 'keep fares low'. Allegiant: At least have the courtesy to amend your terms and conditions to speak the truth and say 'we do not offer refunds on bereavements because we as a company have zero compassion and don't view flexibility for the bereaved as a decent thing to do. As a business we feel that maintaining our status as a budget airline is way more important than being decent human beings""",-1
2018-10-09,0.1,Business,Business Class,Des Moines to Las Vegas,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,I’m shocked right now,True,"  Des Moines to Las Vegas. I’m shocked right now. I feel like I should decompress and take a few days before writing a review but the threatening behavior and jokes made are far too unprofessional to not write about, immediately. I hope this review discourages people from flying with Allegiant Air. After the 4th person near me complained about the flight attendant, I figured screw it - she may be having a bad day or something because she was being so rude and short with customers, but I must file a complaint. I travel for a living and I’ve never experienced such obnoxious service. Well, anyway, I didn’t want to be confrontational so I asked her co-worker for her name. He flipped out on me. I went from filing a complaint to feeling like I was about to have to defend myself. The guy clearly works out with his physical shape so I’m assuming he had maybe, a steroid rage moment - but the conversation ended with him leaning toward my face in an aggressive manner saying “what, are you gunna do - you some kind of tough guy - I’ll make it so you never fly this airline again!” I simply responded with “Don’t worry, I will never fly this airline again.” Then he literally started to lip talking insults to me from 2 rows away. I was sitting in 4D so I was near the front where he was sitting. He was egging me on as if to provoke a fight. Just crazy. So unprofessional.",-1

2018-10-01,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Nashville,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,definitely fly Allegiant again,False,"  Richmond to Nashville. We flew out of RIC on Monday Sept 24, 2018. We were 45 mins late leaving, arrived 45 mins late in Nashville. This was not a big problem for us. We had read many bad reviews, so 45 mins late was ok. The crew were fine and courteous. The flight back to RIC on Friday, Sept 28, 2018 was fantastic. Left on time, arrived on time. Crew was again nice and courteous. I would definitely fly Allegiant again. I think some of the problems on the ground that people complain about are related to not having enough employees to work at the ticket counter, etc. But, that's also how they keep prices down. We were so happy that we had a good experience.",1
2018-09-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Nashville,,,,,,,1,policies extremely deceptive,True,"  Allegiant Air travel insurance and cancellation policies are extremely deceptive. You purchase these so changes or cancellations can be made without additional fees, right? But they don't inform you of the additional charges for cancellations. And that if you do it online you get a fee for that too. And they are a no refund company as well. So just kiss your money goodbye. We just won't go to how rude customer service is. So rude, would not let me speak, kept speaking over me.",-1
2018-09-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3,Do not use Allegiant,True,  Nashville to Myrtle Beach. I booked my flight in July not knowing that a catastrophic hurricane would hit the week before I fly. I called them to cancel letting them know I would not be able to even get out of the airport to go visit family in Lumberton NC because all the roads were either flooded or caving in. They showed no sympathy and said basically I’m outta luck and gave me a small credit for a future flight. So if this was my first flight with them what makes them think I would use them again. Do not use Allegiant Air.,-1
2018-09-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to New York,,,,,,,1,would not reimburse me,True,"  Myrtle Beach to New York. I live in Wilmington, NC and we were just hit by a catastrophic hurricane. All the roads are flooded and trees are down everywhere. I called Allegiant and Spirit Airlines as I will not be able to travel (my home was ruined by the storm) and all the roads out of town are flooded. Spirit understood that this is a natural disaster and reimbursed me the full amount of my flight. Allegiant would not reimburse me, they told me that they are not a company who reimburses. They would only give me a small credit for a future flight, not the actual price I paid ($160). I think this is a true reflection of the company. The customer service was horrible (waited over 30 minutes for a representative) and both the employee and their manager were extremely condescending.",-1
2018-09-12,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Eugene,5.0,,5.0,,,2.0,5,flight experience was awesome,False,"  Los Angeles to Eugene. This was my first time flying Allegiant, using them for the cheapest fare for a trip to Oregon from Sept 7-10 for our family of 4. I didn't think to look at reviews until the day before our departure and I was horrified by what I read. But I prayed hard and remained hopeful and our flight experience was awesome! On time departures on both ends. On time arrival on the front end and early arrival on the back end. First plane must have been new-so clean that it sparkled, no dust or grime or scratches or anything!  The plane on our return wasn't as immaculate but I would still consider it clean. Flight attendants friendly and I appreciated their diversity in age, look, size, etc. I chose to save money by not selecting seats in advance because I knew that our kids wouldn't be seated alone. It worked out great that my husband was seated near the kids and I got a break by sitting across the aisle or, even better, two rows behind on the flight back! I thought the seats were the most comfortable I've ever experienced, and I've been flying for almost 50 years, both domestic and internationally. I must admit that I'm 5'2"", not overweight, and prefer firm straight-back chairs which probably doesn't characterize most folks, but I loved the seating. There was enough wiggle room in the seat and in front for legs/feet. The guy next to me stretched his arms behind his head and there was enough room that I didn't get elbowed in the temple. The center aisle felt really spacious to me which is funny because I know it's not that wide but there was enough room to walk with bags and not bang into armrests or passengers knees. Customer service before the flight was totally lacking. Tried calling in July and no one ever answered. Emailed instead on July 20 and got a reply 3 weeks later on Aug 8 which said my concern about rental car timing was handled, only to find out the day before our trip that it wasn't fixed. Luckily, someone answered the customer service phone that day I called after 40min of wait time, and I got great service for that issue. Overall, I was pleased flying Allegiant and would use them again.",1

I fly Allegiant air quite frequently and am always disgusted by their flight attendants and staff. However, today I am beyond over them. I brought my liquids in the exact amount that is allowed on the plane from Phoenix to Montana there were absolutely no issues with the liquids. However today on the way back it is now against their policy. So I had to throw away over a $100 worth of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and other things you need on vacation. This is not my only issue they are always rude, absolutely nothing is free and everything is over priced. They talk to everyone like they are children and refuse to allow anyone switch seats because and I quote ""the plane has been weight calculated based on everyone sitting in their assigned seat."" I had to pay an extra $47 today in order for the three of us to sit next to each other! We bought our tickets together and we are traveling with my son. There is no reason that we should have to pay extra in order for us to sit next to each other! Good luck trying to switch seats. So you are forced to buy the seats. Cheap is proving to not be worth the constant headache.",-1

Did not offer to feed anyone with the long layover. Was told if we removed our luggage we would lose our ticket and money for the flights. After asking to deplane and then plane was ready to go it was then used to fly other passengers to Fort Lauderdale. As of 8.30 PM we still have not heard whether we get to travel or not.

On the last 5 times myself or a family member has flown Allegiant, the flight has been delayed at least 2 hours for mechanical problems.

2018-09-01,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Las Vegas,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,2,worst experience ever,True,"  Grand Rapids to Las Vegas. The worst experience ever. Our flight was over an hour delayed and there was no information available giving notice. The employee at the gate told everyone to follow her, then when we did she made us all turn around and told us we were going go all go to jail for trying to board the plane without getting our boarding pass scanned. I paid extra for priority boarding and extra leg room but if you are in an exit row, you are not allowed to board priority. Which we didn't know until we were trying to get on the plane. The plane itself was in need of updating and repairs. The carpet with coming up and the seats were stained. I called to talk to someone about the priority boarding situation and was told ""A supervisor is available to listen to your concern but cannot do anything about it so you will have to email the company."" After waiting on hold for 14 minutes. Worst. Experience. Ever. Oh! And we booked transportation from the airport to the hotel through allegiant which uses Bell's transportation and the bus broke down in the middle of the road and because we didn't book directly through bells, they will not refund our transportation fee.",-1
2018-09-01,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Cincinnati,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5,works great,True," Denver to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. Seemed fine, left on time, you can take a backpack ""for free."" Expect to pay $2 for a soda or what not on the plane if desired (though you can actually bring food from home or from the airport [except drinks, only from the airport] through security and onto the plane). Only bummer is having to pay extra to pick seats. But you might be able to work around it by paying for the seats ""at checkin time"" (i.e. online) so you only have to pay for reserved seating of 3/4 of them or what not, if all you care about is sitting together. So, basically if you have a flexible departure time frame and don't check bags, and don't need inflight entertainment, works great! They even let us have our 1.5 year old sit on ""mom's lap"" no problems.",1
2018-08-25,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Nashville to St. Petersburg,1.0,3.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,seats are the narrowest,True," Nashville to St. Petersburg. This was my first (and last) experience with Allegiant. The fare price was great but other than that there was not much good. When I arrived at the airport about 90 before the flight I received a text that my 12:44 pm flight was going to be delayed to 2:55 pm. Not a big deal but when I checked the board in the airport it still showed everything on time. I also got an email at this time with a $50 travel voucher from the airline. So I called home to let my wife know and told her to watch the flight so she could pick me up at the airport. At 1:41pm I got another text pushing the flight to 5:34 pm. Again, no update on the airport boards and apparently not on the internet either as my wife called when she was at the airport to pick me up and I answered the phone, still in Nashville! At around 4 pm someone with some customer service savvy brought pizza to the gate for everyone waiting. While all of this was going on the info board at the gate was out of service and there were no announcements from the gate agents who were sitting around in the wheel chairs at the gate. Finally, at around 5 pm we boarded the flight. Once loaded, the flight attendants and gate agents came through the plane at least 7 times by could not agree on a passenger count. I know this was the issue because I was sitting near the front and could hear everyone trying to blame each other for the issue. We sat on the plane until a little after 7 pm at the gate waiting for fuel and a good head count. We arrived in St. Pete at 9:36pm 9 hours late when I received a final text saying the flight was going to be delayed until 7 pm. At no time was an announcement made on board letting the passengers know what time we would be landing so we could notify people at the destination. The gate agents were nice but not communicative enough. When asked what the delay was I was told that a ""Rescue"" plane was being sent. That was alarming considering Allegiant's maintenance history. The plane was nice and I am sure that they have the widest aisles in the industry because I am also sure that the seats are the narrowest. I paid extra for more leg room but if the seat I got had more leg room I could not find it. Overall a horrible experience. I have well over 1,000,000 miles in the air and this was the worst!",-1
2018-08-23,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Concord to Punta Gorda,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,they don't have enough agents,True,"  Concord to Punta Gorda. I purchased a flight and added Flex Trip to my purchase. I went online to make a change to my departure flight from August 24th to Sept 7th. The amount to change my flight showed $0. When I went to add my seat assignment it stated that I owed $11. I already paid the same amount for my original seat assignment so I called their customer service team. I waited on hold for 50 min. The rep told me that the seat prices change daily. All I wanted was to sit in the same row and asked why I had to pay for my seat again. She told me that I was not paying for the seat I was paying for a change in my flight. She quoted that I would have to pay and extra $4. However, my flight change states that I have a zero charge, not to mention that I have Flex Trip and nowhere in their policy does it state that I have to pay again for my seat. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she refused. Stating a supervisor cannot help me. In summary, they don't have enough agents to answer the phones, they remind you of how you can go to their online portal to make changes yet the price they quote on the portal is higher than the price given by the agent, they do not honor their policy when purchasing flex trip and they refuse to provide you with a supervisor.",-1

This was the 1st time we had actually flown. I was very impressed with how smoothly things went. We arrived at the airport to park in the long term parking area, went right to baggage check in, went thru TSA and boarded the plane with no problems at all. The plane ride there and back was very smooth. I was concerned with the reviews regarding the seats and leg room, but this proved to be no problem at all. My husband is a big guy and had plenty of room. The seats could be a little more comfortable, but our flight was less then 2 hours so it wasn't an issue.",1

Even if I ignored the extra 110$ of which I ridiculously paid for for printing the boarding pass and and my carry on. All staff were rude and always looked for opportunity to add more charges to me. My conclusion is that I bought this flight because it was a little cheaper, but after the extra 110$ (on top of the 280$ I paid) it turned out it wasn't cheaper than the other companies. And now on top of this I was stuck with poor seats and service. By the way, they didn't even have space for my bag, so it's under my legs right now while writing this. Me or anybody I know will never fly with Allegiant again! Have a safe trip!",-1

Don’t ever give these people money you’ll hate yourself for it. I was stuck in a tiny airport with two gates for almost 7 hours because our flight was delayed due to maintenance. They shouldn’t even have the privilege to own an airline what a joke, kept telling us the plane was in the air and would be landing shortly, it went from 4:00pm to 9:30pm to 9:45pm to “its in the air” it’ll be here in 50 minutes then 50 minutes later they said it would arrive in 30 minutes and said that about 3 more times after that.

2018-08-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Columbus,,,,,,1.0,1,worst airline ever,True,"  Tampa to Columbus. Absolute worst airline ever I highly recommend you take your money else where they're nothing but a headache and very unorganized as a company I made it to the airport 1 hour and 10 minutes before my flight which left at 8am and I had downloaded the allegiant app as prompted on my itinerary and went to the front desk and they directed me to my gate once I made it to the TSA check in they were unable to scan the bar code off the app so I was told to go back the front desk so they can print me a copy of my boarding pass well once I got back to the front desk they told me it would be a 5 dollar charge to print and that they only accepted credit which I didn't have on me only had cash but he insisted that the app would work and to try again. I went back and again it didn't work and I even expressed how upset I was to the TSA attendant so he tried a few times for me and still nothing so again I go back to the counter because he suggested they could just use the card the flight was purchased with for the boarding pass well. I went over to the counter again and they scanned it just fine and claimed that if it worked at there desk then it would work at the check in so I took a screenshot of the barcode and zoomed in on it and it and it worked the third time finally and went through security. Even though all the running around it was still only 7:44 so I proceeded to my gate which was empty not a person in sight so I went to the next gate and asked where the flight to Columbus boarded and told me I had missed it, I asked how could that be it wasn't supposed to leave until 8 and she told me doors close 15 mins prior to departure and i looked at my phone 7:46 and said so 1 minute ago and she said sorry there's nothing she can do. I asked to speak with a manager and she told me I would have to go all the way to the front desk so at this point I knew I was screwed because the front desk is on the other side of the building and I would have to go through security again so I go to the front desk and of course there isn't a manager on duty and that I would have to call customer care so I do and explain the whole situation and they tell me there is nothing they can do for me besides charge me for the next flight which is two days out.",-1

I understand charging for a carry on bag. But if you didn’t pay on your way there at your first departing airport they shouldn’t charge you on your returning flight, especially $50 that’s absurd for a two and a half hour flight. Definitely won’t fly Allegiant again. The staff at Elmira Airport aren’t friendly and very unorganized.",-1

My Granddaughter, daughter, and myself were stranded in Ft. Walton Florida July 9, 2018 due to pilot clipping another Allegiant aircraft causing our flight to be cancelled. They wouldn't assist with letting us know why our flight was cancelled, what our options were, or anything until almost 4 hours after they had cancelled the flight. All they offered was a refund for our returning flight, or to put us on the next flight (with them) to Nashville which was not until Friday July 13th (Keep in mind this was a Monday, when we were suppose to be going home) which left us to find transportation, lodging, and accrue additional food expenses for the 3 of us, during one of the busiest tourist seasons in Florida, and it was all at our own expense due to and I quote “ We are a small company and not able to assist you with your unexpected monetary expenses” So we were on our own, stuck, frustrated, and incredibly stressed due to having to find last minute lodging, car rental, having extra food expenses, and my daughter almost losing her job because we could not return home when scheduled her company expected her to be there Tuesday July 10th to work but due to us being stuck in Florida with no options to get home until We finally found an option with Southwest airlines, granted it was out of Pensacola, Florida, for Wednesday July 11th, now this was a last minute flight so our tickets cost us $327.00 each totaling $981.00 plus all of the other expenses of the two days/nights prior, the stress from not knowing how we would get home, where we were even going to stay and sleep at night while having my young granddaughter with me.

However, they ruined my weekend plans and had me take half a day off work thinking my flight was leaving at 5pm instead of 11pm (the airport is an hour away from me).

All of the extra fees are very inconvenient and actually frustrating. I would recommend allowing the 50lbs luggage weight requirement instead of 40lbs. The representative at the counter during our return flight was very unprofessional. We also were told contradicting information regarding military baggage allowance. Upon reading the baggage information we noticed that the clerk on our return flight was not knowledgeable of the correct rules and had a nasty attitude. At the baggage terminal we were all standing st the wrong claim area due to incorrect information posted on the screen. We were finally redirected to the correct conveyor belt by an employee. I noticed customers looking for their luggage at the baggage terminal. They were being sent to find the airline office despite the fact that a member in their party was in a wheelchair. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.,-1

Worst flying experience ever, under staffed, poor communication and absurdly long delays. I spent almost a full day at the airport and still don’t know how I’m getting home. There’s been no communication, and confusion or intentional deception relayed by the staff. This is awful! I have never, in all my years, seen a company run so inefficiently.  This is an embarrassment to the airline industry. I do, however give props to the wonderful pilot and flight crew on the way out here. They were understaffed, but provided humor and warm smiles. The pilot was also great. The business is just in complete and utter chaos, which trickles down from what I would imagine is the worst leadership in the industry. This is not worth the cost.",-1
2018-07-22,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Las Vegas,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3.0,3,adventurous experience,True,"  Let me start my bad experience with a number system.  I checked - in online and download the boarding pass. I believe the concept of having E - boarding pass is to save some time at Airport. So I download the boarding pass and went a head to security but unfortunately my boarding pass bar code is not working here I have to mention the security person at check point he was so helpful to guide me using the barcode but no luck the bar code messed up after server attempts he advised me to go and get the boarding pass printed. Me again going back from the check point to the front desk wasted my time double then what it would take.(crazy is that they say they charge 5$ for printing boarding pass in person). Okay let me continue so I went and explained my problem to the lady at front desk she replied “they are very lazy they cannot even zoom the phone” I understand that she is referring to the security folks at check point and then I said me and they tired it several times and it did not work. After me giving the boarding pass to her She asked me “are you Nathan ?” Me what ? No I am not. She asked my first name and last name again.(she has my boarding pass In her hand) dunno why she asked again. When she said are you nathan ? Then I realized that my boarding pass might be messed up with a person name Nathan.  While I was going through all this stuff I am worried about losing the flight as they said boarding time is 4:38PM I almost confirmed that I will miss my flight. But the good thing for me and bad thing for airline is some people said “sir, don’t worry they never on time” but still I am little bit tense and the boarding was delayed 30mins because the flight I have to board arrived at gate at 5:13 PM approx. Ultimately I had a very tensed experience because I am not local and staying in USA I am from India and I am visiting my family in San Jose. Thanks Allegiant for the adventurous experience.",-1

Sunny, no clouds in Indianapolis and sunny, and no clouds in Fort Lauderdale yet, our flight is delayed 3 hours and counting. Plane is here. Everyone has checked in. Allegiant employees are saying the delay is due to the weather. I just flew through a tropical storm last month in the Caribbean via another airline - can’t be worse than that! Ruined my whole first day of vacation. Will tell everyone I know to avoid at all costs. Would rather pay double to fly a reliable airline than deal with this nonsense.

Website was easy to use and loved the ongoing reminders and alerts I was getting. Check In was  easy. Flights were good. Smooth landing. Seats are bit tight and you have to pay for any food/beverages but no big deal as it was a short flight. Definitely worth the money you pay for the flight still. Only issue was temperatures on both flights were very high and too cold for comfort would suggest wearing warm clothes or bring blanket. Would definitely use again and recommend. Wish they were closer than the drive to Niagara Falls NY.,1
2018-07-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not flying this airline again,True,"  So it started off with the morning of my flight. I received a notice that my seat assignment has changed. “No big deal” I thought, “it happens to every airline. About an hour after that I received another notification that my flight is delayed an hour. Keep in mind this is around 8AM and my flight was scheduled for 2PM. Again I thought “no big deal it happens”. However, as the day went on my flight kept getting delayed. Eventually we get to the airport and the flight is now delayed to 7PM. So I sit down and relax until it’s time to board. “Finally” I think to myself “I can now relax”. I sit down and wait for the rest of the flight to board, that’s when they tell us to deplane due to a maintenance issue. I hoped it wouldn’t take that long, but we were told that it can’t be fixed tonight. We’re told that they are sending a new aircraft but it’s not going to arrive until 11PM. All the while I’m thinking “how can an airline allow this much of a ripple effect to happen, to allow a flight to get delayed 9 hours. I’m not flying this airline again.",-1
2018-07-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Concord,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,never fly Allegiant again,True,"  Ft Lauderdale to Concord. Where to start? I have flown Allegiant for a few years because their airport in Concord is much closer (ten minutes) to my daughter's family than the Charlotte airport (forty minutes). But I have never enjoyed it mainly because one is never sure if the flight will happen. But this last trip took the cake and apart from returning home on my existing ticket, I will never, ever fly Allegiant again. I was accompanying my two grandsons, (11 and 14) back to their home on a 3:59 p.m. flight, arrival around 6:00 p.m. on July 13. Around 2:00 I got a text that flight delayed until 5:00, arrival 7:00. The problem was the plane coming to Fort Lauderdale (FTL) had equipment problems. The fact that the waiting area was clogged with folks on an earlier (10:30) flight one lady said, was a bad sign. Then we got an announcement they were sending a ""rescue plane"", yay, but it was smaller and they needed 4 volunteers and we had to get new seat assignments. Finally we boarded at 5:30 and left, only to land at Sanford, normally a half hour flight, an hour later where we deplaned. We left Sanford on yet another third plane with the same crew. The pilot apologized for the lack of info but said on the prior flight they had lost navigation and instrumentation and so had ""been pretty busy"". Thank God he and his co. had known what they were doing. The crew came through with the cart and I asked if they really meant to charge for beverages under the circumstances. I got three bottles of water for the boys and for me. We finally touched down at 10:30 p.m. The boys were exhausted. Their parents had tried to call customer service and were told there was a ""356 minute wait for an agent""! This morning I got an email with a lousy $50 voucher; I wonder if I could use it for drinks and snacks on the way home, since I will never fly Allegiant again. By the way the agents in FTL were wonderful and patient and tried their best under terrible circumstances. I don't think this airline deserves them. The upshot is that I have never flown an airline where so many of the delays were caused by equipment failures, as opposed to weather issues. Must be a very old, poorly maintained fleet and I no longer trust its safety. My recommendation: run, don't walk away from them.",-1
2018-07-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Louisville, Kentucky to Jacksoville, Florida",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,we waited two hours,True," Terrible. Delayed three hours and waited for luggage for 2 hours. Our flight time was shorter than the wait for our luggage. No one came to tell us why we were waiting so long, called the airline and they replied with an ""unavailable"" message. Other flights with Allegiant got their luggage on time while we waited two hours. No one came to explain why, 0/10. Seat trays were small, no food was offered, you could not lean in front and lay down to sleep.",-1
2018-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnati,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,bullies you into paying,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Cincinnati. On the trip from Cincinnati to Ft. Lauderdale we were delayed 4.5 hours. Communication was horrible from attendants. On the return trip, I was stopped at the counter before boarding. They said the roller bag I was carrying on to place in the overhead bin was too large. Mind you, this is the same 22"" roller bag I have flown with for years and placed in an over head bin. In fact, I flew down with this bag in the overhead bin on the same plane as I was returning. I was told I would be charged $50 for an over sized bag or I would not be able to fly. I ended up paying even though I had already paid a charge for carry on. I then boarded the plane and placed it in the overhead bin. I feel Allegiant bullies you into paying for all these ""extra"" fees to make up for the low airfare. I paid up front only to be hassled as the gate. I will never fly with them again even if they are cheaper.",-1
2018-07-12,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portsmouth to Orlando,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4,planes are very old,True,"  Portsmouth to Orlando. I would prefer to fly on the newer planes. The planes are very old with no USB slots for charging, no free wifi, no monitors on the back of each seat, the seats are very old and uncomfortable. There's no padding left. Have you ever heard of memory foam cushioning? Not even 1 free can of soda. There was nothing wrong with the flight other than the 2 hour delay. 3 hours of you count the very first change to the flight time a few months earlier. Every time we fly allegiant air there's a delay. The on time percentage must be in the 30% range. Landing and take off went as expected. The flight crew was nice.",-1
2018-07-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Provo,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,just got the runaround,False,"  I purchased 2 tickets round trip from Provo, UT to Los Angeles, CA for myself and my husband. Our return flight was scheduled from LAX on 6/8/18 at 11:50 AM. We spent 2 full days in the airport between delayed and canceled flights. We then get told in the end our flight was canceled completely and we had to find our own way home. We were given 2 prepaid cards and told they had $300 each. After we LA we found out both were empty. We spent an hour and a half on hold on with customer service on 6/10/18 only to be told they couldn't do anything and we had to e-mail in. I ended up speaking to a manager in the Provo airport, and was assured by him that the checks were already in the mail to refund the $600. We have waited over a month and have not received the money back. I am beyond furious at this point. I lost 2 days of work, totaling an amount of $330 in lost wages due to this. I am also out the extra money we had to spend on food while because we were there longer then expected. On top of all of that we our also out the money we had to spend to get myself and my husband home. We keep getting promised over and over that you would fix this and make it right, but in reality we have just got the runaround.",-1

I had read that they are unreliable, but the prices were so cheap I couldn’t resist. I wish I had. Sure enough they cancelled our flight with no reasoning. And no apology.

This airline is terrible, on our flight to Knoxville there was a 3 hour delay due to issues and on the way back there was a 1.5 hour delay due to the passenger count from the computer being different from the flight attendants count. This has been a terrible experience and I will never fly Allegiant Air again!",-1
2018-07-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Sanford,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,we cannot recommend it,True,"  My review is two-fold. 1) Actual trip experiences and 2) Modification of existing reservations.  Trip Experiences: We have flown from Memphis to Orlando on two separate occasions. Seat comfort: Seats are molded plastic with basic pad covering. Seats have no reclining feature, which is uncomfortable on flights over two hours. Flight attendants were generally agreeable, Bag check in lines were long, with a single attendant. Modification of existing reservations: I was unable to modify an existing reservation online. As a result, I placed a call to the call center. It took 1 hour, 23 minutes before I was connected to a call agent. Because of the type of ticket purchased (""standard ticket""), there are ""stiff penalties"" to make changes. Those penalties are $75 per person, per flight. All the call agent could offer was to waive half of the $300 cancellation fees (total of $150) and my pre-booked bag fee, but would not waive the other half. I was informed it would not be ""fair"" to the other passengers who paid for the flexible type reservation. Our request to change dates was made 11 days after the original reservations were placed and 2 weeks prior to our trip. Allegiant Airlines will be able to sell the seats we are unable to use and keep all proceeds from the sale of those seats. After adding the penalties for reservation changes to the original ticket prices, we could have flown on a first class carrier for less. Caution to Allegiant fliers, be aware of cancellation/modification penalties when booking your flights. Conclusion: After this third attempt to fly with Allegiant Air, we cannot in good conscious recommend it.",-1
2018-07-09,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tri City to Jacksonville,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,3,sat on the plane for almost 2 hrs,False,"  Tri City to Jacksonville. Arrived to the airport and boarded our plane to depart TN at 2:52, we sat on the plane at the gate for almost 2 hrs with no a/c and being told the fuel have was not working on one of the engines so they had to check it manually? First, too much info I needed to know, the pilot also said we need to make sure we have enough fuel to land, why would you say that to scare everyone on the case we do take off? They finally let us off the plane back to the gate area because of the heat. I should have been home by 6:30, I got home at 11pm.",-1
2018-07-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Petersburg Clearwater to Allentown,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,overpriced for the poorest service ever,True, The organization of Allegiant Air is the worst I have ever seen. Notification of a delayed flight went out way too late. A flight delayed until 3.15 but did not board until 3.45 and no announcement was made. A text msg did go out saying Boarding began at 2.26pm when it was after 3.00pm. There were then 4 flights going out of 2 gates within minutes of each other. No one knew what was going on or what flight was being boarded. I will never fly Allegiant again. Paid over $300 for a disaster of a travel day. Ridiculously overpriced for the poorest service ever!,-1
2018-07-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fargo,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4,Don't say I didn't warn you,True,"  Las Vegas to Fargo. I will never fly with Allegiant Air again. The way this airline does business is deceiving and they knowingly try to take advantage over their customers with add on nickle and dime fees, and poor customer service. I booked my flight for me and my family 2 months in advance. At that time we had 1 checked bag and 1 overhead carry on. We ended up needing 2 checked bags and no longer had use for the 1 overhead carry on. I tried to remove this carry on via their website and app but they don't allow you to do it. You can add bags no problem, but if you want to remove a bag they literally will not let you! I asked the customer service agent at the airport if they could remove the $43.00 bag charge as they could plainly see we did not have an overhead carry on with us. They told me no. I had to call their 1-800 number in order to get reimbursed.  On our way back home I actually asked another customer service agent again if they could help be take off the bag and they told me the same thing: call the 1-800 number. The flight was actually pleasant and the everyone was friendly on-board. A few hours after I got home from the return flight I called the 1-800 number. I was literally on hold for 1 hr and 25 minutes. I finally spoke with Kelly and told her what happened. She placed me on a brief hold and this is what she came back with: ""after speaking with my manager we can offer you a $43.00 voucher."" I told her I did not want a voucher for a bag I never brought on your airplane after notifying both customer service people at the airports. Her response was: ""since the customer service agent at the airport didn't make a notation on the computer system we can only offer you the voucher"". I told her my situation again, assuring her I did not bring on the overhead bag and that I notified both customer service people at the airport that I was not bringing a carry on bag onto the airplane. You would think the right thing to do would be to refund me $43.00 to keep the customer happy and move on? Do they think I'm lying and trying to sneak on a carry on bag for free to save $43.00 when I spent over $1,200 total on this trip? It makes no sense once so ever. I asked to speak with her manager directly and she would not let me. I asked her if $43.00 was worth losing a family of 4 for life? Her response was: ""Since we do not have proof you didn't bring the bag on the airplane we can only offer you a voucher"" So, because Allegiant makes it impossible to remove a bag once it is added and because you do not have the option to take this bag off either online or at the actual airport before your flight, they basically swindle you into yet another ""hidden charge"". I told her to keep the voucher and that me and my family will never be flying with this joke of an airline ever again. If you book a flight with Allegiant buyer be ware. It is not if, but WHEN you will be sucked in a nightmare of a situation either with fees, delays, customers service, you name it. Don't say I didn't warn you.",-1
2018-07-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Louisville to Savannah,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,2,stranded in an airport,True,"  Louisville to Savannah. After being nickled, dimed, and even pennied (which could have been over looked due to the price) I was then stranded in an airport for 7 hours due to a delay. The long delay was a result of maintenance on the plane, not weather. This could have been easily prevented and or fixed by sending another plane after the 3 hour delay announcement. My flight which was scheduled to take off at 2:30 is now taking off at 9:30 for a 1.45 hour flight. At this point it would have been faster to drive the 9 hours home. They did however provide a voucher for a discount on a flight and a refreshment. The crew has been as accommodating as possible but I will not be redeeming my voucher in off chance this happens again.",-1

2018-07-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Wichita to Phoenix,1.0,,3.0,,,5.0,3,5 hours for a 2 hour flight,True,"  We were trapped in the plane for 5 hours for a 2 hour flight from Wichita to Phoenix. They had a discrepancy on the headcount with one more person on board than was supposed to be. After the whole crew and a ground personnel counted multiple times, they brought the passenger manifest and verified and again were 1 off. Then they verified by boarding passes and still had the problem. About 15 minutes later when we had waited for almost 2 hours. They decided that it was a bag that they had been mistaking for a person. They pulled away from the gate and sat for 15 more minutes. We started taxing and then they stopped again for about 10 minutes. They decided that they did not have enough fuel, so we went back to the gate for more fuel. Finally, after almost 3 hours, we got to take off. No free drinks, no snacks, just a nervous apology. I know why they were off by one person, but they never figured it out. We could have had someone with bad intent get on the flight and they just called the extra person a (bag).",-1
2018-07-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Des Moines,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The worst experience,True,  Las Vegas to Des Moines. The worst experience with this company ever. All the way from customer service to gate agents. Two flights cancelled on the front end and back end while at the airport due to maintenance of planes. Do you not know before hand when plans need to have scheduled maintenance? However they do feel they fairly compensate you with an $8 food voucher and put you in a undesirable hotel. You ever try to buy a meal at an airport for $8? Not to mention the travel vouchers you receive when they cancel your flight is insane for all the hardship they cause. Please just post a standard way of how you compensation/vouchers online so you can be consistent. A flyer on our same flights received double our voucher.,-1
2018-07-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati Ft Lauderdale,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,worst experience ever,True,"  Cincinnati Ft Lauderdale. This was single worst experience ever. First we were all on plane door closed safety speech was given and then they asked us to exit the plane for mechanical issues. They kept us waiting around for 3.5 hours before canceling flight by this time there were no more flights available to get to Ft Lauderdale. The gate agents left because they had no answers and hid, as matter of fact 4 agents quit on the spot. This airline doesn't give hotel and ground transportation vouchers instead they give you an Amex rewards card that is supposed to have $300 on the card, but of course mine had zero. So I had to pay for Uber and Hotel out of my pocket. Now onto the next morning for my rescheduled flight at 8:00 AM out of CVG to Ft Lauderdale. I get to the gate at 7:10 the monitor says on time and boarding to begin in 10 minutes, problem no plane. Then at 8:00 AM gate agent tells us flight delayed mechanical issues she will update us every 30 minutes. So I call customer service wait 25 minutes for someone to answer, he tells me they are getting new plane, be taking off at 10:00 AM. Then gate agent tells me new plane has mechanical issues and no time is set for take off. The gate agent then goes and hides and nobody at gate to answer questions. They put out Soda and Ice. Well I spot a stack of meal vouchers and I find the one with my name on it and give to a women who is hungry and she uses the $8.00 voucher for some food. Another woman asks the gate agent who appears after 90 minutes and the agent looks woman in the face and lies, says we have no such vouchers. Well finally at 12:30 flight takes off and we get back to Ft Lauderdale. Where I now have to pay $30 extra for parking and $50 extra for boarding my dog and $250 extra for a Nurses aide to help my mom because I could not be there. Now let's talk about customer service and the $300 I am supposed to have to help offset these extra expenses. I have spoken to 7 or 8 agents, supervisors etc. They tell me it is Amex's fault I don't have the money, please wait 36 hours from time we got card to check for funds, well 36 hours came and went still ZERO on the card. I call Amex as told to do by customer service supervisor and Amex whom I never had a problem with in 33 years of membership and they explain that it is on the airline. So I call back and now management at customer service now is not available. In closing If this airline was only option to go somewhere I just wouldn't go. By far worst experience ever and I was just going home.",-1
2018-07-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,don't book Allegiant Air,True,"  Cincinnati to Orlando. I wish I had better words for how awful this experience was for us. We checked in at the terminal desk over an hour before our flight was to leave, but when we got to the terminal 30 minutes before the flight was to leave it was closed up. Not a person on duty. Not an attendant. Doors locked. We watched them load up the luggage in the plane, watched them pull vans up, then pull away. Watched them finally pull the equipment away from the wheels and then pull the extendable gate back so they could take off. 30 minutes of complete powerlessness. We stayed on the our phones and even sent a support email trying to get through to customer service the entire time hoping we could get through to someone. Delta saved our butts and got us to Orlando in time to catch our cruise sailing out in those few hours. But wait. There's more. When we get back from our cruise and go to check in for our return flight they cancelled our return flight. No emails. No calls. And they tell us at the gate we can pay for another ticket for a flight we had already paid for.  Thankfully a gal at Allegiant did refund us for the return flight so that we didn’t pay twice. But still working on resolution for almost missing our cruise. Do your vacation a favor...don't book Allegiant Air.",-1

Lightening storm. Then servicing the bathroom for 30 minutes. Excuse after excuse. Would not give a water but the flight attendant stood in front of me with her ice water. Seriously get it together. You may fly to random places so people use you. But this will be our families last. Always always late taking off and rude when you inquire. It’s a sad unprofessional way to operate an airline company. I’ll be cancelling credit card as well. Won’t need to accumulate those points.,-1

Got to the airport 2 hours before my flight, I waited in two different lines for almost 2 hours while Allegiant employees shouted names and flights. There is no intercom.

This airline is the worst in all aspects!",-1
2018-06-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Harrisburg to Myrtle Beach,,,,,,1.0,1,Never fly this airline,False,"  I put my children and grandmother on flight 1109 leaving from Harrisburg pa to Myrtle Beach SC to meet my mother. They were scheduled to take off at 9:15, so we arrived two hours early. When we left our house(an hour away) the flight was still listed as on time. 15 minutes before arriving to the airport I looked it up and saw it was delayed until 11:20. When we arrived, no Allegiant employees were at the check in counter and we were informed by a skycap that they won’t arrive to answer questions until 2 hours before flight time. So with the delay we had 2 hours to wait until an employee could answer any of our questions. Imagine sitting in an airport with two young children excited to go to the beach. 9:00 rolls around, the employees offer no explanation as to the delay, we check our bags and head to security the TSA agents put my children and grandmother through, and as they were walking through the metal detectors an agent mentioned that since their flight was delayed to 11:45 (mind you the last update we received and was posted was 11:20) they may not get to take off by midnight and if they can’t be in the air by midnight the flight would be cancelled. So I’ve sat right outside of security since 9PM (now 11:33 and the incoming is just landing) waiting to hear if the flight will take off. Only problem is? There are no longer any TSA agents at security, and all of Allegiant employees have left for the day. How am I supposed to feel safe knowing my children and grandmother are on this flight? Especially when no employees are here to answer any questions or offer any explanations to delays. To top it off the skycap that greeted us at our original arrival shrugged his shoulders and said “its Allegiant that’s what they do, they delay flights for no reason with no explanation” Never fly this airline.",-1

I was supposed to leave 8am Thursday morning and found out late Wednesday night that my flight had been cancelled with no explanation or warning. I took off many days of work for this trip to happen and now I am unable to do the full trip. I am losing out on money that I could have made at work and losing money on my flight. The $150 voucher compensation is not enough to make up for this awful mistake. All that voucher does is encourage you to come back and spend more money on their flights, which may or may not even happen. I cannot trust Allegiant Air anymore. Just about every time I fly with them my flight either gets cancelled or pushed way back. I would encourage everyone to stay far away from this airline. Terrible experiences.",-1

Every time I have flown out of San Diego on Allegiant Air has been frustrating. I’ve flown with the same carryone bag for the past 5 years, have flown on Alaska, Delta, Southwest and Alligiant with the bag and never had any issue with putting it under my seat. Today as I am getting on the plane I’m told my bag is to big and I must pay for an overhead bin spot. I flew down from Bellingham the week before on the same aircraft and no issues. Same thing happened with my wife and we were slapped with $100 fee to take our bags on the plane even though 6 days prior we had flown with no issue. Customer service at the San Diego airport is non-existent. Last year I was flying with my 1 year old son and was not allowed to board because I did not have photo ID for him. I had flown down From Washington 2 days ago with no issue but was not allowed to board in San Diego to go home because no photo ID of my 12 month old boy.

Coming to FLL our plane was delayed two times and now going back to Concord its delayed again twice. Why even have a time to come or go back? It wasn't because of the weather neither trip.

My saga began when I received an in-app notification to check-in for my flight. I began the check-in process and planned to change my seat assignment (I was traveling with my 11 month old son and thought it would be best for everyone if I reserved a window seat). I was more than willing to pay $25 for this “upgrade”. So I selected my new seat, but there was an issue with the check out process (not sure what). I tried again, I tried a third time with a different card (perhaps they didn’t like that I used my Delta Airlines Amex to pay for my upgrade). Still can’t check-in, I switched to my laptop and tried a fourth time, now the website said “you’ve tried checking-in and we can’t process this”. What! So I send off a contact us request (the automated email response said they would get back to me in 7 days!). As I am flying the next day I call the number provided (not a 1-800 number, so I have to run up my sister’s long distance bill). Now, here is where it gets frustrating, I get a busy signal, for an hour I try calling back, each time I get a busy signal. Finally, it rings through, at which point I spend an hour and a half on hold before my issue is resolved. This was ridiculous, I wasted the last day I had with my family to take care of this issue. I’m so upset and frustrated with the whole process, the discount price is not worth this chaos!",-1

Keep in mind while reading this that Allegiant and Alaska Air were the only airlines at this airport so my choices were nil. After turning in our rental car we proceeded to ticketing/check-in only to be told that our flight was delayed for 6 hours (1:26 am). They asked if I received an email (obviously I did not) and I replied no then she said it's because we went through a 3rd party booking agent and that was the only email address they had. Now if they would have contacted my agent, they would have emailed me and made arrangements accordingly but as it was I missed my connecting flight in Las Vegas and was in their airport for over 12 hours trying to get a flight home. I lost 2 days of work and an additional $1100.00 for airline tickets. Allegiant was gracious enough (I state sarcastically) to give us each an $8.00 voucher that expired at midnight. And I never received the $50 voucher by email that they were going to send immediately. If you have to use them then by all means please have a back-up plan. But if you don't have to then I suggest you find another.",-1
2018-06-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Pete/Clearwater to Greensboro,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,they are unreliable,False,"  St. Pete/Clearwater to Greensboro. After 6 hours of constant incremental delays of 1 hour each and 2 gate changes, my patience was exhausted. My daughter expected to meet me at the Greensboro airport around 8 PM. Now, if they weren't lying again and a plane was actually going to show up, my daughter was looking at having to meet me at the Greensboro airport at 1:20 AM. I had enough. I asked the gate agent if I could cancel my flight and get a full refund. She assured me that I could and quoted me the exact price that I paid and told me the refund took about 2 business days to get back in my account. I cancelled the flight and left the airport because Allegiant could not live up to their advertising hype. The full refund was also a lie. After sitting in the airport for 6 hours and being ""compensated"" with a couple of slices of cold, stale pizza and a soft drink, Allegiant emailed me a voucher for $50.00. The flight did get to Greensboro eventually, but there appeared to be one more delay and the arrival time in Greensboro was 2:30 AM. As far as I am concerned, I will never fly Allegiant again. The CEO can take my voucher and stick it. I found a major airline that flies from Tampa to Charlotte for $3.00 less. It's a 1 hour drive for my daughter to Charlotte, but they don't have 7 hour delays. Based on Allegiant's interminable delays, I could have driven in only 5 hours more time at a lot less cost Allegiant continually highlights the difference between being transported and being shipped. Do not fly Allegiant. They are unreliable and customer service means nothing to them.",-1
2018-06-10,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Petersburg to Norfolk,3.0,,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2,thanks for poor service,False,"  St. Petersburg to Norfolk. It's ok to delay a week or so prior to flight. Not ok to do several times the day before and on the date of flight. It's a huge inconvenience for the people flying as well as people picking passengers up. There were no weather issues and they don't have any explanation as to why. The 2nd time I've had issues with allegiant. When flying in January VA had a snow storm the airport reported closed that am. Allegiant still had it as the flight was still on time and flying it. Allegiant waited to an hour before the flight was set to take off to send notification the flight was cancelled. The airport was an hour away and a huge inconvenience. You can forget calling because the wait was an hour hold. This time I had issues with delays the kept making again, called in and waited 30+ minutes to get someone. Asked to speak to a supervisor 8 times the rep refused and was down right rude. Didn't see why I had an issue and suggested I cancel my flight all together. I was on the phone over an hour and still never got a supervisor and still didn't get checked in my flight. No kind of accommodation or willingness to assist. And you guys damaged my suit case! Thanks for poor service Allegiant.",-1
2018-06-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Indianapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no text message about delay,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Indianapolis. Congratulations Allegiant for being the worst airline in history. Major delays both to our destination and back. The return home took the cake. Our 2:15 flight was delayed until 4:30 with no text message about this delay, and they also acted like this was the normal flight time and not a delay. We had no internet while we were on vacation, so we could not check email about delays. Then the Allegiant attendent said we couldn't check our bags in for another 3 hours. Then we asked where their was a place for us to eat where we didn't have to go through security, and she said it was around the corner. That 'around the corner' was a mile and half walk schlepping our luggage along to find a restaurant. We were also told there was no shuttle to that restaurant, but there was. Took the shuttle back to find that there had been restaurants downstairs in baggage claim. We didn't even have to go that mile and half. Finally check in takes place, and the attendant says that she has to charge us 25 dollars for printing out our boarding passes. This did not occur when we took our flight going to our destination. Also, when we took our flight to our destination, the Allegiant attendant weighed all our bags together to get a total weight for overage. We did not go over at that time. Coming back, we did not have any additional weight in our bags, but the attendant couldn't add the bag weights together to get a total. Apparently she flunked math in school. So another 50.00 was charged. This is addition to not being able to pick our pets up in time and getting charged another night at the kennel. You also cannot reach a human on their phone. Nice dodge Allegiant.",-1
2018-06-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Tampa,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,never fly Allegiant again,False,  Tulsa to Tampa. I have flown this trip to Florida 6 times now. 8 out of 10 of my flights were delayed. Today we was notified of a 2 hour delay but as we were going through security we were told another 6.5 hour delay. So after being dropped off at airport we are stuck here for 6.5 hours. They give me a $50 voucher good for next flight only. We will never fly Allegiant again.,-1
2018-06-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Indianapolis,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,1,delayed both leaving and returning,False,  Orlando to Indianapolis. This is our first flight with this airline. We were delayed both leaving and returning by 3 hours each time. Delay notifications weren’t sent out until already at the airport. Do not use this airline unless you plan for delays in your travel details. I would like to have some of my money back but that won’t happen because they rip people off. I will never use this airline ever again.,-1
2018-06-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bentonville to Sanford,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,invent new ways to create delays,False,"  Our flight to Sanford was delayed around 5 hours because our original aircraft was deemed “non-operational” after it landed (which is worrisome itself) and another aircraft from Memphis had to come pick us up. Our flight back to Bentonville was delayed nearly 2.5 hours because they “needed to collect all necessary signatures to complete their paperwork”. It’s like they invent new ways to create delays. When you factor in all the fees, cost of food/drinks, etc this airline is only minimally cheaper than other, more reliable airlines. And depending on how much you value being on time and keeping your schedule (many travelers on our Sanford flight had reservations at DisneyWorld which were missed due to the delay), it isn’t worth it at all. The flight attendants said each time that the delays weren’t typical, which I find hard to believe since nearly all Allegiant flights at both airports had “delayed” next to them on the arrivals/departures screens. The fact that it is a direct flight is great, but unless your trip has a few days of flexibility at the beginning and end of it to allow for similar delays, I’d recommend using another airline.",-1

Was sent from one ticket counter to another trying to check-in. We went all the way through security only to get to the wrong set of gates and was told to exit and go back through the original security check point were we started. Barely made it through security in time to get on the plane, didn't even get a chance to eat beforehand, and were at the airport over 1.5 hours ahead of time for a domestic flight. Absolute trash.",-1
2018-06-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Orlando,,,,,,1.0,1,had to pay an additional $260,False,"  Austin to Orlando. Booked a flight towards the end of June to see my father who was in hospice, but his condition suddenly took a turn for the worse and so three days after I made the reservation I had to rebook so I could fly out to see him before he died. I called the airline hoping they might rebook me with some kind of discount considering the circumstances, since I was already really stretching my budget with the original booking. Was told they didn't make any exceptions for ""bereavement"" and had to pay an additional $260 on top of my original fare. Looking online, that policy is hidden so deeply in their fine print you wouldn't even know about it unless you thought to look it up beforehand. So, now on top of my dad's death, I get to enjoy being short on bills.",-1

It’s worth it!",-1

Then another 1/2 hour delay then back on the airplane. The return fight was Cancelled completely after 3 more delays. Save your time. It’s not worth the discount.",-1

My flight has so far been delayed over 6 hours. Absolutely no ground service to take complaints and questions and no certain answers as to whether or not our plane will actually arrive on time. No compensation has been given for the well over 150 angsty passengers sitting in the terminal. Don’t fly Allegiant. It’s a nightmare.,-1
2018-05-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rochester to Sanford,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst experience ever,True,  Rochester to Sanford. Flying with Allegiant has to have been the worst experience ever. On my way to Florida my flight was supposed to depart at 10:30 am but I we didn’t board until almost an hour later and didn’t take off until around 12:30pm. On our way back we almost missed our flight because we were held up for over an hour trying to figure out why we had to pay for our baggage a second time and then we found out that one of the staff mixed up our reservation and added one bag to the wrong reservation. Long story not so short is basically I’ll never fly with them ever again.,-1
2018-05-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Myrtle Beach,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,never be flying them again,True,"  Cincinnati to Myrtle Beach. My family and I chose Allegiant air solely based on price, and I can say without hesitation that I will never be flying with them again. First flight was not only delayed an hour and a half, but once we boarded a safety issue was discovered which took another hour to resolve. Flight home was delayed 3 hours and then to top it off we had to switch planes due to a safety issue with the first. No amount of money saved will ever make this experience worth it. Spend the extra money for peace of mind. The only reason I gave 1/10 is because they gave us a complimentary snack for our troubles.",-1

This was the very first time I traveled with Allegiant Air. Never again will I use them. My flight was supposed to leave at 1:30 p.m. and I did not get out on my flight till 10pm - 11:30 p.m. I did not arrive at my destination till 1 AM. That was a 10 hour delay flight from me. All they told me was it was going to be delayed for a few minutes due to maintenance. After a few minutes then delayed again and delayed again. They never said the main reason. I felt like they were giving excuses after excuses. They did give me two food vouchers and a $100 voucher for my next flight. Which I don't think it's enough for what this Airline took away from me that day. I had reservations at a certain times, I could have gone to work and I missed a whole days of work. I had plans and Allegiant ruined it all. And the flight returning back home was 2 hours delayed, not too bad, if i compare it to my 10 hour delayed from days prior, but still delayed. If anyone plans on traveling with Allegiant Air make sure to take a sweater or blanket. You may be there longer than expected.again.",-1

Disgusted,True,"  St. Petersburg to Hagerstown return was a disaster as both legs were over 3 hours delayed and put us in MD and FL, respectively in the wee hours of the morning. The outbound was said to be due to ""mechanical"" problems. The return gave us no reason. So we waited in Hagerstown airport from 3pm until 12:30 am with no food available and the constant loud din of TSA warnings every 45 seconds for 6 hours. The seats were hard, the Avis rental car agent had gone home for the night. Misery! Hungry. Tired. Disgusted. Never agin will we fly on this airline. We are 80 years old and the discomfort, the danger of driving to our hotel/home at 3 a.m. in the rain is something never want to do again.v",-1
2018-05-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Concord to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,was the worst experience,False,"  This was my first time flying with this airline and it was the worst experience I have ever encountered with an airline. I absolutely do not like flying Spirit Airlines but I would choose them any day over Allegiant. I was out of town on personal business and the communication from this airline is unprofessional, bootleg, rude and inconsiderate. My flight was to leave out on May 20th heading to Fort Lauderdale and I was given no notice until after 30 minutes of me standing in line. The airline didn't even bother to notify me before my flight, i learned from other passengers. Then they were attempting to place all of these passengers on an already booked flight with no compensation for the troubles. I had to pay $400.00 to catch a flight out of North Carolina with another airline. The customer service suck, the communication suck and this company sucks.",-1

When I purchased these tickets everyone told me and warned me about Allegiant but I figured I would find out myself - unfortunately they were right. The Stanford Orlando airport staff lack of any leadership they do whatever they want and treat customers terribly. We were yelled at told to wait and wait wait until finally our flight gets canceled and no other ones left to PR same day. I had to purchase all brand new tickets with American Airlines go make it back home. Worst part about it is they wouldn’t refund all my money back.,-1

Boarding ended at 10:11am and we ran to the gate and arrived at 10:12pm only the be refused entry onto the plane because everyone was boarded. This was a flight for work. I've never been denied a flight when a minute late especially when the gate was changed by the airline at the last minute. I had to buy a ticket with another airline today because of 1 minute.

My family of 4 people including 2y.o. baby flew from Oakland and didn’t have any problem with car seat, but in Las Vegas they decided it’s too big. We also had checked in one suitcase exactly 40 lb. The weight and size was absolutely the same as in Oakland. Yes, it was little baby pillow and 6 extra diapers inside, what is weight no more then 1 lb. So I had to move diapers to my purse and pillow we were carrying in hands. A front of the whole line of checking in crowd this scandal was stupid! Did it change total weight of our stuff on the plane? No!!! They just made our flight very uncomfortable and destroyed our mood on the way home and aftertaste of our vacation. On a top of this, check in employee made a mark on our printed tickets to make extra search before boarding on plane in baby stroller, so we waste extra time and stopped the crowd for boarding. And nothing was in stroller! How stupid revenge she did! And one more on a top of this: flight was delay 50 minutes. And in Las Vegas they made us to run between gates: at first it was gate 11, then 8, and finally 4. What a comfortable and friendly Allegiant! Thank God flight attendants were super nice, and to relieve our stress we bought wine and snacks. And this is the last time we spend money with Allegiant, goodbye !",-1

I am a young adult on a budget and I am not able to afford to nights in a hotel in Vegas not expecting it. The staff were extremely rude and when we were kicked off they told us they would get our bag and call over the intercom where it was.

My husband who is handicapped, was crammed in the middle seat with his knees pressed into the seat in front of him. The flight attendants were nice, but young and immature in their behavior. We spoke with someone at the Allegiant counter when we landed in Fort Lauderdale and that representative told us that Allegiant falsely labels seats as first class when they are not. She told us that is the biggest complaint she receives but she can't do anything about it. We will not use Allegiant ever again.",-1

I went to gate agent at gate and tried to explain what happened but he would not listen to anything I was trying to explain. We paid for service that was changed when flight was changed.

2018-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Columbus,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,delayed twice with no explanation,True," This airline seems to always have issues and I’ve given them multiple chances. The first time I flew with them from Hilton Head to Columbus, they accidentally sent my belongings to Seattle. I understand mistakes happen but they didn’t reimburse me for the items I had to go re-purchase nor offer any kind of apology or incentive. Another incident, my husband and I got married in Hilton Head last year and my aunt and uncle and 2 friends were on the same flight from Columbus to Hilton Head and their flight was continuously getting delayed all day and then canceled due to technical difficulties. They were told that they would fly in a separate plane and leave the next day. The flight was then delayed again all day and they finally left that evening. They had missed 2 whole days of their vacation and Allegiant offered to pay for those 2 days they missed at their condo however, when it came down to it, my aunt kept reaching out and never heard back to get reimbursed. My most recent flight with them from Fort Lauderdale to Columbus was my final straw with the airline. We were heading back home after a cruise and our flight was scheduled for 3.20pm. We had to be off the cruise ship by 8.15 so we got to the airport fairly early. We were expecting to be able to check in and get through security to be able to eat breakfast and lunch to occupy our time. They wouldn’t let us check in until 12.51pm because we were checking bags. So we sat at the airport with 7 of us and all of our luggage for 5 hours with no access to food or shops with snacks, etc. The girls at the check in desk didn’t apologize for the inconvenience or explain why they wouldn’t let us back. Instead, they chuckled. We then finally got to check in and our flight was delayed twice with no explanation. Finally, we get on the plane and sat for an hour and a half before taking off. The whole time we sat there, there was a continuous loud beeping noise the whole hour and a half sitting waiting to take off. We then take off and they offer us complimentary water for the inconvenience. Needless to say, this airline is a joke, their employees are extremely rude, and we will never fly with them again. I would rather spend more money with a reliable company than with this joke of a company.",-1

I paid the 105 so I could get home just to find out that it was delayed 2 hours, then 4 hours, then 5, and ended up not leaving till 1:30 in the morning, 7.5 hours later than the original flight was scheduled. We arrived to an empty airport at 4 in the morning. They’ve refused to refund the extra money for a seat I had already paid for claiming it was a courtesy that I even got on the flight.

Allegiant  claims the wind is too strong for them to land here in Bismarck - every other plane scheduled is on time and landing and taking off. So now we must sit here in the airport until 11.15 tonight when they can get another airplane in here. Allegiant is doing nothing to accommodate customers. They simply don’t give a dam.  I called customer service and they said there is nothing they can do. Why don’t you try being honest and tell your customers the real reason you cancelled this flight.,-1

Then I found out something worse! I had made my car reservation through Allegiant, cancelled directly with Enterprise in Rochester NY but this is known as third party booking. I could not get a refund from Enterprise because they did not collect the funds. Allegiant does not give any refunds for any reason, including car rentals and hotels which are done when booking your flight on the Allegiant site.",-1
2018-05-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Pete Clearwater to Indianapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,little communication from anyone,True,"  Flight #1857 from PIE to IND was supposed to depart at 4:27pm on March 16th, 2018. The first notification of delay came at 11:20am saying that the flight was delayed until 5:40pm. The second notification of delay came at 1:08pm saying that the flight was delayed until 7:00pm. The third notification of delay came at 5:04pm saying that the flight was delayed until 11:45pm. The fourth notification of delay came at 7:57pm saying that the flight was delayed until 12:45am. The aircraft did not arrive in PIE until 2:00am. The flight did not leave until about 3:00am on March 17th, 2018. We finally arrived at IND around 5:00am, but could not get off the plane until 5:30am because the crew at IND was not ready for us. We arrived 11 hours late. The crew at PIE said they were giving out meal vouchers to everyone on the plane, which is fine except the only thing available to eat at PIE includes: a small coffee shop, a limited bar, and a gift shop, which all closed around 8pm. Realizing their mistake, the crew at PIE orders pizza for the passengers. They did not account for people which dietary restrictions, like myself. I could not eat the pizza, otherwise I would get severely sick. So I sat in the PIE airport/airplane for about 11 hours, only having water. I was physically ill once I arrived in IND because I had no access to food for such a long period of time. I would've purchased some snacks on the plane, except the flight attendants did not serve everyone. I was one of those individuals that was not served. One would think that after 11 hours of delay, someone, just one person, would show some kind of customer service, but nope. I did not eat for 12.5 hours that day, because I did not have access to food, even on the airplane. One might ask, ""Why didn't you just leave the airport and go buy something at a restaurant?"" and then answer is ""because we physically could not leave."" TSA closed around 12:30am. Nobody could leave or enter the airport. Nobody. We were legitimately trapped inside the gate area. The option to cancel my flight or reschedule the flight was given. Except once you cancelled or rescheduled your flight, you couldn't leave the airport. You were still trapped inside the airport with those waiting for the aircraft to arrive. I was faced with two options in reality: 1) Wait for the plane to finally show up at 2am, with the possibility of it being cancelled (as explained in the next paragraph), or 2) Cancel/Reschedule my flight, but not being able to leave the airport until TSA opened the next morning so that they can open the exit doors. That would have left me in the airport, which i was told, until 5am. Physically being trapped in the airport, I decided to stick it out because at least I would be out of PIE by 5am. There was very little communication from anyone from Allegiant. I called customer service on 3/16/18 to ask why the flight was so delayed and what they were going to do for us, the passengers. After 58 minutes of being on hold, the agent raised her voice at me 3 times.  She said something along the lines of ""if the plane arrives at PIE at around midnight, they could cancel the flight."" That is not something people that have already been waiting 8 hours want to hear.",-1

We were delayed by 8 hours and I’m writing this sitting from the airport possibly awaiting even more delay. This airline is notorious for having terrible aircraft therefore constantly making unwanted emergency stops (why our plane isn’t here) and then delaying everyone. If you only have a few hours delay with other airlines consider yourself lucky and avoid this budget airline which is a total joke. Save yourself. And I’m one for traveling budget airlines and do often but this was my first and last time ever flying Allegiant. Not worth saving $100 which you end up spending on baggage water and all the food you have To buy while waiting for the delayed flight. Also this would have gotten 0 stars if that was an option.,-1
2018-04-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Norfolk,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,3,couldn't care less,True,  Fort Lauderdale to Norfolk. My flight was canceled because they said a bird destroyed the engine beyond repair. Never heard about that by anyone else at the front desk nor on the news. They didn't accommodate anyone even those people who had connecting flights. They said they would book you on a flight much later in the evening the next day. Full refund if you wanted that. I had to book with United and the cost was more 1 way then my round trip with Allegiant. They couldn't care less about anyone else but themselves. They should give a voucher for another trip plus a full refund. Look at all the money and business they lost over this.,-1
2018-04-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3,Most uncomfortable seats ever,True,"  Milwaukee to Ft Lauderdale. First and last time I will fly this airline. Most uncomfortable seats ever. Not even a seat back pocket. Hours late. Delays, delays, delays. And nothing but excuses. Rude flight attendants. You get what you pay for.  I’ll forgo our return flight and book flights home on another airline.",-1
2018-04-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Indianapolis,1.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,the worst delayed experience,True,"  I flew Allegiant Air from Jacksonville,  yesterday, Sunday, April 15th, 2018 to Indianapolis My flight was schedule at 9:43 am, because of the problem with the aircraft, it was delayed until 8.20 pm in the evening. If I didn't want to fly last night, the next flight would be next Thursday. At the end I left Jacksonville at 9pm and landed in Indianapolis around 10.30 pm. This was the worst delayed experience I had ever encountered, the company gave me 2 $50 voucher to use for the future flight with Allegiant. For sure I will never fly with this carrier again. I hope this company will close down for the way it treated the passengers for the more than 12 hours delayed.",-1
2018-04-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Greenville to Ft Lauderdale,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,by far the worst airline,True,"  Allegiant Air is by far the worst airline I have used! I’m vacationing in Florida from Greenville, SC only to find out that our bag was left in Greenville and not put on the plane! After calling Allegiant Air and being hung up on twice they they tell me that our luggage can’t be sent out til Monday 4/9 and that’s when we are due to return home. They told me they will have someone give me a call to see what could be done for me and here we are 10 hours later and i have yet to hear from Someone.",-1
2018-04-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Raleigh-Durham,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"staff, rude, rude, rude",True," New Orleans to Raleigh-Durham. I've never flown on a more unprofessional airline in my life. First off I understand charging for checked luggage but going from $20 online to $50 is insane. And then to charge you for printing a boarding pass is crazy. Lets not talk about the staff, rude, rude, rude. Everyone including the flight attendants were rude. No matter how cheap their flights are, flying with them will never happen again.",-1
2018-04-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Belleville,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,smarter to pay for another airline,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Belleville. To save your time please do not fly Allegiant if you want to ride an unreliable plane or want to be late by like 10 hours. The flight attendants didn’t tell us anything, also very rude - they refunded us 50$ that we can only use to use to purchase other plane tickets for Allegiant Air, an 8$ meal voucher that didn’t even work and a can of soda. Terrible service and low quality planes. You get what you pay for so it is smarter to pay for another airline.",-1
2018-04-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Wichita,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,will never fly Allegiant again,True," After my husband I tried to sit together in ""open"" seats, the flight attendant got angry and went up front. Ten minutes later, a female with a McCarran airport sweater, said that if I wanted to stay on board that I couldn't make one peep during the flight. If I so much as made one peep the pilot would turn the plane around and I would be taken off and I would not be given a refund. Do they have the right to do that? After reading a bunch of documents at the FAA website, it seems as though they can only kick you off it they feel you are a safety risk. Then after you are rescreened by TSA and found not to be a risk you are to be rebooked on another flight or allowed to take your original flight if it has not already departed. Nowhere did it say that the airline can just throw you off and abandon you. I was not a safety or security risk and they knew it. I just wrinkled their feathers when I asked them why we couldn't change seats, and also asked for badge information. Their responses for why we couldn't change seats was laughable. Needless to say I will never fly Allegiant again. I am posting this review so that if you are considering taking this airline, you might want to reconsider.",-1
2018-04-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St Pete Clearwater to Austin,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,costing more than a major airline,True,"  St Pete Clearwater to Austin. You have to pay $60 to put your carryon in the overhead. I thought this would be a time saver on my regular flights to Austin. With the required shuttle ride because Allegiant is not landing at the main terminal it adds an hour to my trip (30 minutes each way). By the time it was all over, the “cheap” flight ended up costing more than a major airline. No beverage service. Rude waitresses.",-1
2018-03-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Asheville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,gives no heads up during delays,True," Allegiant Air is by far the most classless organization currently in operation. It seems that this airline is run by animals. Every single time I fly with them (forced to fly with this airline as they are the only direct route from South Florida to Asheville) the flight is delayed. This airline gives no heads up during delays, no emails, nothing. It’s particularly upsetting because it seems they have plenty of notice that the incoming flight is delayed, so they should know and have the respect of letting their customers know when they do. This organization lacks class, humanity, respect and culture. I could give a million examples, but I won’t waste any more of my time. The way I see it, you’re better off taking another airline with a connection, because that would most likely leave on time and get you there at the same time Allegiant will, with their massive delays. Never take this airline.",-1
2018-03-26,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St Petersburg / Clearwater to Niagara Falls,4.0,,2.0,,,3.0,4,rollercoaster communications,True," We returned home 8 days ago, final flight with Allegiant Air from St Petersburg / Clearwater to Niagara Falls. Upon arrival, out of 200 passengers, only we had missing luggage. Allegiant clerk quickly advised that somehow one bag went to Orlando but would be immediately re-routed and delivered to Canada. Sure, no problem, Canada customs agent assured us that airlines deliver lost luggage all the time and no problem crossing the border. By Sunday, no bags and started rollercoaster communications with Allegiant and finally was informed that bag was sent via FedEx and was given a tracking number. Great, now we could watch its travels. Tuesday it was resting in Toronto waiting for release from customs. Now began ommunications with FedEx and end result was that we would have to personally arrange customs clearance. Went down to Niagara Falls with documents and was advised that they couldn't do the release there and would have to go to Canada customs at Toronto airport. Called customs in Toronto and very nice man confirmed that was true. Back with FedEx to see if we could arrange a one time power of attorney - nope. So today we did the 120 mile round trip, waved to all the passing cars on the QEW, hwys. 407, 401 and others, toured Toronto airport, became expert at using gps and now arrived home with missing bag. At least it was nice that Allegiant shipped at no charge, and nice customs agent advised that no charge for customs clearance.",1
2018-03-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Belleville to Orlando,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,delays with short notifications,True,"  Belleville to Orlando . Worst company ever unless you don’t mind endless delays with short notifications. Last 10 flights I’ve bought have been delayed and zero support from customer service other than “sorry, deal with it” Prices are cheap but have to pay for everything under the sun from seat selection to carry on bags",-1

This is the 2nd time I've flown Allegiant air and the 2nd time I've been thoroughly impressed. The staff in the airport were great and the flight staff was even better. Flight attendants were amazing, funny and helpful and made the very rough flight enjoyable. They calmed my nerves on the flight.",1
2018-03-21,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newburgh to Punta Gorda,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,experience with Allegiant was excellent,True,"  Newburgh to Punta Gorda. I always fly JetBlue, but because I was looking for a directl flight near to Venice FL, I chose to try Allegiant. Before my flight I read all the reviews and I was concerned since a lot of the reviews were very bad. I found my experience with Allegiant was excellent. The plane was clean (our return flight was on a brand new plane), the staff was friendly and courteous, and the pilots were professional. You have to pay for everything, but if you plan accordingly that is not a big deal. Buy some water and snacks ahead of time and enjoy your flight. Be aware that there is no WiFi which is a pain, but if you download a movie ahead of time no problem. The seats are very generic and not really that comfortable, but if you bring a cushion (as my wife did) problem solved. I would pay more for WiFi and hope that would be an option in the future.",1
2018-03-18,0.9,Business,Economy Class,Sanford /Orlando to Raleigh-Durham,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,what a great experience,True,"  Orlando to Raleigh. It was my first experience with not only the Sanford airport, but Allegiant Air as well. I wanted to say what a great experience we had, our flight attendant went above and beyond to make sure that we enjoyed our experience. She was very knowledgeable in training us with the exit row duties. It was a rather short flight so she really didn't have to check on us the way she did but we really appreciated her extra kindness.",1
2018-03-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Cedar Rapids,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,4 couples were split,True," My wife and I registered together as 2 people flying from Orlando to Cedar Rapids. Upon reviewing our seats we were given 20A and 20F. At Orlando Airport we asked if we could be seated together, Allegiant counter asked for $22 so we could move to some empty seats. Just not right. We registered as a couple. We waited until we boarded and asked an attendant. Found out the people we were next to were also split. I gave them my seat so they can be together. Upon doing so found out the individual next to my wife was also forced to split from his wife. It turned out 4 couples were split with empty seats on the flight. Happy to say we reversed what Allegiants forced seating practices tried to accomplish.",-1
2018-03-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,learned my lesson flying with Allegiant,True," Flew Omaha to Orlando. I’ve flown with Allegiant over 20 times. Every time I’ve flown, the plane has been at least an hour behind schedule. They don’t check the plane before they put you on board. Allegiant boards everyone on the plane, then checks the plane. Absolutely ridiculous. I’m currently sitting on the plane and it’s been 2 hours because of mechanical problems (like always). A light bulb is out? Are you kidding me? You should have hundreds of those on hand. I’ve learned my lesson flying with Allegiant and that is never again. Please take my word before you decide to save $100 bucks - it’s not worth it.",-1
2018-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Chattanooga,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,airline is absolutely awful,True, Flew Allegiant Air from Orlando to Chattanooga. This airline is absolutely awful no other way to put it. I've been sitting on the runway for a longer duration than my entire flight. All I can say is I will never be flying Allegiant again and I suggest you do the same if you don't want a similar experience.,-1
2018-03-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Asheville,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,unimpressed with customer service,True,"  Tampa to Asheville. A flight attendant informed me that he would ensure that my bag made it onto the plane and because he failed to do so, my luggage is now lost. As of today it has been lost for a week. When I approached Allegiant team members at the airport about it, they responded all the same and referred me to the customer care service in Las Vegas. I have tried numerous times to call customer service and the wait time varies but is no less than 45 minutes for each call. It didn’t seem to get anywhere when I called, they told me that there wasn’t much they could do. I was forced to buy an entire new wardrobe on my vacation because I had no clothes or shoes (they were in my luggage, the luggage that  Allegiant failed to load onto the plane). I am highly unimpressed with the customer service I have received in regards to Allegiant taking responsibility for losing my luggage and making the effort to contact me in regards to a refund.",-1
2018-03-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Memphis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I couldn’t get any credit,True,"  Los Angeles to Memphis. They are a struggling airline that is not business oriented. I had a 6.30am flight, arrived well before time only to be informed that the gates closed  20-30 mins earlier than it was supposed to. When I asked for assistance I was informed that I would have to call a customer service line to rebook - I waited 45 mins on hold only to be told that I would have to buy another ticket and I couldn’t get any credit. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.",-1
2018-03-07,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,it was terrible,True," Have flown Allegiant several times with no complaints. This time we had a 4 hour delay in Punta Gorda and it was terrible. Everyone was on their phones trying to reach Allegiant Air with no success. I was on hold for 76 minutes and then gave up. We were told at the airport that we would each get a $50 credit for air fare which never happened, I emailed Allegiant and was expecting a reply which also didn’t happen. I had purchased 3 round trip tickets and patiently waiting for my credit.",-1
2018-03-03,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Greenville to Tampa,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5,Prices are amazing,True,"  Greenville to Tampa. They were on time for me, fly late night, no issues getting boarded. Join 2018 and use the app for everything. Prices are amazing if you only plan on bringing a carry on. Here is the bad no free meals, no free drink and comfort is a flat 0/10. The seats dont even recline. That said you get what you pay for. If you can deal with having no space and no inflight meal or drinks unless you pay, this company wont bother you.",1
2018-02-26,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Grand Rapids,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,pay for everything separately,True,"  Orlando to Grand Rapids. This airline is certainly not worth the price of admission. They have yet to have a flight on time, always delayed. You pay for everything separately, as you would with Spirit. Will not fly with them again, even if the ticket was $25. Forgot to mention their very limited routes.",-1
2018-02-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to New Orleans,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,it’s not worth it,True," Flew Allegiant Air from Raleigh to New Orleans. Had to wait an hour and a half for check in to begin. Way too many fees for everything. Too afraid to even use the restroom because there is probably a fee associated with using the toilet paper. Barely had time to get through TSA because the counter doesn’t open until two hours before the flight leaves. Took an hour through TSA. I almost missed my flight because they are lazy and won’t work or allow people to check bags 3 hours before. Come on, you really can’t pay someone an extra hour so we can check in? I will never fly here again. Yes, the ticket was cheaper but by the time you add all the fees and time you’re waiting, it’s not worth it.",-1
2018-02-22,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montrose to Los Angeles,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,stress free and pleasant flight.,True,"  The flight crew on Allegiant are so friendly. I flew from Montrose to Los Angeles on 2/21/18- flight #361, and  the cabin crew were all very accommodating. They make flying so much more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend Allegiant if you are looking for a stress free and pleasant flight.",1
2018-02-13,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Orlando,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,attendants were wonderful,True,"  Austin to Orlando. The boarding process was clear and smooth. The cost of the flight alone is worth taking a trip. The flight attendants were wonderful, caring and thoughtful. I observed them taking care to assist each passenger who had an issue or concern. They took the time to listen. I find that so important in a society that lacks active listening. I was ill and before I even said a word, all 3 jumped in and offered assistance to help me feel better and checked on me the entire flight. The plane was clean and comfortable. I have and will continue to share my experience with others as I continue to fly Allegiant!",1
2018-02-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to St Pete Clearwater,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never be flying with them again,True,  Grand Rapids to St Pete Clearwater. Was one of the worst customer service I have ever received! They were extremely rude and it was outrageous at the tone I received from the customer service representative very inconsistent to what I had to say. The airline is not flexible at all and I will never be flying with them again!,-1
2018-01-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Phoenix Mesa,,,,,,,2,"Overall, not happy at all",True,"  Omaha to Phoenix Mesa. I am probably never booking with Allegiant again. I'm not even sure about any airlines anymore. My sister and I had plans to visit our grandparents down in Arizona mid-February, but for medical reasons they will be coming back to Omaha before then. My sister and I got in contact with customer service as soon as we heard the news, because I don't think there's really any point in going anymore. And all they're willing to do for us is give us an $86 voucher each for future travel. We each spent $300. I understand their prices are cheap, but seriously? They're going to just resell those tickets anyway. Not very accommodating or understanding at all. And it doesn't help that they only fly to about three cities total from Omaha. Overall, not happy at all.",-1
2018-01-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tri Cities to Orlando Sanford,,,,,,1.0,2,told me you should have come earlier,True,"  Tri Cities to Orlando Sanford. I will never use this airline again! Rudest customer service I have ever seen. I drove an hour to get here in the snow and arrived early to my flight (which an Allegiant employee told me last time to be 45 minutes early) and there was no one at the counter. When I finally found someone they told me you should have come earlier. We closed the booth and there’s nothing I can do. I asked to speak to someone else and they told me I’d have to wait til they came out. I asked when that would be and they just said I don’t know. No refund. No reschedule. No help. I tried to call the corporate office and after 1.5 hrs on hold I finally got the operator to switch me over to the corporate number, just to get sent to voicemail and hung up on. Needless to say corporate never called back. No respect for their customers. I’d rather spend the extra money on an airline that is actually good. Never again.",-1
2018-01-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix/Mesa to South Bend,,,,,,1.0,1,I was late getting to the airport,True,  Unfortunately traffic happens!  I was late getting to the airport and delayed getting through security and made it to the gate by last call only to have them literally shut the door on mye. They were so rude and did nothing to help me - ie rebook me on a different flight or even offer me a customer service rep to talk with. I ended up having to go to Sky Harbor and book a flight with American Airlines. I paid for two tickets and that has happened twice. The first time it was totally their fault when their plane broke down and I also forced to pay for two tickets because of their lousy customer service and limited schedule. Don’t risk it! Pay the extra money and go on a reliable carrier.,-1
2018-01-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Greater Rochester to Orlando,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,a pretty sad airline,True,"  Greater Rochester to Orlando. What a joke this airline is. Always something. Either paperwork, or luggage, or pilot over slept! Today they got out of gate late, pulled out to runway, then told us there was a route change. Don’t have enough fuel onboard, so back to the gate we go. This is a pretty sad airline.",-1
2018-01-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Niagara Falls to Punta Gorda,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,terrible customer service,True," Niagara Falls to Punta Gorda. I’ve never given anything a review good or bad. But I had to with this airline. I’ve never experienced such terrible customer service in my life. I will never fly with this airline again. Nor would I ever recommend to go with this airline. I tried to reach a representative on the phone. Over three hours of hanging up and calling back being on hold for over an hour each time I finally gave up. My flight was canceled which is fine and understandable due to weather. Representative said I could extend my trip an extra day but that is impossible since they only fly out on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday. No reimbursement for the day lost. Also I could’ve waited to the last minute and paid $100 less than what I had originally paid for my flight. If I could give them less than one star I would. Also uploaded a screenshot of one of my calls how long I was on hold. Do not go with this airline",-1
2018-01-12,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to St. Pete-Clearwater,,,,,,,5,best experience with phone customer service,True,"  I had the best experience with the phone customer service lady Phyllis who was so kind and patient with me about an upcoming trip.

We had a 7am flight and arrived at 5:30 am only to be told the flight was delayed until 12:30pm. We were irritated, but knew stuff happens. But no, it then gets delayed to 3pm and then 3:40pm. Over 8 hours, no excuse for that. And an $8 food voucher. That will get me a bottle of water at the airport.",-1
2017-12-27,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Greensboro to Saint Petersburg,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3,never on time,True, Greensboro to Saint Petersburg. I have flown Allegiant many times since I’ve moved to Florida and I will tell you - this year has been the worst. Never on time. Never. You board the plane when you’re supposed to be leaving and the people at the ticket counter have no idea what they are doing. I’m considering paying extra just to be guaranteed the right time and efficiency.,-1
2017-12-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Provo to Mesa,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,not worth the cheap price,True, Provo to Mesa. Every time I have flown with Allegiant my flight has been delayed or inconvenienced in some way. In January my flight was delayed by 8 hours and my most recent flight the time changed 4 times. It's not worth the cheap price if you don't get to where you're needing to go to. The staff aren't horrible but the company is awful.,-1
2017-12-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,not a single enjoyable moment,True,"  Booked a flight to Las Vegas out of Bellingham for this past Sunday, December 17th, we had to select a 2:45 departure losing half our day. Once boarded our flight 1812 we were met with mechanical issues. We were left sitting on the Tarmac for a while before they started de-boarding. Once inside we had to wait for further updates. Once they finally updated us they offered free pop and water. The  pilot was speaking to a passenger as she was exiting the airport, explaining she left her number and was going to the hotel. This was after 2 hours of sitting in the boarding area. Maybe an hour after the pilot left they finally made an announcement saying that we will be delayed until 9PM! At first they said no one could leave and return because TSA would be leaving. When asked if they could at least give the smokers a designated area on the Tarmac they hadn't even considered we have been at the airport since 12PM and would be landing in Las Vegas if your planes were taken care of and were reliable. Regular maintenance and planes on standby for these situations is part of the customer experience. They finally offered a 8$ voucher for Scotty Browns Social House where the going rate for anything is 15$ - some people had children and once at the restaurant I heard an older couple talking about their finances and ultimately went the entire day without food. When another plane arrived coming from Las Vegas the seating was different and those who paid for select seating we're told to expect a refund as we were now sitting in cramped conditions on hard flight chairs next to strangers. Even though they sat my friend alone where one of us could have sat with her and when asked if one of us could move to the empty chair they told us no. Once boarded it still took us an hour to get moving, making our departure for 10:30PM meaning we won't arrive in Las Vegas until well into 12:00 AM. They didn't even offer free snacks and beverages aboard your plane. We were told we would receive a $50 voucher towards our next flight and a refund on assigned seating on December 17th and it is currently December 21st and have yet to receive any further correspondence. As it stands I won't be flying Allegiant anymore.  The worst part of this is the fact that I lost show tickets and had to still pay for the hotel I didn't arrive at until 1 am. I understand things happen and they ensured we got to our destination safely. I also understand that some things are out of the airline control and there is a lot that goes on behind closed doors that the passengers may not be aware of.  I could take this experience as a one off but my returning flight was also delayed. There was not a single enjoyable moment with this trip.",-1
2017-12-01,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Phoenix to Minot,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,just improve your service,True," 
Flew Allegiant Air from Phoenix to Minot. TSA took over an hour to process everyone and they still let the plane leave. We got to the gate at 6.46 and plane leaves at 7 and they wouldn’t let us on. We could still see people boarding but they didn’t budge. So now we have to rebook for a different day since they don’t really care how you make it home. My checked bag will be sitting in Minot for days. The lady behind the counter “helping” people was the cherry on top. She was incredibly rude, and basically just repeated the mantra of not their problem. So for a friendly $75 charge I was able to rebook a flight. After she railed 20 people in line saying that we need to be here 3 hours early. I could fly out of O’Hare and not need to be there three hours early. What makes you think I’m going to get to the airport at 3.45am for a flight at Phoenix Mesa airport. Maybe just improve your service, and don’t fly 9 flights out between 6.30 and 7.30 when there isn’t enough support staff to handle over 1200 people coming through TSA. Never again.",-1
2017-11-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Sanford Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,$50 or they wouldn’t take my bag,True,"  Pittsburgh to Sanford Orlando. Honestly the worst airline in the world. I sat in line for 2 hours just to check bags. There wasn’t even anyone at the counter because they said they don’t check in until 2 hours before boarding starts. Boarding started at 2:45 no one showed up until 1:30. I had rush to get through security and barely made it to Gate in time. Even the stewardesses were disrespectful. I paid $20 to check my bag online and thy had no record of it when I got there and I had to pay another $50 or they wouldn’t take my bag. Then it was apparently 8 pounds overweight and I was faced with pulling everything apart or paying an additional $50 for the baggage after waiting 2 hours in line with a 2 year old and a 6 year old. I asked to speak to a supervisor. The excuse, no one at any counters works for Allegiant. You can’t even get a cup of ice for your children, they charge for everything!",-1

Would not accept my checked bags that I already paid $40 for. I arrived at the counter 47 mins before the flight took off. Although the website says you have to be there 45 mins before the flight they wouldnt accept them, and then made me pay $100 at the gate to check them. Ridiculous service, I will never fly Allegiant again and I suggest no one does.",-1
2017-11-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Springfield to Destin-Fort Walton Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Extremely poor customer service,True,"  Springfield to Destin. Extremely poor customer service. I was asked to put my bag in a slot when walking in. My bag did not fit completely in the slot so I was asked to pay $50.00. Once I sat down I slid my bag under the seat in front of me and it fitted perfect just like the passengers on both sides of me who paid zero. I sent Allegiant the pictures confirming that my bag fitted and asked for a refund, however, after 2 months of asking I receive a generic email saying that they will not refund my money. I am baffled that they will not even look at the pictures and treat me like a human being. Customer service is going down the drain and issues like this confirm it.",-1
2017-11-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Eugene to Mesa,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,cannot take off on time,True,  Eugene to Mesa. Allegiant cannot take off on time. Their flights are delayed 2-4 hours 50% of the time because of maintenance. Their investment in new planes has not paid off. Allegiant has made over one billion dollars since inception and they cannot be on time. Very disappointing!,-1
2017-11-17,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Punta Gorda,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,definitely fly again with Allegiant,False,"  Providence to Punta Gorda.

I read some reviews online I was a little apprehensive about booking but I would definitely fly again with Allegiant Air - great experience and refer all my family and friends.",1
2017-11-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Las Vegas, NV to Fresno, CA",2.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,was a living nightmare,False,"  I swear I wouldn't use Allegiant Air if they weren't the only airline to fly to my hometown. The trip from Las Vegas to Fresno was great. However the flight from Fresno to Las Vegas was a living nightmare. Flight was delayed (no problem, flights are always delayed), this wasn't any delay it went from 1 hour to 3 hour to 7 hour to cancelled. I sat at the airport for 10 hours without any communication and no one knowing what was happening. It was horrible. I managed to get home the next day on the first flight out. This is when I got upset, I received $350 in vouchers because what happen. I go to try and use them and only $150 work. I called the customer service (he was rude when he answered the phone) and he told me that they were all applied to my account. But I have 3 emails and all they can say is that it was an error.",-1

The service and communication with this airline is terrible. Our flight was delayed about 6 hours, but that was not communicated to us. The pilot said everything was fine, but then we were told to get off the plane. We sat and waited for a new pilot for hours. The staff was not friendly in the least. After we had went and bought our own snacks because we were starving, they put out a few snacks for us. Not sure why it takes 3 hours to put out some sodas and pretzels. Guess that shows how organized they are! Will not fly with Allegiant ever again.",-1

I rate them done with Spirit. Try to give them another shot and they blew it. Can't even place our 4 kids together on a trip. Employees are rude and if one tries to be helpful, the manager ""corrects"" their actions. This is why I fly Delta for work.",-1
2017-11-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Horrible customer service,False,  Flew Allegiant from San Antonio to Las Vegas. The airline industry is a high reliability organization. Allegiant acted very unreliably today - how? For starters their communication with the affected passengers was very poor and they don't have a very good standard operating procedures to accommodate their customers and I don't trust them with our future travel plans. Use a different airline if you can. The flight was supposed to leave at 8.01 pm. At 7.45 they told us there was a problem with the plane. At 8.30 they told us the plane had been cleared but we couldn’t board for another 30 min. I️ went to go and find a drink and on my way back other passengers were headed my way saying the flight was delayed until 12.30. About 9.30 we looked up at the board and it now says 1.30. They didn’t even tell us. The staff were back behind the counter joking and laughing. Then they come on the intercom and say they have ordered pizza’s and it will be here in an hour. Horrible customer service. Very unreliable planes. I will never trust them with my travel plans again.,-1
2017-11-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Las Vegas,3.0,,4.0,,,2.0,4,acted very unreliable today,False,"  Austin to Las Vegas. Flight was supposed to depart at 7:45pm, at 1:30 am the airline announces that the rescue plane is not coming and that we needed to get our luggage and head to hotel. Some immediately moved to get their luggage only to find out that they could no longer enter terminal as TSA was gone for the night. Yet the desk clerk did not say that. Thank goodness we stayed because we wanted more info on hotel and new flight plan. We then find out that our flight was rescheduled for next day at 6:29 pm so we ask about hotel and they start handing out vouchers so they give us one for Hilton Airport - my wife and I decide to purchase a flight on another carrier so I'm on my phone doing this when we find out that we now have to take a shuttle to main terminal only to find out that once there the shuttle to hotel was no longer running, by now it's almost 3am. So I decide I'm going to uber our way there. We get to Hilton only to find out that they only had 10 rooms available that were already assigned to others and the airline sent too many over to them. We call the airline and they tell us to go to Best Western so we uber here and finally get to room at 3:50 am. Now we're getting ready to try this again so please pray for us. New airline Frontier so hopefully it goes better. The airline industry is a high reliability organization. Allegiant acted very unreliable today - how? for starters their communication with the affected passengers was very poor and they don't have very good standard operating procedures to accommodate their customers and I don't trust them with our future travel plans. Use a different airline if you can.",-1
2017-11-07,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Harrisburg to Clearwater,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,4,Happy with Allegiant!,False,  Price was good overall even though we pay for bags. A lot less than major carriers and it gets me from Harrisburg to Clearwater in a little over 2 hours. Major airlines have a stop in Charlotte or Atlanta and flying takes all day. This flight and one 6 months ago was on time and even early to arrive. I can sit in a small seat for 2 hours and bring my own drink or snack. Happy with Allegiant!,1
2017-11-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"St. Petersburg, FL to Asheville, NC",2.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,little communication for the delay,False,"  We flew from St. Petersburg, FL to Asheville, NC to start our honeymoon on October 29th, 2017. We were scheduled to arrive at 5.09 pm and had dinner reservations for 8.30 pm. Our flight boarded a little late and we then sat on the plane for an hour and a half with little communication for the delay, until we had been sitting in the cabin for well over an hour. A part on the plane had been identified as bad, and had to be repaired or replaced. Approaching an hour and 45 minutes we were told to deplane. We sat in the lobby and were told there was no way to tell if we were still flying our that night, as no replacement plane was available. After persistent questioning from dozens of passengers we were told they were trying to repair the plane we originally were assigned. The staff at the ticket counter claimed they had no knowledge of anything else, or any plans Allegiant had for us. Another few hours passed. We then learned that Allegiant could not fly our after 10.00 pm. Some passengers left to rent cars and drive the 9 hour trip to Asheville, where it had just started snowing. One lady was scheduled for urgent medical treatment the next morning. Approaching 9.00 pm the staff gave us $8 in food vouchers for the food court and then announced we would be boarding another airplane in about 15 minutes. The food court was rushed and the staff were overwhelmed with orders while we began boarding the plane. The flight attendants knew nothing about the airplane, read instructions from a tablet and asked the pilot if they had to announce the instructions for a water landing since we were flying over land! They had to try the light switches on the light panel as they were unfamiliar with the plane and did not know where the floatation devices were located (the seats were marked that the floatation devices were under the seats, think about the safety ramifications of that). We heard these conversations from the second row. Enroute, the attendants on the flight told us they would provide us free water and soft drinks for our inconvenience. We finally arrived in Asheville close to 11.00 pm, and missed our honeymoon dinner. We got to bed at 2.00 am. We flew back to St. Pete on November 5th on the return Allegiant trip. The flight was scheduled to leave at 8.00 am. We boarded an hour late due to another mechanical issue, this time necessitating an oil change for a generator with a temperature gauge issue. We finally took off after 10.00 am with a mechanic flying in the cockpit to monitor the situation. In talking with frequent Allegiant fliers this happens all the time. So if you want to arrive on time, choose a different airline. P.S. We lost a half day of our honeymoon and a several hundred dollar dinner. Allegiant gave us $50 each in vouchers to have the experience again!",-1
2017-11-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Austin,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,never fly this airline,False," Sure, I saved money on the cost of the flight from Orlando to Austin but Allegiant did everything else wrong on this return trip. Flight was canceled / delayed, with no info on when it would take off. Booked another flight out that day, but had to rent a car in order to make it home. Cost me an additional $250 and 10 extra hours to get to my destination, due to Allegiant's incompetence. Never fly this airline.",-1
2017-11-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,1,flight 6 hours delayed,False, The flight from Bellingham to Las Vegas was 6 hours delayed and all they gave us was free soda and an $8 vouture for food. Not happy with Allegiant. I missed my best friends engagement because of this. There was a flight to Vegas a few hours after the time mine was scheduled and instead of putting everyone that was on the earlier flight on the very next one and pushing that one back a bit so everyone only had to wait a few hours they had the earlier flight wait 6 hours. Not happy and would not recommend. I missed out on a very important moment in my best friends life because of this.,-1

I was zone 2 and my husband zone 4 and they made us wait until everyone gets in. Plus they charge you for a carry on, this never happened to me before. They put 2 people on the same seat, super frustrated right now this is the worst company ever.",-1

When I printed my boarding pass for tomorrow, today, we were not seated together. I called and the first person hung up on me and the second person reiterated that they changed aircraft and someone else purchased my seat. Even though it was purchased long after I purchased mine, their computer system is unable to assign the same seats. They refused to see if their boarding passes have been printed and just told me that I must accept the new seat assignment. I give one star because they will get you to the destination. But the seats are terrible and do not recline, the people are nice, but this brings discount airline to a new low.",-1
2017-10-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Medford,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,2,the last time I fly Allegiant,False,"  Los Angeles to Medford. Horrible service at boarding in LA, in Medford the boarding crew was excellent. Planes are garbage, it's like being on a Schoolbus with wings. With added fees for carry on bags, for a little more you can fly a better carriers. This will be the last time I fly Allegiant.",-1
2017-10-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to Las Vegas,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,3,getting what you pay for,False," You are getting what you pay for. Sure, the flight from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas was cheap but their plans are never on time and typically have “maintenance issues.” I do not recommend flying with them unless it is your last resort. It would have been much more helpful to know that the plane was delayed sooner than 20 minutes after the scheduled boarding time.",-1

The Allegiant Air baggage check in is only open a certain time before boarding. So while you watch everyone on Delta and Southwest check their bags 2 hours before their flight, you sit and wait for someone to show up. Don’t plan on getting there early and relaxing because with Allegiant, that’s not an option.",-1
2017-10-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Reno to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,so unprofessional,False, I will never fly with this airline ever again! Worst service from staff and they were no help. Had to be in Vegas by 8pm and got delayed twice. Pretty much a wasted trip and they wouldn't even try to help my friend and I out to maybe get on a different flight. I tried calling them and was on hold for way too long. I should have read the reviews before I booked with this airline. Everything about the service from them was so unprofessional. It's the Walmart of airlines,-1
2017-10-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,2,"never had any issues, until this particular trip",False,"  Flew Allegiant Air from Columbus to Fort Lauderdale. I fly with this airline almost every month, due to my mother living in Florida, and, of course, the cost is typically much cheaper than other airlines. I've never had any issues, until this particular trip, when I was charged $100 to bring my daughter and I's luggage onto the aircraft. Mind you, I have never been charged, ever. The lady which charged me, stated there was no one, other than herself, which could stand as a manager to speak with me instead. She was beyond rude when I informed her of my frustration. She stated she could do nothing for me, and proceeded to slam my card back down onto the counter, after charging me. Again, I have never had any issues previously to this trip, but, at this point, I'm set back because of the faculty.",1
2017-09-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Belleville to Jacksonville,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,2,never use this airline again,False,"  Belleville to Jacksonville . Abandoned passengers in Jacksonville FL 36 hrs before any other airline canceled due to Irma. I can forgive the 'charge for everything', I dealt with the seats that don't recline, I even looked past paying for a drink of water, but abandoning passengers that are facing a hurricane is inexcusable. They canceled the flight from Jacksonville FL to St Louis 36 hours before the airport shut down. All other airlines flying out of JAX that day completed their flights out. The weather was actually beautiful that day. They had even sent the 'check in online' the previous day, so we thought we were set. By the time we got the cancellation notice (about 4 hours before our flight), there were no other flights to be booked there or at any other airport within 300 miles. Fortunately, we had not quite made it to the airport, so we kept our rental car and drove all the way back to St Louis, through all the other evacuee traffic. Spent a total of 22 hrs in the car. We made it just fine, in spite of the add'l $500 in rental car fees, $200 in hotel charges, meal expenses, fuel, etc. What really is upsetting is the 'what if' questions.  If the storm had been 12 or even 24 hours away, I would understand better, but Irma did not hit that area until Sunday night. Our flight was due to leave around 1pm on Friday. I cannot verify this, but it may be Allegiant did not want to pay to send an empty plane down to JAX to pick us up. The message we received claimed they canceled the flight due to passenger safety.  JAX airport did not close until 7pm Sat night, according to the airport website. We will never use this airline again. I don't care how cheap their flights are.",-1
2017-09-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Columbus,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not recommend them to anyone,False,"  I was supposed to fly Allegiant home from Fort Lauderdale to Columbus yesterday. I was on a cruise that returned to Miami on Thursday with limited wi-fi. On Wednesday, I was made aware that my flight had been canceled due to the storm coming in. I tried to get on an earlier flight (Thursday instead of Friday) to Cincinnati but that was also cancelled. Allegiant prematurely cancelled several flights, leaving thousands of customers in harms way. I was lucky to be able to get on a last-minute flight through Delta who was bringing in extra planes instead of cancelling flights to help get people out of the dangerous area. This was my first experience with Allegiant and as a result, I would not recommend them to anyone. Have piece of mind and book Delta or another reputable airline, even if it costs you more.",-1
2017-09-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Springfield to Orlando,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,it's all about hidden fees,False,"  Springfield, MO to Orlando FL with Allegiant Air. If you had a disability or need to transport a medical device you will be charged at the gate for this. In my case I had a very small compact CPAP machine and a very small back backpack as my personal item. I was charged $50 by the gate agent in Springfield MO, for and additional carry on for the medical device. They don't care about the ADA, nor do they care about pleasing the customer, it's all about hidden fees and extra charges applied toward the customer. I wrote him to Allegiant customer service and got a camned answer a month later, saying they were not going to do anything about it.",-1
2017-09-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Youngstown,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the cabin crew allowed us to sit together,False,  Flew Orlando to Youngstown. On a plane that was only 3/4 full Allegiant Air decides to seat my wife in the front of the plane and me in the rear. Why? So they can charge additional fees for seat selection. $9-$23 per person. That's $18 to $46 if my wife and I wanted to sit together on a flight I book for us both at the same time on the same credit card. You just can't justify that. We refused to pay the counter girl who had no empathy. Thankfully the cabin crew allowed us to sit together in one of the many empty groups of seats. I won't ever consider this nickel and dime airline again. Even if the flight was advertised as free. By the time your finished with their nickel and dime tricks you could have flown on a real airline.,-1
2017-08-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Denver,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Allegiant Air tops it for the worst,False,"  I thought Frontier was bad but Allegiant Air tops it for the worst. Flew Cincinnati to Denver. $100 carry-on fee. Absolutely terrible. I feel sorry for the people that have to work for this airline, it is the bottom of the barrel. Once is enough to realize it's worth the extra $20 to fly a real airline.",-1

I had completely different experiences at the airports. Fort Wayne had amazing staff and were very accommodating! Once I got PIE it was a completely terrible experience! Fort Wayne has great staff and the manager there was exceptional! St. Petersburg could really learn customer service skills! My ratings are only applied to Fort Wayne.,1
2017-08-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Las Vegas,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,My vacation was ruined,False,  Cincinnati to Las Vegas. Worst experience of traveling I have had! First the plane supposedly had to be downgraded so everyone's seats were wrong and my husband's extra leg room was not available. Then they lost our luggage for the entire trip apparently couldn't find it when I spoke with them on 8/18 and 8/20 (since we got an email that we also had a downgrade for our flight back) and then when I got to the airport they wouldn't let us board until they got a certain amount of volunteers to fly out the next day So we were late to take off. Then I stopped at the baggage area when we finally landed in Ohio again to check on our luggage and found out that they logged our baggage as found in Denver on 8/18 and no attempt was made to contact us at all. We wasted $200 on clothes and supplies in vegas that shouldn't have been. I still haven't gotten refunded for my leg space seats or luggage checked fees for both travel there and back or any communication about when I will be getting it. Instead I get requests for reviews and deals for our next flight. I will never fly this airline again. They don't even have a scanning system for their bags checked. You get what you paid for when buying a cheap flight through an airline with nobody knowing who they are but lesson learned. Do not fly them ever! Save the stress. My vacation was ruined and so stressful,-1
2017-08-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pasco WA to Las Vegas NV,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,expect delays with Allegiant Air,False,"  This is the 3rd time in 12 weeks I've have flown with Allegiant. One flight cancelled and two delayed for four hours or greater. The first time being 6 hours with a child in tow and the second time being 4 hours. To compensate our first flight they gave us each a 50 dollar voucher (hardly compares to the 6 hour wait time). The second flight there has been no compensation! Allegiant is known to be delayed 30 minutes but my past two experiences has combined for a total of 10 hours in delays. I don't fly to be delayed, I fly to get to my destination on time. Allegiant has proven this is not a priority to them when they do not even explain to their passengers why we are delayed. Two 50 dollar vouchers for two poor flight experiences is hardly worth it. Either fly someone else or expect delays with Allegiant Air. There is a reason the prices are so low.",-1
2017-08-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sanford to Louisville,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,expect delays with Allegiant,False,"  Sanford to Louisville. This is the 2nd time my wife and I have flown with Allegiant in the past month. Both times our flight has been delayed for a few hours. The first time being 6 hours and the second time being 2 hours. Both times we were on the plane/boarding and we were told to get off without any explanation. To compensate our first flight they gave us each a 50 dollar voucher (hardly compares to the 6 hour wait time). The second flight there has been no compensation! Allegiant is known to be delayed 30 minutes but my past two experiences has combined for a total of 8 hours in delays. I dont fly to be delayed, I fly to get to my drstination on time. Allegiant has proved this is not a priority to them when they do not even explain to their passengers why we are delayed. Two 50 dollar vouchers for two poor flight experiences is hardly worth it.

2017-08-21,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Harrisburg to Orlando Sanford,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,Overall great experience,False,"  Harrisburg to Orlando Sanford. Could not have been more happy with the experience from use of app for boarding, to the airport and then the plane. It was my son's first flight and he couldn't have had a better time. Yes, you have to pay extra for baggage and seat selection (as you do with most airlines now), but with the low airfares, it is still cheaper! The staff and pilots were extraordinary. The A320 we flew home in was practically brand new (they are moving towards an all Air Bus fleet). Flights were on time, no delays - arrived at destinations early. Also rented car through Allegiant and all I needed was the app on my phone to pick up. Overall great experience and will fly Allegiant again.",1
2017-08-19,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,3.0,2.0,,1.0,2,You get what you pay for,False,"  Syracuse to Myrtle Beach. When the aircraft turned on, a loud constant high pitch noise occurred for a long period of time and it was ongoing until dimmed when we left the ground. The seats do not recline and the temperature was freezing cold on the plane; you could see customers bundled up from head to toe all throughout the aircraft. In addition, the flight was  delayed 3 hours before departure due to a gas spill. There were no updates over the intercom during the delay so confusion and frustration increased for customers. The one positive comment I have is the flight attendants were friendly and accommodating during a family members plane sickness. However, I do not recommend if there are other airline choices. You get what you pay for.",-1
2017-08-18,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Missoula to Oakland,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,just say no to Allegiant,False," This is my second-and last time-I will ever bother with booking Allegiant. The flight was 2 hours late arriving in and leaving from Missoula. I was in one of the airport concessions and was visiting with the person working there. She said that this was not an isolated incident-this flight is delayed on a weekly basis. I chose Allegient because I could get a cheap round trip flight to Montana. But once the carry on baggage fees, the cost of buying a seat assignment, the taxes and the weekly parking cost of leaving my car at an inconvenient airport because Allegient only flies out of off-the-beaten-track airports, turns out the price is comparable to flying just about any other airline. I'm 5'7"" and my knees hit the seat in front of me. There is nothing free on Allegient-no beverages or snacks unless you buy them. Just say no to Allegiant.",-1
2017-08-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Punta Gorda,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,book with someone else,False," Not worth my time or money. My Allegiant Air flight from Cleveland to Punta Gorda was delayed for 7 hours! We were given a $50 voucher for a later flight booking, but I was told that I would have to cancel my return flight to use the voucher for that. I cancelled my return flight, but they would not refund my credit card, they just issued a second travel voucher for a future flight. I'll probably not be flying within the year and it will expire, and certainly not with Allegiant. Passengers were given a food voucher, but then told by the vendors that they don't accept Allegiant vouchers because they don't pay them back. Book with someone else. Seriously. You have been warned!",-1

I bought these tickets for my son and for my mother to bring him back after spending summer in wisconsin and I have never been so irritated with an airline. Yes, cheap tickets not worth the delay and stress. The plane was supposed to leave at 9am they left at 1/.45pm were on and off the plane 4 times before actually leaving. I tried calling customer service to see what the hold up is and waiting 50 min and still no answer from a real person. Never again will we fly with them.",-1
2017-08-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Pittsburgh,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,so rude right from the start,False,"  New Orleans to Pittsburgh. I have flown Allegiant three round-trips. Delayed or canceled every time. I used them more than once because they are the only airline with nonstop service from New Orleans to Pittsburgh. This latest experience was the worst. My boyfriend was visiting from Australia. We booked a flight on Allegiant to Pittsburgh to visit my sister. At 4am I get a text that the flight was canceled. No reason why. I called to see what they can do for us and spent almost an hour on hold. I finally get through to someone who was so rude right from the start. She would not help with hotel vouchers (we had to be out of our vacation rental that night and had another one booked for when we returned). I asked her to transfer me to her manager/supervisor, she said she didn't have one and disconnected me. I spent another hour on hold to get through to someone else (much kinder than the first but not great). She gave me the option of flying to another city and driving to Pittsburgh but could not give me a refund. I had to call back to confirm if we would take this option because I had to talk with my sister and my boyfriend. We decided to do fly to the other city but they refused give us any kind of voucher or discount for a rental car. The new flight for Cleveland was delayed as well. Neither the ticket counter to the counter at the gate had anyone there. Our flight home was delayed and the flight attendants on both flights were horribly obnoxious and rude. They issued a$100 voucher for our inconvenience but I did not find that acceptable considering how awful the ordeal was. I emailed several times, no answer. I called (with another 30 minutes on hold) to be told that I had to email my complaint. It has been 3 months and still no responses.",-1
2017-07-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Provo,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,it's like a circus,False," Allegiant Air flights are cheap, but their planes are never ready, and you aren't going to depart on time. They prepare for take off. Then, taxi to the runway. Then, return to the gate. Then, do a computer reset. Then, Prepare for take off again. Every time I've flown them, it's like a circus. Here's an idea: How about checking the plane before departure?",-1
2017-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Cincinnati,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,the seats were extremely cramped,False,"  I flew from Austin, Texas to Cincinnati, Ohio through Allegiant. I chose Allegiant because they have a non-stop flight from Austin to Cincinnati and it seemed convenient. When I got to Cincinnati my flight landed at 10.33pm. I left the gate and immediately went to baggage claim and double checked with the Allegiant that I was waiting in the right spot. It took a minute for me to get their attention because the employees were in mid conversation with each other. I waited for about an hour and a half and began to get worried because that's a long time to be waiting for a bag. So at around midnight I went to the Allegiant help desk but there was no one there. I was able to chase down one of the employees as they were leaving to go home I imagine and she was very short and irritated that I was asking about my bag. I have flown a lot and I've never had to wait for a bag for so long so naturally I was worried. One of the other employees was walking by with my bag headed towards the desk so I went and claimed it and asked her where it was. She also was very irritated and said ""I pulled it off the carousel"" and walked away. The staff were very rude, the seats were extremely cramped, and waiting for a bag for an hour and a half is ridiculous. I chose Allegiant because the non-stop flight was convenient but I will never fly with them again based solely on how rude the desk help was and the long wait for my luggage. I will gladly pay the extra money through a different airline.",-1
2017-07-25,0.4,Business,Economy Class,Belleville to Punta Gorda,3.0,,2.0,,,5.0,3,issued me a baggage credit,False,"  Belleville to Punta Gorda. Allegiant issued me a baggage credit in Nov 2016. Went to use credit and it is hidden in a drop down arrow where you need yo type it in. If you do not click the drop down arrow, you will never have the opportunity to type in the voucher credit. It is very easy to over look. Appears the intent if Allegiant. If they wanted you to use it, they would make it visible with out having to click the down arrow. This is what happeed to us. We booked anyway due to we did not want to lose the price. Called customer service, takes 45 minutes to 1 hour to speak to a representative. Once through, they said it was too late and thanked me for my donation as they would not re-issue my voucher.",-1
2017-07-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline I have flown,False,  Kansas City to Las Vegas. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Flight delayed both ways for hours. Could not get bags from airport for almost two hours- supervisor refused to explain why or even meet with people. Customer service representatives were rude and used foul language when interacting with customers. Maintenance issues on the second flight - kept telling us 15 more minutes -- no air -- rudest flight attendants I have ever encountered.,-1
2017-07-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Baltimore,,,,,,,1,I won't be using them again,False,"  Tulsa to Baltimore. I paid roughly $214 for my upcoming flight to include cancellation insurance. Sure enough, I had to cancel and received a voucher of $131! Not only did I not get my money back but they gave me a voucher for only a percentage of what I paid. What was the point in purchasing insurance? Their website wasn't working when I originally tried to book my flight online so I called to make my reservation. After waiting on hold for 46 minutes at 10:00 at night I someone finally answered and I was charged $30 to book over the phone.  I won't be using them again!",-1
2017-07-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Tampa Bay,2.0,,,,,1.0,1,Horrible customer service,False,"  Arrived at Pittsburgh early this morning for flight scheduled to Tampa Bay. We boarded the plane and after a long delay, all passengers were asked to exit the plane. Allegiant staff alerted passengers to expect an hour delay. After several hours of waiting, they cancelled the flight! They stayed we could pick up our baggage up downstairs and that they would not be rescheduling the flight. Horrible customer service. Do not use this airline.",-1
2017-07-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Pete–Clearwater to Asheville,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no plans to ever fly Allegiant again,False,"  St. Pete–Clearwater to Asheville. My most recent trip was scheduled to depart Asheville at 6:45pm on Monday and was rescheduled for 12:00pm on Tuesday. Due to the fact that I had several Tuesday morning work meetings planned, the Tuesday option was no option at all, so I had to rent a car and drive from AVL to ATL to catch a flight with an airline that has a better track record for getting people where they need to go in a timely manner. For the costs of a rental car from AVL to ATL, the costs of a last minute Delta flight, the costs of my time, and the expense of my sanity, I could probably have flown Delta First Class for all of my previous Allegiant flights and still have come out ahead. While the automatic $100 voucher is a nice gesture (that nowhere near covers the actual cost of the incident) I am afraid I have very little use for a $100 voucher to fly on an airline I have zero confidence in. It is such a certainty of negative experience, that I feel guilty even gifting this voucher to an enemy. Unless there is a full overhaul of what has become the very worst airline I have ever dealt with, I have no plans to ever fly Allegiant again.",-1
2017-07-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Eugene,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,you get what you pay for,False, Allegiant is the worst airline I have ever flown on. Pay the extra money to get a flight that is actually on-time. My flight from Eugene to Los Angeles was delayed almost 4 hours. Then my flight back was delayed as well. They don't tell you until after the flight is supposed to leave that its being delayed either. None of the staff realize whats going on. Terrible air service. You get what you pay for. Do not use this airline unless you feel like waiting endlessly at the airport,-1
2017-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Punta Gorda, FL to Knoxville, TN",2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the worst flight I have ever experienced,False,"  Undoubtedly the worst flight I have ever experienced. We experienced three departure delays, for various aircraft-related mechanical problems, which made our departure 6 hours late as well as our arrival in Knoxville. Allegiant Air, as required by FAA regulations, provided us 1 cup of warm water (during our last delay while sitting on the tarmac), and approximately a 2-ounce serving of Chex mixed with two tiny pretzels. Allegiant Air's website stated the flight departed at 12.00 noon, and arrived at 3.45pm. The stewardess stated we would receive vouchers from Allegiant Air, which I did tonight. They are for $50, are valid only for a future flight on Allegiant Air, and must be redeemed within 1 year. They are the only airline that flies that route - a 1 hour 40 minute flight, and would not have another flight for three more days. Their required policy submitted to the FAA states that they do not compensate excessive delays, which does seem to comply with Federal regulations. They classify delays resulting from mechanical problems as ""a delay resulting from situations beyond their control"" such as would be severe weather, control tower equipment problems, etc. My previous experiences with Allegiant Air had delays of usually about 1 hour, but the savings seemed to justify those delays. Their seat configurations favor adults with less than a 30"" inseam. I cannot envision flying this airline again except under the most extreme circumstances. Even then I cringe at the thought. No amount of savings are worth what we endured.",-1
2017-07-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,horrible customer service ,False,"  Asheville to Baltimore. Beyond horrible customer service and ridiculous delays. Will never be flying this airline again. The cheap cost of the ticket doesn't make up for how horrible this airline is. Flight was delayed over 7 hours, they gave us an $8 meal voucher which wasn't even enough to buy a decent meal. Offered tiny cans of soda and water. Can't say enough negative things about them. Don't waste your money and more importantly don't waste your time.",-1
2017-07-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Peoria to Phoenix–Mesa,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,I'm done flying with this company,False," I don't think there is ever one flight that I have flown with Allegiant that hasn't had some sort of problem or delay. This airline is an absolute joke. I'm currently sitting at the airport right now going on a two hour delay from Peoria to Phoenix–Mesa. There was a malfunction and a mechanic was needed, so we then get the word that the mechanic is one hour away. Over an an hour went by then got word the mechanic was on site and still currently waiting to see when we are going to be leaving. After this trip, I'm done flying with this company. Never again.",-1
2017-07-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Austin,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,not be using this airline again,False,"  Cincinnati to Austin. I was excited about the cheap price but it doesn't make up for how bad the customer service was. The Allegiant employees working around the terminal were unprofessional and rude. When I asked the guy at the gate a question about whether I could purchase an 'early boarding' pass at the gate, he seemed flustered and then rude and eventually just blew me off. I was trying to make an additional purchase and he turned me away for some reason. When I arrived in Cincinnati the Allegiant folks took 60 minutes to start loading our stuff onto the baggage claim thing.  I will not be using this airline again, even with the cheap price..",-1
2017-07-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Rosa to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,do not fly this airline,False,"  Santa Rosa to Las Vegas. Spend a few more dollars and do not fly this airline. We have had 2 experiences with this airline and both have been horrible in more than just one way. Our flight got cancelled just like that a week before the flight, still working on getting our money back. First experience included almost 2 hours of departure delay without given an apology or explanation, on the way back we waited one hour inside the plane before the plane took off. Customer service not so compassionate or understanding of any issue or even get our own money back.",-1
2017-07-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sioux Falls to Las Vegas,3.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1,most horrible experience,False,"  We had the most horrible experience with Allegiant Air. First off we were delayed from Sioux Falls to Las Vegas. They loaded the plane and we stayed on there for an hour before we had to deplane. Two hours later they told us that we were stranded for the night. They said they were going to give us vouchers for rooms, and then after an hour waiting they didn't have any vouchers. So we were all forced to front $250. The next day we were supposed to leave from Sioux Falls at 1248 and we were delayed until after 3.30pm. Finally arrived almost 24 hours later. Then on our return we were delayed 2 hrs again and then when we arrived we were stuck on the runway for an hour, due to not enough staff to unload the plane.",-1
2017-07-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Idaho Falls,,,,,,1.0,3,nobody would help me out,False,"  Los Angeles to Idaho Falls. I am an adoptive mother of two boys (5 yrs old) and (8 yrs old). They have two full blood brothers. (18 yrs) and (11 yrs) and we decided it would be fun to have them come stay with us for a week during the summer. The brothers live in Anaheim and I saw the tickets on Allegiant Air for a very good price out of Los Angeles so I booked them. They have never been on an airplane before, but they are 18 yrs old and 11 yrs old so I thought everything would be just fine. They arrived at the LAX airport 2.5 hours early and checked in just fine, I received an email stating they checked in, bags were checked in. I guess they got held up in security, when they got to the front of the security line they told them they had 13 minutes to get to their flight. After they were done being searched they had 3 minutes to get to the flight. They asked the TSA staff where the gate was and he told these boys to go to the gate in the opposite direction, so they missed the flight. They  did not have a phone and had to borrow a phone to try to find someone to drive 3 hours back to get them. How do you check in 2 boys and not make sure they are on the plane? While I am sitting here in Idaho waiting for them, I get a message telling me they are not on the flight, and they do not know where they went. I was in the Idaho Falls airport and I asked the security guard if he could help me locate them by contacting someone in security at the LAX airport to make sure the boys were ok. He told me no and had me go stand in the Allegiant line.  I waited patiently in line and finally up to the front to talk to the lady at the desk. I started to tell her what was going on and that I did not know where the boys were and she did not say a word - and put up a sign that said the line was closed. I finally got to talk to the man who handed me a piece of paper with a 800 number on it and told me to call and talk to them.  I called the number and it told me I had a minimum 45 min wait to speak to a representative. I did pick up the boys luggage that was checked in and sent (without them) so now I have the luggage and my boys do not get to spend the whole week as we had planned. Allegiant told them to come back on Friday and they will let them on the next plane out of there. Yes 4 days later. I am still shocked that nobody would help me out during the crazy ordeal and would not help me find a flight to get them here to us.",-1
2017-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Austin,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"poor communication, inconsiderate",False," Worse airplane experience ever with Allegiant Air. Poor communication, inconsiderate, delayed for hours. Boarded flight from Las Vegas to Austin at 3:35 were supposed to depart at 4:04. Sat on plane baking in the heat until 4:40. Staff stated we had to burn off fuel because of weight issues and would have to deplane. Deplaned for a hour and a half. At this time we were told there was an incident that caused the runway to be shut down. Got back on the plane to find out more people and more bags had been added so the plane had to be recalibrated. Didn't depart until 7:35. Made it back to Austin at 12:09 am. Took 30 mins for bags to come off the plane. 20 mins ride back to terminal. Waited on shuttle to take us to car which waa another 15 mins. So horrible.",-1
2017-07-10,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Stockton to San Diego,3.0,,4.0,,,4.0,4,Our experience with was great,False,"  We decided to use Allegiant Air to travel from Stockton to San Diego direct flight and value good. Once Allegiant opened we check in, luggage. Customer service representative at Allegiant was able to scan our boarding tickets from my phone. I would recommend you down load Allegiant app on your phone and pre-check in night before this process will be easy process. My friend recommended this and made it easier for us. Before we boarded our flight I informed the staff that scanned boarding tickets, my travel partner needed assistance with wheelchair. It would be difficult for her to walk the ramp to board plane. She took care of the arrangements and my travel partner was boarded with assistance and great customer service. Our departing and returning flights on time. She advised us to ask for assistance once we arrived at San Diego Airport and returning to Stockton Airport too. Our experience with Allegiant Airlines was great! Thank you!",1
2017-07-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Austin,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,fly with a better airline ,False,"  Las Vegas to Austin. This was my first time flying with Allegiant and also my last. Flight was scheduled to leave at 3:35 pm but was moved to 7:05 due to high temperatures in Las Vegas. I understand this was for safety reasons, but since the company is based in Las Vegas, why would you schedule a flight in the heat of the day during the month when the highest temperatures occur? When we finally boarded the plane at 8:10pm, we had to get off due to engine problems. Like other reviews we were told we will give updates every 30 minutes, we are getting you another flight, etc. At 11:30 pm we were finally told the truth, our flight was canceled. I don't even want to go into the horrible details of customer service and how most of the passengers had to sleep in the airport, myself included, because it was that bad. I will pay more to fly with a better airline that takes care of issues like this and actually cares about their customers. I truly don't believe the money you save is worth it.",-1
2017-07-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,this will be my last time,False,"  Indianapolis to Ft Lauderdale. I have been flying Allegiant for 10 years and have been on about 100 of their flights. I have airways looked past the constant delays and maintenance issues with their aircraft's because the price was so low. However, this will be my last time flying with Allegiant. I was just charged $50 at the gate for a carry on bag. This is for the same little backpack that fits under the seat with plenty of room that I have taken on every single flight with them. I have never been charged for it. If an airline is going to have different policies at different airports they need to notify customers of that. The people sitting next to me have larger bags by their feet and were not charged.  I've witnessed Allegiant employees being rude before and the unprofessionalism of some of the flight attendants is unbelievable. But the way I was just treated in Indianapolis is unacceptable. I'm actually relieved that I now have a reason to never give this company another $1 of my money.",-1
2017-07-05,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Walton Beach to Cleveland,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,I would fly Allegiant again,False,"  Fort Walton Beach to Cleveland return, which apparently is only a seasonal route. The airline offers a no-frills service. When you buy your ticket you get a seat at a very reasonable fee. If you need more space you have the option to buy more at that time for a fee. If you decide later to bring more luggage, that decision will cost you a few dollars more. When you purchase your ticket, the airline will assign a seat at check in. If you need to have a specific seat, you can purchase that seat for a fee. The airline boards in about 6 or 7 zones, based on seat assignments. If you are the kind of person who likes to get on early, you can pay for that as well. Lastly, tickets are non refundable, and allow for no changes.  So, if you think there is a pretty chance you will need to change you ticket, you had better buy the option to change it for a small fee. The planes I flew were A320s, which seat about 177, no seat back pockets and seats are fixed in place and do not recline. You get no free snacks or beverages, you can use major credit card to purchase snacks and beverages. So that is Allegiant Air in a nutshell. If you can deal with that, it is a great value. My flights were on time, actually one arrived early, and the staff was polite and professional. The airline starts boarding about 45 minutes before scheduled departure, so arrive early; because they do close the door 15 minutes before departure and you ain't getting on. I would fly Allegiant again, and recommend them.",1
2017-07-04,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to El Paso,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,it was far better than we expected,False,"  We paid $89 to fly with Allegiant Air from Las Vegas to El Paso TX. Our expectations were ""you get what you paid for"" but actually it was far better than we expected. Our flight was supposed to be departing at 7am, it was 7.40am when we departed but it wasn't the airlines fault and they kept us informed about the situation. We arrived at the airport at 6.15am, the employees were friendly and when we told them our flight was at 7am they sent us to the front of the line. When checking the bags they were supposed to weigh 40 lbs and we ended up with 42 lbs, they didnt charge us any extra fee. It was a really good experience and we will fly with them again.",1
2017-07-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline ever,False,"  Worst airline ever. I booked my confirmed ticket to Vegas with my mom and my boyfriend from 27th to 29th June return. And the airline cancelled the the return flight and we all 3 got stuck. And they didn't even have the courtesy to call us or anything. They just sent an email that your flight has been cancelled sorry. We had work the next day and we got to know about our flight cancellations a night before our flight. We all had to call in sick at our work and lost so much money. On top of that they had no other flight that day and not even the next day from Vegas. I mean they had no flight until 2nd of July (no flight for next 4 days). We felt like we are stuck here forever. We made a huge mistake by booking this airline. They gave us $150 compensation when we book flight from them next time. I mean this is not what we want. And I called their customer service the lady was so rude on the phone, I asked her to book another flight for us as it's not our fault that your airline doesn't have flight for next 4 days. She said sorry I can't do anything, you have to book it yourself. And the flight from same day was so expensive that we couldn't afford it (it's was more than 1500 dollars for 3 of us). We were so stressed out and our trip turned into a worst nightmare because of this airline. Then I called this airline customer service again and asked her which one is the closest city where we can take flight for next day. Then she told me there's one flight from Mesa, Arizona next day in the evening. So we told her to book that as we had no other option. We paid for hotels for one more day which cost us $450 dollars because we booked it on spot same day and then we booked a car which was $580 dollars plus fuel that costed us $100 dollars. My boyfriend drove us from Vegas to Mesa-Phoenix airport which was 5 hour drive. It was so stressful and depressing experience for us. We had to go through a lot on this trip. Even we reached Bellingham at 9pm, it took us another 3 hours to reach home as there was huge lineup at the border. Please be aware before you book flight from this airline. We had the worst and stressful experience. We will never book from this airline again.",-1
2017-06-29,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin Bergstrom to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,5,lack the most minimum comforts,False," I was very disappointed at Allegiant and Austin-Bergstrom Airport after taking flight 1337 from Austin to Cincinnati Sunday night. There was no mention by Allegiant, warning passengers that the airline was now flying out of the 'South Terminal'. The terminal was a long drive from the main terminal, and anyone not arriving in plenty of time could have easily missed the shuttle from the main terminal to the 'south 40' where Allegiant now departs and arrives. This terminal is primitive at best. There are no jetways; you walk out on the tarmac to the aircraft, then climb a long set of incline ramps to get into the plane. Not fun in Texas 90-100 degree heat; I can only imagine what that would be like in a rainstorm! Any passenger flying Allegiant out of Austin should be warned in advance via your website, email or text message that the airline is now using a remote terminal with very limited facilities. I have taken three flights on Allegiant. On all three flights, the seats do not recline. They barely have padding. Allegiant should warn their potential passengers that their aircraft lack even the most minimum comforts. There is no free beverage service; not even a glass of water. There is no WiFi, or any type of entertainment. Bring a pillow and blanket if you need one, and be ready to sit in the same position for the duration of your flight. The only thing this airline has going for it is price.",-1
2017-06-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chattanooga to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,will never fly with Allegiant ever again,False,"  Another Friday night ruined by Allegiant Air. At 7am I got a text saying my flight from Chattanooga to Tampa was delayed from 4.45 until 5.54. I arrived at the airport at 5, only to get a text from Allegiant saying it was delayed until 8.30pm. Nevermind the plans I had at my destination, this happens every time. I will never fly with Allegiant ever again.",-1
2017-06-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Reno,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,staff are very unprofessional,False," I advise anyone who is thinking about traveling with Allegiant to spend the extra $40 to get on a flight with a competing airline. Our flight from Vegas to Reno was delayed 5 hours eith no estimated time of arrival, there are no gate agents to be found at the podiums to ask questions, communication with the passengers is poor. After being delayed and boarding the plane we had to wait another hour sitting on the plane while they looked at a maintenance issue unfortunately we had to get off and the flight was canceled, the airline offered a hotel for the night but did not provide transportation to the hotel. The voucher was an $8 meal ticket that could only be used at the airport but unfortunately it was 10pm at night and all of the restaurants in the airport had closed. Although it's not the staff's fault the flight was delayed they handled the situation poorly. Gate agents are nowhere to be found and do not inform customers on the situation. Please please do not travel with Allegiant, the crew and staff are very unprofessional and the planes are always have maintenance issues.",-1
2017-06-28,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fresno to Las Vegas,3.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,1.0,1,it was very slow getting moving,False,"  Flew from Fresno to Las Vegas and we were delayed over two hours due to a computer reset, they said (but not until we boarded was this explained) and then had to get someone to sign off on it and go through all the check points. Some people had to rebook flights as they were connecting out of Vegas and were missing those connections. Well, we figured this could happen to any airline. However, on the way back the exact same thing happened! That was preceded by an announced gate change from Gate B-6 to Gate A-16, except there is no gate A-16 and we were left to scramble with other passengers trying to figure out where in the heck we were supposed to be, although our electronic boarding passes did eventually get properly updated. That was the third gate change they announced for different flights in the three hours we waited. I've never experienced that with any other airline. When it was time to board, the loud speaker did not work so those of us who paid for priority boarding heard nothing unless you were standing next to the guy speaking. And boarding was a full hour before the flight was supposed to be able to take off. Without word-of-mouth few priority boarders would have made it. But there was no rush because we were delayed once again due to ""computer malfunction"" and another reinspection checklist. We sat on the tarmac for an hour and 40 minutes. Once the plane started it was very slow getting moving, we lost the A/C - 110 in Vegas! - and the exhaust smell was overwhelming because they left the doors open too long. The upshot was the crew was very pleasant to us but they looked harried and exhausted themselves. I'm sure they must be sick of this as I now know delays are normal with Allegiant. The low price that drew us in was anything but after all the added fees. Our $100 tickets each were $260 each when all was said and done. We won't be flying Allegiant again. There is much that needs to be fixed at Allegiant.",-1
2017-06-26,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lexington to Myrtle Beach,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,will not use them again,False," I was apprehensive to begin with to fly Allegiant from Lexington to Myrtle Beach because of all the mixed reviews, but my family and I took a chance. While in line to check our bags, I received a text saying the flight would be delayed until 3:35 (was scheduled to leave at 1:09). I was not surprised, as I had been warned that that were notorious for delays. However, after getting through the gate, we received text after text delaying the flight for another hour and a half. There were problems with the engine from a return flight - supposedly from a bird getting sucked into it. Long story short, we finally boarded our plane around 6pm. As we got on the plane, the lights were flickering and it smelled strongly of gas. They seated us all and within about 15 minutes, had everyone get back off the plane due to auxiliary power issues. When we got back inside, we had to wait another couple of hours for maintenance to arrive, and thank goodness the problem was fixed and we finally made it to Myrtle Beach after being at the airport all day, 7 hours after scheduled flight time. I will say though, once we were in the air, there were no problems. The return flight was on schedule with no problems. I will not fly Allegiant again. We missed the first day of our beach vacation sitting at the airport all day. We did each get a $50 voucher to Allegiant for all the troubles, but no thanks. Will not use them again.",-1
2017-06-24,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Columbus,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,terrible airline,False," As we were about to depart Punta Gorda to Columbus with all passengers in their seats for 45 min, we're told there's a ""maintenance issue"" that has been addressed but needs signed off on to ""keep the FAA happy"". Being told the same message 3 times, we're finally told to leave the plane because the issue was worse than expected. The pilot said that they'd do something to get us home today, and after another 30 min wait we're told that there will be a ""special plane"" sent to get us first thing in the morning. No offers for any alternative. Everyone was angry, as expected, and when asked when asked what accommodations will be, their customer service shrugged their shoulders and said we could ""go find a hotel or wait it out"". No offer for hotel vouchers, meal vouchers, or rental cars. I found a flight 3 hours later out of an airport 40 miles away on a competing airline and was laughed at when asking them to get me a ticket. I am going to have a serious issue now not being able to get to my office tomorrow. I've just been updated that the 6am ""special flight"" is now pushed to 1:15. Their best offer was $100 on their terrible airline for my next trip with them. I declined.",-1
2017-06-24,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oklahoma to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,1,"Delay, delay, delay",False,"  Oklahoma to Las Vegas. Delay, delay, delay and lost a full say of our 3 day trip to Vegas! Stayed in airport overnight with a full flight of other travelers! Lost money & vacation time then felt terrible the 1st day to do anything at all from being at airport all night! Had to pay for a Vegas hotel that we didn't even get to sleep in! They have more excuses, same thing on return flight! Get your act together Allegiant. The Allegiant plane next to us, had to board, reboard 3x, broken down planes, over heated planes, had to sit in final plane 4 hrs waiting for all crew/pilot to get there from other places because Pilot timed out his hours.",-1
2017-06-22,1.0,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,VPS to EWR,5.0,2.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,one of the better flights,False,"  Allegiant was one of the better flights I have taken in the last year. While everything is a-la-carte right down to a carry-on bag, to a bottle of water, the price was amazing, the flight attendants were professional, the airplane was new and clean and our flight departed and landed on time. We will fly Allegiant whenever possible as long as the rates and quality service continue to be amazing. My advice - take advantage of paying for the checked baggage or carry when booking or when they email you a flight reminder. Do you know you get one carry-on free as long as it can be placed under the seat in front of you. If you have to store it in the over-head bin then you have to pay. Also, drinks are $2 each, credit card only, no cash. However, I paid $3.90 for a bottle of diet soda in the airport when I could have bought one for $2 in flight. Knowing your options up front is the key to a successful trip with Allegiant.",1
2017-06-21,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Baltimore,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,2,Dreadful service,False,"  Flew Allegiant Air Asheville to Baltimore. Dreadful service. They cancelled the flight after all of us had arrived at the airport, and then kept people waiting for a long time to get a hotel voucher. Their explanation for flight cancellation? ""Maintenance"". The flight left the next day without incident and more or less on time. I've traveled Allegiant before and never had such a dreadful experience.",-1
2017-06-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,it's not worth it,False," Please don't think it is worth flying Allegiant even if you got your ticket for dirt cheap like I did. It's not worth it. Flights will be cancelled - not just delayed but cancelled. But they won't be cancelled within a timely manner. You'll arrive to the gate before you get word of anything. First, they'll keep you hanging on to false hope that maybe your flight is only delayed, as they notify you in 30 minute increments to wait 30 more minutes several times over. After several hours of waiting only then will you be told that no, in fact, the flight is cancelled. As in - go home, find somewhere to stay tonight, and come back in a day or two to try again and that isn't even a guarantee. Actually, count yourself lucky if your flight is only delayed by 5 or 6 hours. Getting to your correct destination and on time is equivalent to winning the lottery.",-1
2017-06-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fresno to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have experienced,False," Allegiant is the worst airline I have experienced. We travelled from Las Vegas to Fresno, and that was declared delayed by 3 hours and when we got on the flight, the flight attendants were joking over the intercom and not really giving a damn about the passengers. Never knew how long the flight was because they kept saying the wrong thing and then laughing on the intercom. Doesn't go down well. Then we go on our returning trip; they turn up 20 minutes late at the check-in desk. Signs for check in are the wrong place so people were getting confused. Get to the gate and minutes before boarding they announce the flight is 2 hours late. That is after 20 minutes of people getting confused because the sign at the gate changed to Denver. I honestly hope people read this post, refuse to use their service and not use them.",-1

The worst airline experience I've had, driving would have been a better option! 3 hours delayed on the way out and now 2.5 hours (and counting) delayed on the way back, with very little notice given on the delay. Regarding the flight itself, the staff made mistakes over the tannoy and openly laughed about it.",-1
2017-06-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Destin,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"absolutely horrible"" ",False," Absolutely horrible from Oklahoma City to Destin - we will never fly Allegiant again! On our way to Panama City, they delayed the flight two hours. We are driving from Tulsa at this point so we continue on. We get there, wait hours until the flight and they cancel it 45 minutes before. We then have to go find all our luggage (we have 3 families, 12 of us). And decide to rent a car to just drive to Panama City. Then we barely hear over the intercom after an hour of figuring out rental cars the flight gets put back on. We arrive in Florida around 11:30pm. On our way home we arrive on time, then We're stuck on runway because there is another Allegiant plane loading passages on our gate. Babies screaming. The flight attendant keeps yelling over the Intercom to not let babies get passed off to relatives. Horrible. Never again and everything costs money - even water.",-1
2017-06-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ogdensburg to Sanford,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly this airline again,False,"  I will state never fly this airline again after the horrific experience we had this week. We booked a trip with Allegiant to fly from Ogdensburg NY (near our home town of Ottawa, Ontario) to Orlando but it's actually Sanford which is about 45 minutes from the Orlando International Airport and north of the city. Our departure flight was late due to heavy air traffic in the Orlando area; delay of 90 minutes. There is no car rental agency at all in Ogdensburg, so if you happen to get stuck there, you're out of luck! On June 10, we arrived back at the Sanford Airport, having dropped off our rental, and entered Terminal B to check in for our return flight on June 11. It was a clear day. We were greeted by an airport person that advised up before even entering the check-in line that our flight had been cancelled, and we would need to go to Terminal A (?). Once we walked all the way over there, we were in a line with all the other passengers from the flight. Two employees were at the counter. It took us over an hour to reach the front only to be told the flight was not rescheduled and we could fly home on Wednesday! No offers of anything other than a voucher to fly again with Allegiant for the missed flight; not the total. All this resulted in us having to book another car; drive to Orlando; book a JetBlue flight at $1000 to Syracuse; rent another car in Syracuse; drive to Ogdensburg to pick up our car, then back to Watertown to drop off the 3rd rental of that day and drive home; arriving in Ottawa at 6:00 a.m. the following day! With flights and cars, the added cost was $1500! So much for a $69 airfare to Sanford! I could have flown business class from Ottawa on a major airline for less than it ended up costing us to fly Allegiant. I have tried several times to call the number listed on a slip of paper the airport employee handed us after our hour-long wait. I would caution anyone this is even remotely thinking of traveling with this airline to think twice. a major airline, you would be flying into and out of major airports where other airlines would be available, and partner airlines possibly available to help you get home. With Allegiant, they fly into 'fringe' airports that only cater to just them or them and a few other charter airlines (as in Sanford). They cancelled their flight with absolutely no explanation to passengers, and no rescheduling. Speaking with other passengers, this is a frequent occurrence with this airline.",-1
2017-06-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Myrtle Beach,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,do not waste your money,False," Do not fly with Allegiant Air. Our original flight from Cincinnati to Myrtle Beach was delayed almost 4 hrs and now our return flight home is delayed. We have a 1 and 3 year old with us which makes this experience even worse. The customer service is the absolutely poor. Lady at the desk says that the reason for the flight delay this time is due to bad weather in Cincinnati, which is strange because my husband is in Cincinnati and says the weather is 83 and sunny. One of the airport workers told me to never fly Allegiant because they have flight delays every day because they don't have enough planes to accommodate the flights they schedule. I don't think I would be as annoyed if I hadn't had issues with Allegiant in the past. Do not waste your money.",-1
2017-06-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Moline,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"frustrating, and exhausting",False,"  Orlando to Moline. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early. My wife and I have 5 kids and pre checked in the night before. We had a stroller and a car seat so we could not use the express kiosk. We had to wait in line for 2 hours just to check our bags. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 7:15. My wife, my five kids and I rush through security and got to our gate in time before the flight left. We are just now taking off and it is 8:23. Very poor process and experience thus far. I would recommend if it is fiscally an option to spend extra money to use a different company. This has been a horrible, frustrating, and exhausting experience. Mistakes happen, I get it. Hopefully someone from the company reads this and treats this as a learning experience and look to grow from it.",-1
2017-06-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Rosa to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst airline I had to deal with,False,"  Worst airline I had to deal with. We (my wife and I) planned a 7-day trip to Grand Canyon. The flight from Santa Rosa, CA to Las Vegas (flight 569 from Santa Rosa to Las Vegas) seemed to be very convenient. No need to drive to San Francisco, inexpensive. We arranged everything: we booked a round trip flight with Allegiant, a car rental From Las Vegas airport, a week stay at the hotel in Flagstaff, some prepaid excursions. So we were waiting for boarding at the airport, hearing that the boarding starts in a few minutes again and again. Then we got a message that the flight was delayed for an hour. About an hour later, it was announced that the flight was canceled (without rebooking) for technical reason. We were not offered any option to have our flight rebooked with Allegiant or any other airline even we were ready to fly from any another other (San Francisco or Oakland) Bay Area airport. We have so many things scheduled (and paid for) already. We were told: ""go to SFO or OAK and try to book another flight by yourself"". We only got two $150 vouchers that we could use with Allegiant Air. Those vouchers are worthless since we are not going to fly with this airline. Never again! Money paid for the reservation for the roundtrip with the airline is supposed to be refunded (including car rental). At least Allegiant Air customer service representative told us so. It is still too early to confirm if we get all the money we paid during our booking with Allegiant. It may take a few day to confirm if we got our money back. But what about all other expenses? A week worth of taken vacation time, the hotel reservation that was too late to cancel, pre-booked excursions. I am not even talking about small things like driving to airport, paying for parking. Any normal airline would at least pay cash for ""inconvenience"" and would rebook a flight with another airline, pay for the hotel. As I said earlier we would be OK with driving to San Francisco or Oakland and fly from there. No company have the right to treat its customers like this. The company is supposed to be responsible for their poor service and for the ""lost"" customer’s time and money.",-1
2017-06-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Kansas City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,horrible customer service,False," I didn't think an airline could be worse than Spirit. Then I flew Allegiant from Las Vegas to Kansas City. I paid $10 for boarding passes to be printed at the airport, then was told by Allegiant staff at the airport that I would need to download the app anyway because they would not print them. I had also booked two tickets, but the seats were placed in different rows, even though the rows we were seated in were not full. The airline refused to change the tickets to accommodate. For most airlines that is an automatic. Then, when boarding, flight staff tried to force us to put our carryons under the seat, saying only pre-paid carryons were allowed in the overhead. I had pre-paid for my carryons but they told me without even asking. Overall, horrible customer service. I am writing this before takeoff. Who knows what additional issues will happen in flight.",-1
2017-06-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Knoxville,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly this airline again,False,"  Ft Lauderdale to Knoxville. I will never fly this airline again. I was supposed to fly into Knoxville from Ft lauderdale a week ago but the flight was cancelled after wasting the whole day in the airport. We boarded the plane and was then informed by the captain that there were ""air conditioning"" problems with the plane, however I don't buy it. They then had us deplane and cancelled it. It would have been nice if allegiant could have brought in another plane to get people to their destination because of mechanical problems but of course they did not and left us all stranded. Allegiant air made up for the cancelled flight and put me on the same flight today but to no surprise the flight was delayed almost 3 hours. Seats are not comfortable at all (there is what seems like a metal bar in the seat where your mid back lies), plane is hot, offered nothing but water. The only good thing about this airline is the price but I am more than willing next time to spend a little extra instead of dealing with this nonsense airline again.",-1
2017-06-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Des Moines,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1,never fly Allegiant again,False,"  Las Vegas to Des Moines.  Cancellation was notified 5 minutes before shuttle arrived to take us to airport, and was advised next flight out was Sunday, which was 4 days later, they didn't care if one was stranded! Our only option was to drive 24hrs back to Iowa. Will never fly Allegiant again, and advise that unless you have another way back from your destination you shouldn't either.",-1
2017-06-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to McGhee Tyson,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,terrible overall experience,False,"  Newark to McGhee Tyson. Unfortunately, extremely terrible overall experience. The booking itself was weird, went through many companies, everyone taking their share, Allegiant cancelled my flight 3 hours before and no one there to provide direction. I have a quadriplegic son at home and it was necessary for me to get back home ASAP, but no one to give any direction. The answer from Allegiant rep at airport was ""you can drive 2 hours to the next airport, but I do not know whether you can get a flight from there. What a help! More than that, worst customer service you can even imagine. Regarding the cancelled flight, yesterday, I was on the customer line waiting for response for more than 2 hours, and no answer. Right now, I am again on the line, but still waiting. I will not recommend this airline to any one.",-1
2017-06-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pasco to Las Vegas,2.0,3.0,5.0,,,5.0,3,very frustrating,False," Originally flew Allegiant Air from Pasco to Las Vegas June 2, 2017. Flight was delayed an hour, wasn't notified. Catching my flight back to Pasco June 5, 2017 and arrived in time and right as the boarding time came along, received a text. Saying that the flight was delayed another hour. It is very frustrating to have cab's set up and rides set up and have to rearrange everything last minute do to Allegiant's planes needing ""mechanical work""",1
2017-06-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Orlando Sanford,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,cancelling and notified no one,False,"  Pittsburgh to Orlando Sanford. I must stress the poor quality of staff, equipment and dependability of Allegiant Air. we reluctantly tried this airline because of the seemingly low fares. Our initial flight from Pittsburgh, PA on 5/25/17 was delayed 4 hours with no appearant reason, at the airport several passengers that flew this airline before stated they will delay a flight that is not full to double up passengers on the next later flight that day. Seats and inside of the plane were beyond bad and were like sitting on boards at best. Staff was less than friendly at best. Getting past this less than pleasurable part of our trip we ventured to Orlando Sanford Airport from our Daytona home on 6/4/17 for an early first flight of the morning 7:30 am to return home. A few moments after boarding was to have already began I received an E Mail from the airline with two 100.00 vouchers while wondering why they were sent we notice a while later the flight crew leaving the gate area, we assumed a gate change but to our surprise they cancelled the flight without explanation and seemed to care less about any passengers travels or inconveniences. We were told to head to another terminal for food and hotel vouchers that were another horrible excuse for customer service. We knew now what the vouchers were for, they new ahead of time the flight was cancelling and notified no one, the flight was rebooked for for 6/5/17 at 7pm. The food voucher for 2 entire days was 8.00 per per person.",-1
2017-05-31,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Orlando Sanford,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,rather pay a little bit more,False,"  Flew Allegiant Air from Cleveland to Orlando Sanford. No greeting by any of the staff on the plane when boarding and landing. The only communication was asking to purchase a beverage and a 10 minute sales pitch to the entire plane on applying for their credit card. The plane was not clean and the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The boarding process to and from our destination was long. Our return flight was just as unfriendly as coming down. The only difference was the speech for your credit card was half as long. Again, no greeting boarding or exiting the plane. I understand its a low cost flight but they charge for everything. The check in of $40 is crazy. We paid the $15 to carry a bag on and was limited to bag and my purse. Then you play for your seat, again I get it because that's how you keep costs down. But, to pay $10 for a boarding pass its a bit excessive. I printed from home and luckily the hotel allowed us or we would have been screwed to pay more. No coffee on the plane. We could pay at $2 though. The seats were like sitting on wood. I'm very disappointed and honestly would rather pay a little bit more and not deal with all of this. When its all said and done, your costs are not as low in comparison to other airlines.",-1
2017-05-27,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Baltimore Washington,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,4,she is very rude to us,False,"  I flew recently on Allegiant Air from Cincinnati to Baltimore Washington. I did online check in and everything ahead of time as I am traveling with 2 kids. I stopped at the ticket counter just to drop my checked baggage. My flight was at 7.30 am and I was at the counter at 6.20 am to drop my checked baggage The receptionist at Allegiant air at CVG airport said boarding closed for that flight at 6.15 am, so she can not take my checked baggage. I asked there is 75 mimutes to the flight, boarding supposed to be closed 45 minutes before, why 75 minutes early, she said I dont know.  Then the staff from the next counter came and said to her boarding for that flight is not closed until 6.45 am that means I still have 25 minutes. If the other receptionist won't come and correct her what should have happen. It's very annoying what she did to me when I am traveling with two kids, she is not helpful and she is very rude to us.",1
2017-05-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fresno,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly Allegiant again,False,  Las Vegas to Fresno. Got to the airport early due to hotel check out. Would not let me stand by for earlier flight even though seats are available. Would not let me check my bags and go sit in airport club to get work done. Making me sit in the ticketing area for 4 hours before being able to check in when no other airline does this. Their ticketing agents are rude. Their phone customer service is rude. And their overall customer service and policies are severely lacking in treating their customers right. Their customers pay their salaries. Their canned speeches at the end of a flight about having a choice of airlines to fly and they are glad you chose theirs and they hope to see you on a future flight is ridiculous. But they are right. I do have a choice of airlines to fly and I will spend more money or drive great distances to never fly Allegiant again.,-1
2017-05-24,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Knoxville,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,No complaints what-so-ever,False,"  Flew from Newark to Knoxville with my family of four. Tickets were $58/per person. Flights are very specific with regard to what days/times they fly to & from locations so you have to be flexible if you want a great deal! Our Thursday flight out of Newark was at 11:57am, because that's the only flight they have on Thursdays. We weren't able to fly home with Allegiant because they're flight between TYS & EWR on a Sunday is a 9am flight (like I said, very specific) and 9am on Sunday morning didn't leave us enough time to enjoy our last day away. So here's the scoop, the seats don't recline, food and drinks are for a fee (nothing is complimentary), and there's a fee to pick specific seats on the plane so your party can all sit together. That all being said, we left on time, the flight attendants were friendly and professional, the ride was smooth, and we arrived 5 mins early. The next time we travel, Allegiant will be the first airline I check with for travel deals. No complaints what-so-ever.",1
2017-05-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Colorado Springs,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not offered anything besides water,False,"  Allegiant Air are the worst airline I've flown with. They loaded us onto our already delayed (by one hour) flight from Las Vegas to Colorado Springs, just to have us sit there for over two hours, when they would come over the loud speaker to inform us of updates. All they would say is that it was due to ""paperwork"". For the first whole hour of waiting, there was no air conditioning provided (mind you we were in Las Vegas so it was hot). They finally gave us Air Conditioning and offered us ""complimentary cups of water"". Absolutely unnaceptable! Not only did we have to sit on the small plane for over two hours but we were not offered anything besides water the whole time or to compensate for our time waited. I am flying with my 3 year old daughter and she had to sit there for this whole time during dinner time, we weren't able to even get off the plane to get her food. The whole situation is completely ridiculous and I will never fly Allegiant again.",-1
2017-05-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Idaho Falls to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst flight of my life,False,"  This was perhaps the worst flight of my life. Trust me they are cheap in many ways. Operating from a very small airport in Idaho Falls, they delayed my flight by 1 hr 30 mins. I hadn't a connector from Las Vegas from the other terminal. The inflight attendants and people at gate were rude and did not pass the message that I wouldn't be late for the connector. When I contacted their customers care it took forever to connect and somebody went it's not their job to see whether the connector was made or not. Upon saying I would lodge a complaint the lady went ""we don't care about those"". I wonder with that attitude how are the things still in business. For the record, while I write this review I am waiting in the boarding area for the return flight to Idaho Falls - and it's late by 2 hrs. Till now I have experienced the usual ""we dont care"" attitude. I am trying to be as reserved as possible when I'm reviewing this. It's worse than that. I have had better experience with the worst bus services. Their app is the worst as well. I believe they don't be understand the concept of updates because you'll probably be stranded at the gates and receive the update after you reach your destination",-1

Flights departed on time and arrived early. Cabin crew was top-notch. Ultra-friendly and helpful. Boarding process was fast and efficient. In-flight announcements were crystal clear. Aircraft aren't new. You pay for every service, including in-flight refreshments. And you pay for carry-on bags. But, you're sometimes able to get a round-trip airfare fewer than four days before departure for the price of other airlines' cheapest fare.",1

We got a text an hour before our flight saying that it would be 45 minutes late. Now it is 3 hours later and two planes scheduled to land after us have left. No updates or reason why we are late. Unexceptional service is to say the least. The lady on the telecomm keeps forgetting to say which flight she is referring to so everyone is confused.,-1
2017-05-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Bozeman, MT to Las Vegas, NV",1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,a cancelled flight and setbacks for many,False,"  Our flight was cancelled and moved to next afternoon after a safety issue that the crew did not notice until a customer pointed out. He was joking about it, but eventually it led to a cancelled flight and setbacks for many. Allegiant believes that their offer of $100 voucher for next time is an appropriate way to handle the situation. I disagree. I like many other customers will end up eating the cost of a day lost that we were supposed to be in Las Vegas and Allegiant offers poor customer support and solutions that I would call satisfactory. While I understand that a safety issue is not a foreseen event, I do not believe Allegiant offered anything close to the value of the costs eaten beyond anything booked through Allegiant. It is frustrating that Allegiant believes that they offered great customer support when indeed they did not.",-1

I have been flying this route routinely for the last 3-4 years. I have experienced few delays, ground and in-flight staff been always polite and accommodating.

2017-05-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore-Washington to Asheville,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,flight was delayed multiple times,False,"  Baltimore-Washington to Asheville. The flight was delayed multiple times from 8:41pm-10:20pm, and once we finally boarded the filthy plane, we sat on the jet way for an hour, where we were then told that we we had ""dangerously low"" hydraulic fluid levels, and we would need to return to the gate. We did not receive another update for at least 15 minutes, and when we did, the pilot was not sure if we would be able to complete the flight-- maybe, probably, and stuttering occurred, all very reassuring. We took off at approximately 1:15 am to arrive to Asheville, NC around 3am. The flight attendants ran out of water on the plane (we were on it for 5 hours). Once we arrived the people that were force to gate check their luggage seemed to be the last ones standing - oh because they didn't see the luggage. Thank goodness for one employee who was very helpful and went back on the plane and got everyone's luggage. Allegiant did email everyone a $25 voucher for future flights, but I do not think anyone on that flight will ever fly allegiant again!",-1
2017-05-09,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1,rude and unprofessional,False,  Cincinnati to Fort Lauderdale. As I entered the aircraft and found my seat I was told by a flight attendant who was standing across from my seat to place my carry on bag under the seat. I had a carry on bag and a personal bag. I told her that carry on which I paid extra for is too big to go under the seat and should go in the compartment above. She said there is no room above my seat. I quickly scanned the upper compartments and saw right there lots of empty space in the compartment above other seats. I place my bag there and made my way to my seat. Than I heard the flight attendant making comments about me with another passenger. She didn't even try to hide it. It was rude and unprofessional and made me feel very uncomfortable.,-1
2017-05-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Casper to Las Vegas,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,awful airline to deal with,False,  Delayed 4 hours out of Casper to Las Vegas we didn't get into Vegas until 130. Now we are trying to return from Vegas to Casper and once again delayed because we have no crew. Totally unprofessional - they say they have low prices but nickel and dime for everything from luggage to picking your seat. Ridiculous. Would caution you or at least give a heads up that this is an awful airline to deal with.,-1
2017-05-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to Orlando,3.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,what we got was a disaster,False,"  Worst airline ever. We expected a quick flight down to Florida with Allegiant Air and back. What we got was a disaster. Our 9.00pm flight got cancelled after waiting until nearly midnight because of a mechanical problem. Flight the next day managed to be on time. On the flight back, we were already delayed about an hour from weather (not the airlines fault there), but about to take off and had to head back to gate because of yet another mechanical issue. Lovely. With all the negotiating of the airports and dealing with this horrible airline, we could have driven down and back for about the same time and paid way less than these ""discount"" tickets. If you're considering this airline because they're cheap, just don't. You get what you pay for. Subpar aircraft that appear to not be well maintained.",-1
2017-05-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Punta Gorda,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never once had a flight depart or arrive on time,False," In almost 10 years of choosing Allegiant Air, I have never once had a flight depart or arrive on time. my grandmother is 80 years old and we had to send her from Asheville to Punta Gorda by herself as we all live in FL. Her flight was delayed 3 hours. She did not get home until Midnight. This was not the first time I have been disgusted by Allegiants day to day operations but this the first time I wrote a review. Their airplane interiors are very cheap. The flights are cheap because every area of normal airline service is completely absent. Terrible airline unless you are broke and desperate. I would fly Delta 10 times over before I got on another Allegiant flight.",-1
2017-05-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Eugene,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the lack of customer service,False,"  Oakland to Eugene. I have never been more frustrated with the lack of customer service that I have experienced with Allegiant. I have sent multiple messages and tried calling multiple times, and have been unable to reach anyone. In March I had to fly from Oakland to Eugene due to my sister being in hospital. After arriving at the airport my flight was delayed. Then again. Then again. Eventually, after sitting in the airport for hours, it was canceled and I was told I would be receiving a small credit and the possibility (not guarantee) of a flight out the next day. The credit was not even enough for a full trip. Not only was my time wasted, but I then had to buy a last minute flight from SFO in order to make it to Oregon. It also meant that my ~$65 ride to the airport was for nothing. I had to pay for my new flight out. I had to pay to then get from the Oakland airport to the SF airport during rush hour. My family who had already driven two hours to pick me up at the Eugene airprot had to turn around and then drive 4hrs during rush hour to get to the Portland airport where I would now be flying into. And since I had now been at airports nearly all day I had to pay expensive prices for airport food. I have emailed and called numerous times and have never gotten in touch with anyone. I occasionally get emails back saying they will respond in 60 days. It has now been two months and my complaints haven't even been addressed. To top it off, I can't even access the credit I was promised.",-1
2017-05-06,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Springfield,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,staff was so gracious and patient,False,"  Mesa to Springfield. We had a situation that required a ticket modification. A staff member with Allegiant out of Las Vegas was so gracious and patient. She went above an beyond the call of duty to listen carefully to what we needed, to reassure us that she was there to help us and then to make the necessary changes to the ticket so we could extend a stay to attend to a family matter. We have flown extensively around the world over the last 20 years. Her care stands out as exceptional and ranks as one of the best customer services experiences we have ever had.",1
2017-05-02,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Great Falls,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,3,I feel we were mistreated,False,"  Yesterday while flying with my young daughter from Arizona to Great Falls we encountered a less than pleasant and accommodating flight attendant. My daughter, who is 9, were split up initially and my daughter became quite anxious and tearful about not being able to sit with me during the flight. However, after realizing there were multiple open seats I kindly asked if it would be possible to relocate so my daughter and I could sit together. The flight attendant appeared rude and annoyed when replying saying it was an inconvinience as she was counting passengers yet had just accommodated a fellow passenger who requested a window seat. After very reluctantly allowing my daughter and I to move one row up to be together she proceeded to tell us to ""hurry up or get back to your original seat"". She then tossed my sweater at me which I had left back in my original seat. This was a very disheartening and disappointing experience to say the least. I understand flight attendants have requirements to complete (ie: counting passengers prior to departure) however I feel we were mistreated. Customer service should be a priority. I will not be flying with Allegiant Air in the future.",-1
2017-04-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dayton to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,customer service not willing to help,False, Dayton to Tampa with Allegiant Air. Flight delayed for an hour and then canceled. Flight was rescheduled for 24 hours later! Had to book from a different city with terrible problems due to family flying also! Customer service not willing to help or even care!,-1
2017-04-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Punta Gorda,1.0,,4.0,,,3.0,1,never fly Allegiant again,False,"  Columbus to Punta Gorda. These were the worst flights I have experienced. The seats are so close together and are hard. We are seniors and my husband was in pain through both flights. The employees are great and flights were on time, but we would never fly Allegiant again.",-1
2017-04-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Stockton to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,2,unpleasantness of the flight,False,"  Stockton to Las Vegas. We flew out Friday April 7th and our flight was delayed 3 hours. I have never had an unexplained delay happen to me for this long. Onboard the plane as they are serving drinks they spilled on my friend's lap. The flight attendant said sorry, but didn't offer to grab her a napkin for it, until my friend spoke up about it. The flight attendant was rude in handling the spill and then proceeded to not take my friend's order. I had a ginger ale and the same flight attendant told me I had to finish it and stood there waiting for me with a scowl on her face. I understand finishing your drink before landing, but 2 more times another flight attendant walked by asking for trash after that, so there wasn't any urgency. She was by far the rudest flight attendant I have ever experienced. The price is not worth the delay or unpleasantness of the flight. I will be flying any other airline in the future.",-1
2017-04-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ogdensburg to Fort Lauderdale,,,,,,1.0,1,in the airport after three delays,False,"  Ogdensburg to Fort Lauderdale. Still in the airport after three delays. We were scheduled to leave at 9:50 am. They tell us our plane has mechanical problems and they are going to try to fix it. In the meantime another planes arrives that is scheduled to pick up people and go to Orlando. So they take our luggage off our broken plane and put it on this plane . But of course the people originally scheduled to go on this new plane to Orlando are bumped and are to have to wait for our original plane to be fixed. Just as we are to load on the plane they announce that it also is broken. We are all now sitting in the terminal double stacked looking at another 90 minute delay - they now tell us they are looking into getting two new planes. No food or drink in the terminal, not a great start to our four day holiday.",-1
2017-04-17,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Richmond,,,,,,1.0,1,never fly this airline again,False,"  Orlando to Richmond. They boarded us for our 8am flight. Then deboarded us for technical issues. Then delayed us until 11:40. Then told us the flight was cancelled and would be flying out the next day at 2:30. I had to work the next day and cannot miss work. So I had to book a flight with JetBlue for $600. All Allegiant Air did for my inconvenience was refund me and give me a $100 voucher. This screw up on their end cost me two Ubers ($40 each), my whole Easter spent in airports, and an extra $320 to get on the JetBlue flight. A total loss of $400 plus a whole day of Easter in airports and all they could do is give me a voucher for $100. I have never heard of a 32 hour delay. This is ridiculous! I will never fly this airline again. Spend the extra money and fly with a better airline. Their cheap fares are not worth the headache.",-1
2017-04-16,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago Rockford to Las Vegas,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,2,technique to get extra money from us,False,"  Chicago Rockford to Las Vegas. Not a bad flight for the price and the Rockford airport is much easier to navigate than O'Hare but frankly when I book the tickets together we should be sat together. I should not have to pay extra to sit next to my husband, especially when there were seats available. Shady technique to get extra money from us!",1
2017-04-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,don't inform you on anything,False,"  Knoxville to Fort Lauderdale. It was delayed due to a worker from the airport dropping jet fuel right outside of the plane. Nothing was wrong with our plane we just had to wait for it to be cleaned up. However, that took almost two hours with no air on a small confined aircraft with over 100 people. Not once did allegiant offer a drink or snack while we waited and the two men sitting next to me were in the wrong seats and the flight attendant acted like it didn't matter. The flight attendants were rude, and not once offered a drink or snack as we all sat there and sweated. Then, once we finally do get to our destination we have to sit there for another 45 min because they can't get the door open! Awful. I've flown with Allegiant multiple times but this flight was terrible. Very disappointed. I don't expect to have tv or free food on your flight, however I do expect to get a free snack if we are delayed that long and flight attendants don't inform you on anything. Neither did our pilot. We sat there for almost an entire hour before the pilot even informed us on what was going on.",-1
2017-04-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Wilkes-Barre to St. Petersburg,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,plane was dirty,False,"  Our first experience with Allegiant was June 2016. We had booked a weekend away to Clearwater for my husbands birthday weekend. The morning of our flight, we got a text that the flight had been cancelled. Took hours to get through to Allegiant. Received no explanation as to why it was cancelled and an alternate flight was not offered. They did refund our money but we lost a lot of money and time on previously booked excursions and meals. Not to mention my husbands birthday was ruined! They did also give us a voucher towards another flight, which we reluctantly used this past weekend. This past Friday March, 31, 2017, we were to fly out of Wilkes-Barre to St. Petersburg. Our flight was delayed by over 2 hours. Once finally on the plane we were stopped on the runway due to a mechanical issue with fear that we would not even be able to take off. Nearly 2 and a half hours past initial departure time we were finally cleared after they got the mechanical issue fixed. Now to think we are on a plane for the next 2 hours, a plane that just had an issue and couldn't take off. Once in flight, the pilot came over the speaker to tell everyone he apologized for the inconveniences and that the flight was almost cancelled as there was no pilot to fly the plane. Said he came in on his day off to fly it. The plane was dirty and had a terrible odor on it. Was afraid to touch anything. The bathroom was just disgusting. Smelt horrible and had mold near and around the sink and toilet. The only thing Allegiant had going for them was the staff. They were all friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this company to anyone! Not to mention once you add in all the fees for baggage and to pick a seat so you'r guaranteed to sit with your family, this company is not any cheaper than a real company like Delta or United! You don't even get a complimentary drink, you pay for a soda or water.",-1
2017-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Niagara Falls to Sanford,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,"rent a car and drive""
",False,"  Niagara Falls to Sanford with Allegiant Air. 8.30pm flight delayed for mechanical issues. Had us de-board the plane, wait for 3 hrs to then tell us we would be given vouchers for taxi and hotel and rescheduled our flight for 3.30pm the next day. The handling of the vouchers was a mess, there were 4 Allegiant staff members behind the counter - 1 of which was sitting down eating pizza. Instead of working efficiently by dividing up the stack of vouchers amongst them, they had 1 person call out names 1 by 1 of every individual on the plane while the other staff members just watched. In general, the staff lacked professionalism, compassion, and competency. To make matters worse, there was only 1 taxi that would accept the voucher. When I notified the Allegiant staff, I was told with a condescending tone that I could just walk to the hotel if I did not feel like waiting. At this time it was 1.30am and 34 degrees outside. The following day was not much improvement. The staff were sluggish and unconcerned. The bottom line, if your only option is to fly Allegiant Air, my advice is to rent a car and drive.",-1
2017-04-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mesa to Provo,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never do this again,False,"  Mesa to Provo. First and last attempt at flying this airline. They cancelled our flight 30 minutes after we were supposed to board. Was it for weather? No. Was it for mechanical problems? No. Was it because they didn't even have a flight crew? They had a plane, but apparently no one to fly it. So, a trip I've had planned for quite a while, took time off work and made multiple plans ... ruined. (My twelve-year-old son, not happy.). I am writing this review due to the complete lack of respect the frontline people showed the passengers in this crisis who just had their flight cancelled. They were very short and rude to the passengers in fothe not of me in line to the point that I simply got out of line and left. Allegiant Air has failed miserably to train their frontline people how to act in these situations. My money was ultimately returned, but only after about an hour of phone time and a dropped call (they hung up on me while on hold). I will never do this again.",-1
2017-04-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale,2.0,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,1,never fly this airline again,False,"  Indianapolis to Fort Lauderdale. Made the mistake of thinking Allegiant would be cheaper. After paying over $200 in baggage fees, and standing in a ridiculously long line at the ticket counter, with absolutely no staff in sight for over an hour, the worst customer service I have ever experienced, I wouldn't call it a bargain. I will never fly this airline again regardless of how cheap they appear at first.",-1
2017-03-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DSM to PGD,,,,,,,1,my flight has been canceled,False,"  I booked with Allegiant. I was to fly out at 5:30 pm. Planned to leave for the airport at 2:30 to be there at 3:30. At 11:30 I received an odd email giving me an Allegiant air voucher. Then 15 minutes later I get the email that my flight has been canceled. Being last minute I had to end up paying 4x the amount to book a flight with another airline. In addition I ended up getting to my destination over two hours later. I then tried calling customer service because I did not want a voucher and each time I called (a total of 3 or 4 times in the next 3 days) it said there was over a 30 minute wait time on the phone. On the last call I waited the time and spoke with a representative finally. She suggested I email the airline so I did. I then got an email back thanking me for my email and even though the subject line stated ""they will be in touch soon"" the email stated that it could take 60 days for a response. It has been ten days so far and no response yet.",-1
2017-03-28,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Gorda to Cincinnati,2.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,crew friendly and helpful,False," Punta Gorda to Cincinnati with Allegiant Air. Flights have always been on time, uneventful, and flight crews have always been friendly and helpful. Some may complain about the comfort and add-ons/upcharges, however, it is a discount airline, and with that, the fancier whistles and bells some higher prices carriers offer aren't going to be offered. No, the seats aren't the most comfortable, especially for plus sized individuals, but again, it's not meant to be first class accommodations when flying a discount carrier. Overall, I am pleased with my experiences with Allegiant, and will both recommend and fly them again in the future.",1
2017-03-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,an unorganized company,False," Fort Lauderdale to Indianapolis with Allegiant Air. What an unorganized company. Our gate was changed 3 times in 25 minutes. The flight time (both ways) was changed 3 times. How do you run a company with this kind of schedule changes? What about customers that had connecting flights? It's obvious that is not important. They charge for everything. The plane was dirty. The counter staff were cold and non-customer oriented. I could go on but since this will be my first and last experience with Allegiant, it is moot.",-1
2017-03-25,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Walton Beach to Las Vegas,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5,Perfect for short trips,False,"  Fort Walton Beach to Las Vegas. In hindsight I should've definitely taken the car rental discount Allegiant Air offered. I would recommend and will fly with allegiant again. Unless you need the extra legroom or just prefer a certain seat or need to sit together, I wouldn't pay to reserve a seat. Perfect for short trips!",1
2017-03-18,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Medford,4.0,3.0,5.0,,,4.0,5,offers amazing value,False," Los Angeles to Medford with Allegiant Air. I have flown this route every few months over the last 5 years. This airline offers amazing value. If you just buy the basic ticket (let them assign your seat, use mobile boarding pass, and pack light in a backpack), your price is always 50% less than the competing airlines. I think it is amazing. As far as airline performance, I would say 90% of my trips have been uneventful with no major delays or problems. I think that is pretty standard for air travel. I've experienced just as many delays or cancellations flying this route with Alaska or United.",1
2017-03-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Stockton,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,seats are very cramped,False,"  Las Vegas to Stockton. Ticketing is cheap, $5 for a boarding pass? $18 for a carry on, $18 for the 1st checked bag only if you pay online before the flight. Seats are very cramped. Window seat we got was next to the engine so you get a headache 5 minutes in. Selecting your seat is $8 extra. Soda is $2 and they won't let you bring a soda on board.  Never fly with them again.",-1
2017-03-14,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Tulsa,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,no consideration for their customers,False,"  Worst trip ever with this airline! Upon us arriving early for our flight we were informed that the flight was initially delayed for 3 hrs. We checked our bags and decided to leave the airport until two hrs before the delayed time. I received an alert on my phone saying my flight was rescheduled for the next day. No explanation, just a text. I later received a call from someone stating the flight was ""rescheduled"" and when could I come and get my luggage. I informed the customer service rep that I had to rely on someone else for transportation since I had already turned in my rental car. They stated ok. I received two more calls from the rep stating that I could come and get my luggage within 10 minutes or come at 8.30pm when someone returned to the ticket counter. I went back at 8.10pm awaiting the arrival of a customer service rep. No one ever came. I waited for over an hour only to finally get in contact with an employee who stated that I would have to get my luggage the next day because no one was returning to the airport that night! This airline has no consideration for their customers. Even though their prices are inexpensive you pay for it in customer service quality and care.",-1
2017-03-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,"Trenton, NJ to St. Petersburg Fl",1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,seats are very uncomfortable,False,"  First time flying Allegiant Air from Trenton, NJ to St. Petersburg Fl. The flight attendants are rude, the seats are very uncomfortable, the tray tables are half the normal size. Flight was delayed without any explanation. When I asked the flight attendant when does she expect us to land in St. Petersburg, her response was depends when we take off. I asked when does she expect us to take off, she said depends on how fast we board. But once we take off the flight time was 2 hours and 38 minutes. My only reason for asking was for me to coordinate my pickup ride at the airport and since they did not update the flight status on line or texting it was completely unknown. No consideration and complete lack of customer focus. Last time I checked being curtious did not cost anything extra. Also if you want water it will cost you 2 dollars.",-1
2017-03-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bellingham to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never thought to inform their paid customers,False,"  Without a doubt the worst experience of my life flying with Allegiant Air. I have travelled with all airlines from around the world both domestic and international. No airline has been 7 hours late, not updated their website even hours before the flight to advise their passengers. They admitted they knew the day before the flight from Bellingham to Las Vegas would be delayed but never thought to inform their paid customers. Even further they have a flight departing from the same airport to the same destination leaving on time 3 hours after our originally scheduled time and arriving on time yet our flight is to be told we will arrive 6.5 hours later than them. This is one of many consistent delays and problems this airline does to its customers. Spend the extra 100 dollars and fly with anyone except Allegiant Air.",-1
2017-03-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oakland to Mesa,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,just one of many unsatisfactory experiences,False,"  This is just one of many unsatisfactory experiences on Allegiant. We are on our return flight to Phoenix from Oakland, CA. Were first informed of a delay 2 hours prior to scheduled departure. The delay was increased 3 separate times until eventually a 7 hour delay. Instead of accommodating our flight with an earlier plane, (plenty of empty planes on the ground in Mesa,) Allegiant does what it does best - mess their customers around, making them wait so they can save a buck. A $50 voucher doesn't come close to compensating.",-1
2017-03-09,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to Fort Walton Beach,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,love the cheap prices of tickets,False,"  Knoxville to Fort Walton Beach. This was my first flight using Allegiant Air. The 2 concourse employees plus the two agents at the counter were shabbily dressed and those at the concourse were eating and drinking at their kiosk in plain sight of the customers. Once onboard we were very professionally greeted by the 4 flight attendents! The lead gave the usual intructions preflight but spoke in such a rapid manner it was very difficult to understand him. When beverage service began I put my tray down only to see it was filthy with crumbs and greasy fingerprints which I brought to the attendent's attention. She did immediatley return with a clean wipe and cleaned my tray. I noted that crumbs were all over the floor in front! All 4 attendents were very professional and neatly dressed. The pilot and copilot never came out of the cockpit to thank the passengers for flying Allegiant as very usual on all flights. I must congratulate the ground crew at VPS for their rapid unloading of our luggage for it was the fastest I have ever encountered! By the way, my flight number was 684VPS on 3/06 and my seat allocation was zone 3 seat 10E. We were informed was only 1/2 filled but we were not allowed to change our seats because of ""security"" reasons. I much prefer a window seat. I confirmed my reservation as requested 24 hours before departure online. The flight was supposed to take 1 hour and yet we arrived at our destination 20 minutes early! I love the cheap prices of tickets and easy to access online site.",1
2017-03-07,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to New Orleans,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,5,solid bang for your buck,False,"  Flew Allegiant Air from Raleigh to New Orleans. No frills airline, solid bang for your buck. Yes, you get nickel and dimed for literally everything (all the way down to printing boarding passes $5). No, the seats do not recline. No, there isn't wifi on board. No, you don't get a free drink for flying (drinks/snacks offered aren't outrageously priced). No, the gate staff aren't the best. Yes, flight attendants are just as good if not better than some I have flown with. Would definitely fly again. We were delayed on our initial flight out of RDU to MSY for Mardi Gras due to mechanical issues, but that happens to every airline. The direct flight that's offered now was significantly cheaper (over $400) than other airlines and honestly no complaints other than the nickel and diming and the initial delay. Would fly again.",1
2017-03-07,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Concord, NC to St. Petersburg, FL",3.0,3.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,I continue to be impressed,False,"  I had another great experience with Allegiant Air flying from Concord, NC to St. Petersburg, FL. This is probably my tenth time flying them and I continue to be impressed. Yes, they are an ultra-discount airline which means that you pay for any necessary add-ons. When you do your reservation on-line, you will see all the added fees before hand and not have any sticker shock at the airport. My round-trip from Concord, NC to St. Petersburg took place without a hitch. Both flights were on-time. The crews (except for one surly-faced flight attendant on the flight down to St. Petersburg) were all polite and professional. The planes were very clean and the gate crews at both ends did a good job of getting everyone on the plane in an orderly and timely manner. I would definitely fly with Allegiant again.",1
2017-03-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fayetteville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,they are just the worst,False,"  Las Vegas to Fayetteville. Absolutely the worst airline. I have flown Allegiant three times and each time I hoped my experience was a fluke, but unfortunately they are just the worst. I would like to say you just get what you pay for, but when you include foods and bags they cost the same as any other airline. This last flight they lost they place in line to depart because they took too long to board. We were delayed over 2 hours for a 2.5 hour flight and were not allowed to leave the plane to get water or food.",-1
2017-03-03,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Bozeman,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,Disappointment is the only word,False,"  Las Vegas, Nevada to Bozeman, Montana. Disappointment is the only word to describe this. My flight has switched to four different gates! In which two planes had mechanical problems after they had just landed. I'm sitting in the airport and have been waiting for three hours, they said ""we will board at 8:00 pm. If the plane is fixed"" - If! ""We don't really know what's going on"". I would not be worried if I knew that Allegiant would pay for a hotel if it never gets fixed, but everyone says they won't. So far I have seen my own two planes broken down today but also a third plane for the company.  The airline might be cheap but cheap quality comes with that.",-1
2017-03-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hagerstown to Clearwater,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,go with any other airline,False,  Hagerstown to St Pete Clearwater. Allegiant delayed the flight 3 hours before it was scheduled to depart then issued me a credit voucher instead of a refund and refused to pay for the hotel I had to stay in overnight in addition to the one I booked in Tampa for my vacation. Customer service takes at least 30 minutes of being on hold to get in touch with and when you do talk to them they're totally useless.  I'm rating one because a zero won't let me submit it. Save yourself the hassle and go with any other airline there is.,-1
2017-03-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rockford to Punta Gorda,,,,,,1.0,1,Think twice before booking,False,"  Rockford to Punta Gorda. 3 hours before leaving for the airport to head to FLA for a long planned winter vacation, I get a text from Allegiant, ""Your flight has been cancelled!"". No explanation and weather good at both departure and arrival airports. After looking at reviews and talking with others, there seems to be a common trend of this airline just cancelling flights. Think twice before booking with Allegiant.",-1
2017-03-01,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Las Vegas,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5,I always buy the extra perks,False,"  Cincinnati to Las Vegas. I love Allegiant Air, it is great value, with wonderful flight crew and direct flights. I've flown them at least 5 times with no issues. I think some people get put off by some reviews, but for a long weekend somewhere, Allegiant Air is usually always the best value in my opinion, and I always buy the extra perks.",1
2017-03-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Reno to Las Vegas,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst airline I have flown,False,  Reno to Las Vegas. By far the worst airline I have flown.  I arrived at the airport 1 hour and 30 minutes before my flight was scheduled to take off. When I arrived I asked women to check my back which would've been 30 dollars or so. She then proceeds to tell me they are about to close the gates and that I need to leave and run to my gate. So she refuses to check my bag. I arrive at the gate at about 12:30. 1 hour before my flight is schedule to take off and at the time they were to begin the initial boarding process. The lady at the desk rudely says so I assume your Crystal and the reason we haven't taken flight yet. They then proceed to tell me next time I better arrive early and charge me 50.00 to have one carry-on bag for a 45 minute flight. Do not recommend them at all.,-1
2017-02-28,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Stewart to St Pete Clearwater,3.0,,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3,I am very pleased with Allegiant,False,"  Stewart to St Pete Clearwater. I flew alone with my 3 kids (their first time on a flight, ages 6, 4 and 2). I didn't pay for seat locations so I had them assign our seats. They were great to place us next to each other however I couldn't do online check in. I had to wait at the ticket counter to check in and get charged $5 for each boarding pass to be printed. The plane is no frills but I came prepared with snacks and ipads and crafts for my kids to pass the time. On the return flight we were supposed to get a huge snow storm at home. Allegiant cancelled the flight around 12 pm when our flight was set to leave at 7 am. I received a text and email which was nice and a few minutes after that another one with the new flight info. I was nervous since Allegiant only flies Thursday and Sunday to my destination but they rescheduled it for the following day, Friday. Overall I am very pleased with Allegiant and look forward to flying with them again!",1
2017-02-27,0.2,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Raleigh,2.0,,3.0,,1.0,2.0,1,not use Allegiant Air again,False,"  My flights each way (from New Orleans to Raleigh) were delayed for maintenance issues. The numerous Fees charged exceeded cost of flight. Will not use Allegiant Air again even though it is a direct flight. I thought this would be a good alternative but without time or money saved, better off flying a trusted brand.",-1
2017-02-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ogden to Phoenix Mesa,,,,,,1.0,1,nothing positive to say,False,"  Ogden to Phoenix Mesa. I have nothing positive to say. This airline caused me to miss my grandmother's funeral due to lack of appropriate planning and communication on their part. After a whole day spent at the airport, being told the plane would be leaving at 1, then 3, then 4.30, then 6. What was originally supposed to be a 10:25 am departure, ended up in a wasted day, tears, and heartache. In the end, I ended up not going at all because I had already missed the funeral that started at 5pm. They refunded my money and gave me a $50 voucher for another time. To me, this does not even begin to make up for the heartache and stress they caused me and my family today. I am so severely disappointed in how this airline handled the issue. They didn't update the flight info, they waited for hours to update anyone and they were only offering flight vouchers but no refunds. They only refunded me due to the severity of my situation.",-1
2017-02-22,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Las Vegas,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,4,definitely give them another shot,False,"  Memphis to Las Vegas. I had a very mixed experience with Allegiant. First, our flight was delayed, but they emailed and texted us almost 2 hours before to let us know that would be the case. It happens, we appreciated the heads up. We were a little disappointed by the absolute now frills and nickel and diming that the airline does, but that's what you get with a low cost airline. Our big hiccup came when we landed in Las Vegas and found out that our bags had not been loaded on the plane. That meant that my wife and I, and our 3 year old and 1 year old had nothing (Due to charging for carry-on's we chose just to check everything). We were on vacation for 10 days and it took them 7 days to get our bags and car seats to us. But before I condemn anyone, Allegiant did right by us. They told us to go out and buy what we needed and they would reimburse us. Obviously we were skeptical, especially as the days went on without us getting our bags or car seats. But when all was said and done, they did reimburse us and we got a weeks worth of clothes out of it. It wasn't an amazing experience, but they did what they could to make it right. I'd definitely give them another shot.",1
2017-02-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Indianapolis,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,would not recommend this airline,False,"  Las Vegas to Indianapolis. This was my first experience with Allegiant Airlines. Like many others, I was enticed by the so called ""low airfares"". Soon thereafter I realized that it was all a facade. I had already paid $25 to check a bag and was told I had to pay an extra $50 because my luggage was 5 pounds over the weight limit. So in essence I paid $75 to check one bag. This is absolutely ridiculous! The lady at the ticket counter showed no sympathy whatsoever as she responded in her robotic, uncaring voice. When I got on the plane I realized you have to pay for any snacks-$3 for a small box of M&M's! At one point in the trip, the flight attendant whacked my knee cap quite hard with his service cart, hard enough to make me scream out. He asked if I was all right but continued rolling the cart down the aisle, not even waiting to hear my response. Nor did he even come back and apologize or ask if I was doing OK. And the button to recline my seat was absent, so I remained upright the whole three hours of flight time. I would not recommend this airline to any of my family or friends.",-1
2017-02-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Concord to New Orleans,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,2,poor customer service,False,"  Concord to New Orleans return. If you are use to flying with a reliable airline this company is not for you. Sure. The flights are cheap. If you are okay with poor customer service, uncomfortable seats, and cancellations that leave you stranded, this airline is for you. After four days in New Orleans our return flight was cancelled. We were told the flight would be rescheduled for the following day but they couldn't confirm when that would flight would depart. After speaking with a customer service representative who stated "" I don't know what you want us to do"" when I asked about a hotel compensation. I was thoroughly disappointed. Needless to say $316 later (out of pocket) a rental car and ten hours later. My friends and I are almost back home. Oh, and half of us have to return to work in a few hours.",-1
2017-02-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Oakland,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,had horrible service,False,"  Las Vegas to Oakland. This airline was delayed on both routes, and had horrible service. The flight out was delayed 2 hours prior to boarding, then another hour once boarded due to issues ""getting the plane started"". The flight back was delayed due to another delayed flight ""taking our plane"". We had to wait for another flight to land and send us back to our destination. Despite what appears to be a cheap ticket, it's not worth the ridiculous fees or the travel disruption.",-1
2017-02-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Concord,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,filled plane with too much fuel,False,  Orlando to Concord. Awful experience. Gross negligence and incompetence. Flight was delayed and rerouted to an alternate city because Allegiant filled the plane with too much fuel. Spent an hour sitting in the plane without moving. Terrible communication and rude flight attendants. There was no reimbursement nor restitution for the 2+ hour inconvenience. Recommend never flying Allegiant.,-1
2017-02-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Allentown to Orlando Sanford,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,what an unpleasant experience,False," Allentown to Orlando Sanford. This is my first time flying Allegiant Air. All I can say is what an unpleasant experience. First off they nickel and dime you for everything. Seats, bags, etc. I booked a hotel through them when I purchased my tickets. I then find out the hotel is over an hour away. To take a shuttle through them it would cost over $200 dollars to get to and from the hotel. Then they offer park passes to Universal Studios. So I purchased them. Well the hotel is in Disney the hotel does offer a shuttle to Universal. This was supposed to be a pleasant trip to help us cope with the anniversary of my daughter's death who passed away a year ago. I thought this would be a good thing. But now we can't even take off from Allentown because the plane has a mechanical problem and now we are delayed for hours. I should have flown with United Airlines.",-1
2017-02-13,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Oakland,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,3,airline got the job done,False," Phoenix to Oakland with Allegiant Air. This airline got the job done. Simple as that. Customer Service over the phone is terrible. I've spent a collective 3 hours trying to get in contact with a representative. Speaking with the workers of Allegiant at the airport, they even confirmed that trying to contact Customer Service over the phone was an average 45 minutes to an hour. Ridiculous. The flight attendants were great people. I would recommend this airline, but only to those who understand that it's not going to be a great experience if they run into issues and need to contact customer service.",1
2017-02-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Richmond,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,stop charging for normal seating,False,"  Tampa Clearwater to Richmond. Allegiant Air should stop charging people for normal seating. Everyone, naturally, chooses the most inexpensive seats. So I'm sitting in this plane that is half empty and everyone is jammed into the back of the plane!! The entire front half of the plane is empty. You have the stewardess monitoring each persons seats. Once the flight was airborne there was a mass exodus as people were finally allowed to redistribute themselves more comfortably throughput the cabin. This is dangerous and stupid!",-1
2017-02-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to OAK,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,flight rescheduled several times,False," Las Vegas to Oakland with Allegiant Air. Worst service. It will be my first and last to ride on this airline. Spent 6 hours at the airport, flight was rescheduled several times then cancelled at 9:30 PM and rescheduled the next day. Missing my family occasion and work. No meal ticket, no hotel voucher. Staff are not friendly even in the plane. Poor customer service and will not recommend.",-1
2017-02-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,OAK to LAS,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3,not for people used to reliable airlines,False," This is my first and last time flying with Allegiant. I booked a flight from Las Vegas to Oakland round trip. First, they hit you with hidden seat fees, bumping the cost up already by a good 12-30 dollars depending on where you want to sit. I got no updates on the 1.5 hour delays of both flights until I checked the Allegiant app. Other airlines typically notify you through email. My flight back to Vegas was cancelled outright as we were all supposed to board. No compensation and the earliest flight they could get was the next day at 5pm. Allegiant workers also informed us that since they do not partner with any airline there was nothing else they could do about the flight. No apologies. Allegiant would be ideal for people who carry no bags and who have flexible travel time, but it's definitely not for people who are used to reliable airlines.",-1
2017-02-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Stockton to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,no refund or voucher,False,"  Stockton to Las Vegas. I book today at 3:23pm for a flight leaving at 4:53pm. I chose an emailed paperless boarding pass. Rules suggest 2 hours early, 45 min for check baggage and 20 min prior to boarding for carry on with boarding pass. I arrived at 4:20pm with no one at the ticket counter. People were still boarding. I was turned away due to ""just an emailed itinerary "" not a boarding pass' told I was too late to do it with an app. I was told I should have come 2 hours early. Why was my flight even allowed to book online if that's the case? To keep my money? Why then did the plane leave 15 min early? No refund or voucher! No answer when called on customer phone. Rediculous! Never try that again.",-1
2017-01-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Casper to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,horrible customer service,False,"  Casper, Wyoming to Las Vegas return. Our experience with Allegiant was terrible from start to finish. Our flight was delayed in Casper for nearly 3 hours, and the ""manager"" (I use that term very loosely) was unaware of the delay until informed by passengers on the plane. She was extremely unprofessional, as were the other employees working the check in counter. They were talking loudly amongst themselves, eating and drinking and goofing off while there were people in line, waiting to be checked in. They could barely be bothered to even converse with the customers. After we finally made it through security, this ""manager"" was completely confused as to why everyone was now waiting at the gate. She was sitting in a wheelchair (one that is intended for handicap passengers, as she has no walking impediment) wheeling herself and kicking herself around the terminal in said wheelchair, all the while addressing the passengers and others in the room, making sure we were aware that she was indeed the manager and that she was completely unaware and uninformed about when the plane would arrive and what was causing the delay to begin with. It was then learned amongst the passengers in the room that this ""manager"" had called several of the passengers of the plane and informed them of the delay and then we had an extended wait time because those passengers hadn't arrived yet. Once on the airplane we had a horrible ascent, and descent. Once we arrived at our destination, we arrived 3 hours passed our schedule arrival time. Because of this, our car rental reservation was canceled and we were stranded in Las Vegas with no car and no cell phones. On the return flight, our flight time was moved up by 2 hours without our knowledge and we nearly missed our flight, and after rushing everyone onto the plane, we proceeded to sit on the plane and wait for them to ""fix"" whatever was wrong for the aircraft for the next hour, at which time we now needed more fuel prior to take off. I will never fly with Allegiant ever again. Horrible customer service.",-1
2017-01-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,IWA to SCK,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,terrible first experience,False,"  Phoenix Mesa to Stockton. Terrible, terrible first experience. The airline staff was rude after we found out the airplane couldn't land due to fog in Stockton. They get on the announcer to tell everyone that they will provide water but just some water and if you wanted a bottle you would have to purchase it. No water, no snacks throughout the flight and with the airplane in hold mode in the air for another good hour before flying to next airport to refuel. They go skimpy on water? People were up in the morning at 4am to get to the airport and board at 6am. Not thinking we don't get water or even a snack. It would have been bettter if the lady that made the announcement was a bit more human instead of a person that sounded like they only cared about making a sale. We land a new airport only to be delayed 2 more hours before flying back to Stockton CA. Get back on the plane and staff again (same people) sounded like they dont care anymore. They had to do a head count. 3 members did the count and had different numbers! I guess they couldn't do basic math. How do you mess that up. Its not like anyone got up and did some magic trick to play with them. So we sat on the plane another good 20 mins before take off.  Passengers were getting very restless at this point after all the delays. A two hour flight turned into a 8 hour ordeal! I can keep going on and on about them but I wont.  Pay the extra 100 bucks and fly right into Sacramento if that is where you're going in the first place.",-1
2017-01-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Belleville,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,extremely slow to provide updates,False,"  Allegiant Air canceled our return flight home from Las Vegas to Belleville and was extremely slow to provide updates as to when the next flight out would be. Over 2 hours after the flight was canceled, all they had told us was that the flight would be the next day. No times provided. As for vouchers, they provided an $8 airport food voucher for people to use for both lunch and dinner. $8 at the airport will cover a cup of coffee and maybe a muffin. Thanks, Allegiant. They are also providing overnight accommodation, however they are not willing to help people find other flights. Horrible airline!",-1

I am never going to fly this airline again, I have to rent a car with my family to drive 16 hours from Bellingham WA to Oakland, there are no phone numbers to call no one at checkin counters, no one answers my email.

In the first place, the flight was delayed to 1pm instead of 8am. The problem is that the employees told me to wait at the wrong gate for the delayed flight to Missoula. When I realized it was the wrong gate, I asked them again if it was the right gate but they told me the flight had just left. Then they started to treat me poorly, they did not seem empathetic at all about the fact that I had missed my flight and even laughed in front of me. This was very upsetting given the fact that I missed my flight entirely because of their mistake. They also failed to help me find another flight until I continually asked for their assistance. They finally found me a flight in another city of Montana which was Great Falls. So, the inconvenience cost me a night in a hotel and transportation to go to Missoula.",-1
2017-01-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Las Vegas,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,ridicule and rudeness of staff,False,"  My family (Husband, 15 month old daugher and myself) flew from Kansas City to Las Vegas on 12/22. Our flight attendant was more than rude and unprofessional. We were seated in the first row on the plane. We had bought our 15 month old her own seat so my husband, our daughter and myself had our own space. Our daughter was having trouble adapting to a confined space and was having a meltdown. My husband and I were trying everything we could to help soothe her during our initial taxi. The FA was on a huge power trip. Traveling with a toddler is stressful and not pleasant for anyone. She was lecturing us and talking down to us the entire flight was unnecessary and in poor taste. I was on the verge of tears by the time we landed because she wouldn't stop meddling in our situation. On our way home, we flew from Las Vegas to Rapid City, SD on 12/27. The universe must've been working against us since the same FA was on our return flight. This time my husband was seated in the exit row and my daughter and I were seated catty-corner behind him to his left. During initial prep, the FA had asked the exit row customers the routine ""incase of an emergency"" questions. My husband answered yes, he was willing and able. Half way through our flight my husband and I had traded spots as we switched off entertaining our daughter. One FA stopped at the exit row and told me I would need to pay for the seat if I was going to sit there. I explained to her we had already purchased the seat and were switching for a few minutes. The FA proceeded to make her way back to plane a few minutes after my conversation with the first flight attendant. She told me I wasn't allowed to sit there as she didn't initially brief me. I told her I understood and that I would switch seats with my husband. She returned 2 minutes later and had asked me if we had paid for the seat my daughter was sitting in. I said ""yes."" I'm upset because as a lead flight attendant, it's her job to know which seats are vacant and half way through a flight she was questioning us. 3 minutes pass and she approaches my husband who is now back in the exit row. She explains to him that she didn't brief him during the initial briefing and that he would need to be reseated. She also mentioned that if something were to happen during the flight and the FAA were to find out she allowed someone to sit there who wasn't briefed, she would be in a lot of trouble. To me, this all sounds again like her problem and again not knowing which seats are paid for and occupied. My husband said he would be reseated. She then proceeded to tell him that he wasn't allowed to move because the seat belt sign was on. So she briefed him while standing there and asked for a verbal confirmation. She then ended the conversation with ""in the future, don't sit in an exit row."" For the later half of our flight, she 3 times came back to talk to us and made us feel like we were trying to short change the company by stealing seats. She was on a complete power trip and was very unprofessional. In the future, I will pay double the amount of money to fly on a better and classier airline that Allegiant. It's not worth the ridicule and rudeness of their staff.",-1
2017-01-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,FLL to CVG,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,overall terrible experience,False," Fort Lauderdale to Cincinnati. Allegiant Air got everyone on board, but before take-off the captain informed us a service light came on which required maintenance. This problem took over an hour to be fixed, the captain gave insufficient updates and let the cabin get extremely hot for long periods of time. Just an overall terrible experience. Flight attendants were not in proper uniform, shirts torn up, not tucked in, one attendant appeared as if they didn't want to give any instructions. Aside from their ridiculous bag fees, this is equally terrible service. If needed pay the extra and avoid Allegiant by all means, especially if you are traveling with children and/or seniors.",-1
2017-01-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Sanford Orlando to Memphis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,were stranded at the airport,False,"  Sanford Orlando to Memphis. We booked a flight and a car through Allegiant Air one week in advance. Flight was over 1 hour late, the plane was nasty inside, lights kept flickering and the intercom didn't work half the time. We had reserved side by side seats, but our plane broke down they gave a substitute plane and separated us! We paid for premium and found our car was booked but not paid for! Enterprise doesn't accept a debit card for a one way rental and they don't take cash. We were stranded at the airport. Everything was shut down. Only a drink machine. I am disabled, so my husband was helping me and managing bags. Called Allegiant Air and was on hold for over 45 minutes. We can't get any money back, they will issue us a voucher. Heaven help you if you choose this company!",-1
2017-01-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SAN to PVU,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,every time it gets delayed,False,"  San Diego to Provo, UT. Allegiant Air is awful! Every time I try and fly this airline it gets delayed, they'll tell you it's delayed 15 minutes, every 15 minutes, for 2 hours, until they eventually just cancel the whole flight. I am so disgusted by how this airline is run and it makes no sense why they would be so disrespectful to their frustrated customers as well. Learn how to run your business and get better employees. If I could give this airline no stars, I would.",-1
2017-01-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to TUL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,not worth the headache,False," Horrible airline and customer service. Do not fly Allegiant Air. Pay the extra money and fly a dependable, reputable airline. My flight from Los Angeles to Tulsa was delayed three hours, then once landed, sat on the tarmac for an hour because the flight leaving out of Tulsa was delayed (shocking) and there wasn't another gate for Allegiant. Apparently they only have one gate. Cut to - my return flight from Tulsa to LAX. Was ""on time"" until five minutes after the flight was supposed to depart Tulsa, then the monitor changed to ""delayed."" Once again, for three hours. Once the flight landed in Tulsa, three hours later (our plane to take us back to Los Angeles), they announced that the flight was cancelled and was being rescheduled for the following day. No time of reschedule, no hotel vouchers. Basically, we can do nothing and we really don't care what you do until the flight is rescheduled. Oh, and by the way, go back to baggage claim to pick up your checked bags. Thanks for nothing Allegiant. You most likely lost several customers tonight. Your unreliability is just not worth the headache.",-1
2017-01-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PVU to AZA,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,you get what you pay for,False,"  2 round trip flights with Allegiant where all four flights have been delayed between 1.5 to 7 hours. My last flight was delayed two hours because they ""had forgotten to fill out some paperwork"". Engine was fine, landing gear was fine, paperwork was the reason all the passengers boarded half an hour late and took off two hours later. I received a notification that my flight had been delayed while I had already been on the aircraft for an hour and a half. After all that, all food was still for purchase only. I was livid, and it would be okay if this was a one time thing. It has now happened on 4/4 flights. They better keep this airline cheap, because that's really the only thing that ever keeps anyone coming back to fly with Allegiant. You get what you pay for, but if you pay just a little bit more, the quality of service is 100x better.",-1
2017-01-03,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,EWR to SAV,5.0,,4.0,,,4.0,5,definitely use them again,False,"  Newark to Savannah. Allegiant Air is a very good budget airline. As you would expect, you will pay extra for even carry-on bags, but since that's known, the net final payment for a round trip ticket was really quite good. What we also got (a very pleasant surprise( was good legroom. I am 6' 6"", with a 36"" inseam - this was a really comfortable seat and there was plenty of room between my knees and the seatback in front of me. Our round-trip, Newark to Savannah, was really good and on-time. We'll definitely use them again!",1
2017-01-02,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,GRR to FLL,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,3,hats off to hard working employees,False,"  Grand Rapids to Fort Lauderdale. I just reached my final Florida destination via Allegiant Air. I believe other postings of Flight 1729 gives a pretty good description of a New Years Eve we will never forget. I believe I take another view on how the crew on the flight and the ground crew handled this event. First if the captain refused to question the inspection we may not be here to complain. The crew did hand out snacks and juice to drink. They used what they had, and kept their stress under control considering the flack they had to endure. We needed to add fuel, because the captain kept the engines running to maintain our comfort. Our cell phones were receiving updates all evening our flight was resumed the next day. Trust me by the time we got to the hotel Allegiant Air put us up in we managed to only get 3 hrs sleep. But the ground crew returned the next morning to check us in, with less sleep. Our compensation $100.00 voucher was not adequate. So hats off to hard working employees of Allegiant Air Grand Rapids. However management missed it opportunity to make it right to all of us on Flight 1729.",-1
2017-01-02,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,PGD to LCK,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,2,is not family friendly,False,"  Punta Gorda to Rickenbacker. Allegiant Air is not family friendly and staff don't seem to know FAA regulations. It started with the gate agent in Punta Gorda who tried to close boarding 30 minutes prior to departure as I was heating my infant's bottle 10 feet from the gate. She threatened to close the door on me and my family, even though it says they don't close boarding until 15 mins prior to departure. She continued to verbally threaten me for the 5 minutes it took to heat the bottle, which still left us boarding 25 mins prior to departure. Once we boarded the plane, a flight attendant tried to tell us that we couldn't have 2 car seats in the same row on the same side of the aisle, even though regulations say you can as long as the adult sits in the aisle seat. They continued to have us move the car seat 2 more times, once across the aisle and then they decided that wasn't good enough so they asked my husband to take one of the car seats to the back of the plane and seperate our family. At this point they were claiming ""weight distribution"". I demanded to sit with my family, and after further insistence, I and my 2 year old were allowed to go sit with my husband and 11 month old in the back of the plane. On a flight at 7:45am on New Year's Day that was 50% empty. It was clear to me that they were simply trying to relegate us to the back of the aircraft, even though on Allegiant you pay more money for better seats that are more forward in the aircraft. And it was also clear that they either have no clue what the FAA regulations are regarding car seats, or were lying to have an excuse to move us, and I'm not sure which is worse. If you're traveling with small children, steer clear.",-1

Finally get to destination and I have been on the plane now waiting to get to our gate for 52 mins so far. I have a service dog and he has not been able to relieve himself for going on 10 hours now.

On the way to the airport we get an alarm notice that the plane was delayed until 10:00pm. So we went to dinner. At dinner got an another notice the plane was delay until 10:30. Always so many damn delays with this airline. Already checked in we get to the airport in Asheville North Carolina at 9:10pm and now found out the Security Group shuts down at 9pm and unable to get on the plane. I will never fly this airline again. It made be cheap but damn all the delays. My longest delay so far as been 7 hours and others 3 to 4 hours. The planes are very old, seats suck. Went to use the bathroom the panel were held together with tape. So no more flying this airline. I will just pray for the ones that do.",-1

Well got sucked into a ""deal"" only this time we were delayed 5 hours on our departure. On our flight back we received notice that our flight was canceled and we wouldn't depart until the next day. They could do nothing for us but a $100 voucher. Had to spend $600 on different airlines to come home.",-1

Waiting to find out why my flight was cancelled just a few hours before boarding. Weather is clear but I've been in line for an hour and it hasn't moved.

Allegiant Air left me stranded with my 4 month old baby the week of Christmas. My flight home was cancelled two hours before departure and they offered no other flights for 3-5 days. My family had to drive 6 hours away to get my husband home so he wouldn't lose his job, while I had no choice but to wait days for the next flight as he got the very last seat to FL with Allegiant. We couldn't afford another airline and spent our baby's first Christmas with her grandparents. We will not fly with Allegiant Air again.",-1
2016-12-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MSY to PIE,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,sorry excuse for an airline,False,"  New Orleans to Tampa Bay. I'm so disappointed with this sorry excuse for an airline, I don't even know where to begin. I'm honestly surprised they are still in business. We got to the airport and there were three desk assistants, only one had the slightest clue as to how to assist customers. The other two just seemed to be there for decoration. The flight was pushed back twice and then finally canceled. Everyone was told to go to the desk to get hotel and food vouchers and rearrange flight. The crew could not tell us where we would be staying for the evening, nor when we would be able to fly out, so we weren't comfortable making our own accommodations in the event it was an early morning departure. We waited and we waited at 11 at night with absolutely no information. When one man demanded some information and voiced the ridiculousness of the situation, they called security on him. Then there were so many people being sent to the same hotel, we had to wait over an hour in line for a shuttle. We were told it was just across the street. We finally took a cab. 38 bucks later, it was not just across the street. When we finally made it to the hotel, it was pandemonium. It was like a scene from the twilight zone. Allegiant, your company and it affiliates are an embarrassment to our consumer driven economy.",-1
2016-12-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,AZA to IDA,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,avoid this airline like the plague,False,"  My family and I were supposed to travel from the Phoenix-Mesa to Idaho Falls, Idaho. Our flight was scheduled as On Time and without delays, but after we boarded we were told to disembark because, according to the flight attendant, the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls wasn't working. We waited in the airport for 1.5 hours before we were told to board the plane again. Everyone boarded and waited on the plane an additional 45 minutes until the pilot said the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls still wasn't working. We disembarked again and this time most of the passengers were anxious for a better explanation. An Alegiant worker finally admitted that the de-icer truck in Idaho Falls hadn't been working for a few days and two Allegiant planes were already stranded in Idaho Falls. Many passengers were frustrated, but all the passengers were told to just leave because no one at the airport could answer any questions. There were people who had to get to work the next day and kids were crying because they couldn't spend Christmas with family that night- including my 10 year-old. What I don't understand is, if the de-icer in Idaho Falls hadn't been working and planes were already stranded there, why weren't we notified before we arrived at the airport? Anyway, I called a number an Allegiant worker had written on a small piece of paper and I waited on hold for over 30 minutes before my wife discovered the number I was given was a generic number. Allegiant couldn't even give me a good number to call, so that I could resolve this issue. After hanging up and calling a different number I was ultimately told the next flight was four days away. I argued for a refund and was given that, including a refund of all the nickel and dime charges Allegiant gets you with (at least the refund was a plus). Avoid this airline like the plague unless you can be very flexible with your time and you are willing to put up with inferior customer service in order to save a buck.",-1
2016-12-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BWI to ATL,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the worst flight experience,False,"  Baltimore to Atlanta. The worst flight experience in all of my 48 years! Upon check-in, only one person was able to check people in and the other 3 people were clueless. After finally getting checked in, we headed down to the gate at which point we were told that my son could not fly, as he was an unaccompanied minor and his destination was heavy with fog. No apologies, only ""go back to the ticket counter to rebook a flight."" The next flight to Georgia is in 3 days! Fine. We took the flight, four days with his dad is better than none. What about his luggage? We were told to wait at luggage carousel 11. An hour after the flight left we got his luggage. According to one of the agents, they were grossly short-staffed so our bag had to sit on the tarmac and wait for one of their available employees to pick it up. Unbelievable.",-1

I can buy a ticket but if I want to have a seat it is going to cost extra. They charge $50 per bag (this includes your first bag) to use the overhead bin. The seats were new but did not adjust at all. I understand that they are a bargain basement airline so I wasn't expecting any extras but they still managed to disappoint. Their ticket was advertised about $100 cheaper, ended up being $45 cheaper after their nickel and diming, but in the future I would be willing to pay the $100 premium not to fly with them.",-1

2016-12-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,USA to SFB,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,2.0,4,never been more uncomfortable,False,"  Concord, NC to Orlando/Sanford. I have flown this twice in the past month. As a veteran flyer I can safely say that I have never been more uncomfortable on a flight. The seats on the plane are molded plastic with no capability of reclining, very thin, hard padding and packed so closely that my knees literally touched the seat in front of me the entire flight. I was so uncomfortable that my back started hurting before we even started taxiing. Add to this the constant added charges, checked bags, carry-on bags, selecting your own seat, printing boarding passes etc make it very frustrating to even try to book a flight. Then, they don't even offer a free cup of water on the flight. Any food or drinks are overly expensive and must be paid for by credit card. The attendants, while not rude, weren't exactly pleasant to communicate with. The only good things I can say is  the price of the ticket, if you get away without all the extra charges, is very inexpensive, and the location of the terminals is a bit easier to get around in than the larger international airports like Charlotte or Orlando. I usually enjoy air travel, but in this case I definitely make an exception.",-1

2016-12-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,LAS to DSM,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,we should be able to sit together,False,"  If we purchase tickets together we should be able to sit together. However Allegiant would rather scam you out of more money to change your seat just so you can sit with the people you are vacationing with. I would understand if the tickets were purchased separately, but they were not. The flights were not full so there is no valid reasoning for this other than to scam people out if more money. This is the 2nd bad experience I have had with Allegiant Air and I can't think of any good reason to fly with them again. They advertise to be a cheap flight, which if it wasn't for all the hidden costs would be true. The attendents at the gate were extremely rude when we left Las Vegas. A trip should be relaxing, all of it was except dealing with this airline and their rude attendants. Flight 496 to Des Moines from Vegas 12/9/16. They even try to charge $5 for printing a piece of paper. Last time I went to Vegas my flight got delayed after we were already boarded because we were waiting for one passenger. Said passenger got on, we started to leave and then we had to pull back in just to let her off because she was too intoxicated. This left all passengers on the plane in 105 degree weather for an hour and a half. But yet I cant get a seat next to the person I'm flying with without paying another $100 round trip when they had 40 open seats on the aircraft for our return flight.",-1
2016-11-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SFB to RFD,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"terrible, unreliable airline",False,"  Sanford to Rockford. Terrible, unreliable airline. Boarded our plane nearly an hour late with no explanation, only to sit on the plane for an hour to find out the plane is broken! After deboarding the broken plane (an issue which Allegiant is apparently known for because of older aircraft), we were directed off the plane with no further instruction. Eventually they redirected us to another gate and another plane, which was out of fuel. After further waiting on the runway (this plane didn't even have air conditioning even though we were in Orlando), we eventually left over 2 hours after our planned departure time. They left passengers largely uninformed through the entire debacle, and didn't offer any apology. Would never recommend this airline to anyone who had to get somewhere in any timely manner, and God help you if you have a connecting flight! While waiting to board I met some of the other passengers on my flight who had similar complaints about the airline. No one had any positive feedback on Allegiant.",-1
2016-11-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to MFR,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the worst airline by far,False,"  Allegiant Air is the worst airline by far. My nephew was to fly home from Los Angeles to Medford. The airline has a policy that under 18 cannot fly if a weather advisory. Knowing this, I asked if I would be notified for an advisory prior to arrival. I checked the flight status prior to leaving and was listed as on time, no email or calls of an advisory. Drove the two hours to LAX and was told due to an advisory that he could not fly, and I could try again in four days. Calling the customer support I was told they could only talk to my nephew because they considered him an adult, and he would have to make reservation changes. Wow, ironic they will not let him fly alone but is responsible enough to make reservation changes.",-1

2016-11-03,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CVG to BWI,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,the value for money is excellent,False," Cincinnati to Baltimore. Allegiant Air is awesome. Their presence at CVG opens up many opportunities to fly nonstop on a limited budget or limited time. One hour in the air versus one day of driving saves me one day of PTO, or a vacation one day longer. I'm a very frequent flier on several airlines, and the value for money with Allegiant is excellent. I prefer a la carte pricing. Since I'm normally carry-on-only, I don't want to pay for someone else's checked luggage, but I'm more than happy to pay a little extra for legroom and priority boarding - both of which were well worth the money. I skipped to the front of the line while checking my bag (the $6 I paid for priority boarding includes priority check-in / bag check), and had enormous legroom in my seat. Frequent flier hack: I found that I could get a cheaper international ticket on a mainline airline out of Washington DC than I could via anywhere in Ohio so I took Allegiant to BWI, then continued on from there to England. Saved $500 that way! On discount airlines (Frontier/Allegiant), I always tip the flight attendants, they are very grateful, and I never go thirsty.",1

This is the worst airline I've ever been on. Flight landed over 45 mins ago and we're still waiting on our luggage. They nickel and dime you through the whole process. It cost more for our baggage then it for the tickets. Staff were rude and unfriendly. We will never fly this airline again. I'm sticking with Southwest.,-1
2016-10-24,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SFB to GSP,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,4,definitely recommend flying them,False,"  Orlando Sanford to Greenville-Spartanburg.  First off, I did a dumb thing and booked our flight backwards. I called and they switched it with no problem for the cost of the difference of the tickets and did not charge the change fee. Second, we went down to Orlando when Hurricane Matthew hit. We did not want to stay during the hurricane since we have a four year old and a one year old who would have been scared to death. I was afraid for our safety as well. Allegiant switched the flight free of charge. We were able to fly out safe and sound quite literally right before the storm hit. All flights had been canceled after 10. We were supposed to fly out at 7:20, but the pilots had been delayed. We flew out at 11 and thankfully had little turbulence. I definitely recommend flying them again!",1
2016-10-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SFB to ROA,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,savings are not worth the hassle,False, My family and I were traveling from Orlando to Roanoke with Allegiant Air. We got there 2 hours before takeoff. In total we were waiting at the airport 6 hours. They delayed the flight 3 times in 1 hour increments before finally canceling the flight. No one at the airline had any information about what was happening and some of the workers were just making it up as they went along. The savings are not worth the hassle. I'm hearing from everyone around this area that this happens once a week.,-1
2016-10-15,1.0,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,SYR to FLL,4.0,,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5,very happy with everything,False," Syracuse to Fort Lauderdale with Allegiant Air. After reading the reviews here I was skeptical but given the direct flight and price I decided to take a chance. I was very happy with everything. The weight limit for suitcases was less than other airlines at only 40 pounds and you need to indicate in advance how much checked and carry on items you are bringing and pay for them. Although I paid for carry on I didn't see anyone checking this. You need to print your boarding pass in advance or they charge you $5 at the airport per person. The flight boarded on time and was turned around quickly. They board from the back forward unless you buy priority boarding. I paid for the premium economy seat and it was comfortable. They don't recline but they start out partially reclined so it was comfortable and there was decent room. It was an older plane retrofitted but I was happy with it. I would recommend this airline and I would fly them again. In Europe many of the discount airlines have similar policies so you need to read the fine print and follow their rules but all in all, a good airline, great to fly direct and great price. It's no frills though. No TV, no wifi. But for a short direct flight its worth the trade off. Hopefully they will get wifi on the flights in the future.",1

When we returned to Tulsa from Las Vegas we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac for 2.5 hours before they let us off. Something about the plane at the gate had to have a tire changed. In this time they served us a 1/4 cup of nuts and a 1/2 cup of warm water. We sat on the tarmac longer than our flight was. The fares look good at first - until the ""add-ons"" start. Just fly Southwest.",-1

They sent us an email telling us that our flights were cancelled and will not be replaced. They promised a credit within 72 hours. Email sent october 4th, no credit yet. Because they are impossible to reach, I booked a flight from where the ship rerouted us (FLL instead of SFB which was the cancelled ticket) while expecting the first flight to be refunded. Dont try to call them ever: I have spent 1h 45 minutes waiting on line without answer. They dont have a toll free number for customer service and when you call their number, it is a loop where I am convinced, no one is at the other end. They charge for everything, which if you calculate, it may end up costing you more that a real airline. The airport and inflight personnel are fine. The flight went well, but putrid, inacceptable service.",-1

I have been flying for over 40 years regularly and this is by far the worst airline I have ever experienced. They have a direct flight from Syracuse to St Petersburg, after the first couple times of 4 to 6 hour delays we thought we'd give it one more try (the only other non-stop is out of Rochester an hour and a half away). We are currently stuck in St Petersburg Clearwater Airport with another six hour delay. Again the reason was mechanical. The weather is perfect throughout the United States today so they could not use that excuse. We are waiting for a plane from somewhere else to take us to Syracuse. They do not even know where the plane is coming from so we cannot check the status. We are 0 for 4 on round trip bookings! That's 8 delays. Not one delay less than 3 hours! We will drive over an hour to Rochester take Southwest Airlines direct flight to Tampa and return Southwest to Rochester and drive over an hour to home. Inconvenient but makes me feel better that this airline will never get a dime from me again. Also we have been lied to so many times I will never remember them all.

2016-09-23,0.2,Business,Economy Class,FSD to LAS,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,I have seen a change in the airline,False,"  I have flown Allegiant multiple times in the past because they have multiple flights from Sioux Falls, SD (which has limited options of flights as a small city) to large hubs which can get me pretty much anywhere I want to go. Over the last year I have seen a change in the airline and mood of the staff. They have gone from very friendly and customer orientated to more of a second class airline where the customers are treated like cattle. I have felt better about myself and customer service standing at line in McDonalds. They claim they have low rates, but when you actually get through ticket registration they have so many fees they add up to their competitors. I understand they have a bottom line to protect, but I would rather have an airline be upfront and honest with me. For example, I tried to put my personal item (which was a very full backpack, as I had two laptops in there for a business trip) in an overhead bin. I was one of the last ones on the plane and the flight attendant told me I couldn't put it in there as I didn't pay for the storage space and I had to keep it in front of me. Even though there were open spaces and no one else boarding the plane. I will personally never fly this airline again as they are not cheaper than there competitors and they are far less customer orientated than other flights in their price range.",-1

Flight attendants do nothing except try to sell you food and drinks. Will never fly them after this. We asked for wheelchair assistance at end of flight but they had none - another airline helped us and got us that help. Again, how hard can this be when you request it with your tickets?

Pretty outrageous costs for checked baggage and cabin baggage but I guess I can handle this. The thing that annoyed me was the checkin process. My partner and I had booked flights in the same booking and when proceeding to check in both on the app or at the airport, we were seated separated from each other, unless we paid a fee of $12 USD each to pick a seat. We checked in very early and it would have been easy to just put us together but they wouldn't do it at the counter unless we paid. To me, this is extremely disappointing and terrible customer service.",-1

2016-08-07,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SFB to BMI,,,,,,3.0,3,all seats got switched around,False,"  We are getting ready to board a flight from Sanford, Florida to Bloomington, IL. We checked in last night & were assigned row 23 with all 3 family members together. When we got to the check-in we noticed that we got bumped back to rows 28 & 29. We mentioned something to the guy at the counter & he said they needed to downgrade us on the plane so all seats got switched around. I mentioned I really hate being in the back of the plane & he let me know it wasnt the back. I mentioned it was three rows from it & (again empathy at its best) well its not the back. He also said we are all still together which we are not. I have a fear of enclosed spaces & being towards the back of the plane. 5 or so rows might not seem like a lot to a ticket agent or being in separate rows but they could at least have a bit more empathy & customer service. Why have early check-in if you are going to move us around anyways?! Not impressed with Allegiant Air at all. As I am writing this post my husband went to talk with the agent at the gate & she was fabulous. We are not all together but I have a seat in row 6 now. Thank you Rebollo & my husband!",-1

2016-08-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,PI to PGD,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,first and last experience with Allegiant,False,"  Their motto should be ""our fares are cheap so we don't care if you enjoy the flight"". This was my first and last experience with Allegiant Air. I booked a one way reservation departing Pittsburgh and arriving at Punta Gorda, scheduled take off at 2:11pm. The online check in advertised as ""skip the lines"" is a joke because you still have to check your luggage at the ticket counter - where two people are staffed to assist a line of 100+ passengers. At 1:15, passengers who had the mobile app received text messages stating that the flight was delayed until 4:40. Passengers who did not have the app were confused because the screens at the gate and the mobile app itself did not reflect the delay. There was no Allegiant Air representative at the gate to provide clarification, so after 2:11 came and went, it was obvious that the delay was legit. At 3:30, an Allegiant air rep arrived at the gate and announced that our plane was due to land at 4:30, and that everybody needed to hurry up and board the plane after the passengers were released. At 4:00 the Allegiant attendant announced for everyone to ""be quiet and listen up"" because the plane was going to be a little later because of ""storms"" - and suggested that we look at weather radar to confirm the weather patterns. The plane landed at 5:00, and we were told that they needed to clean the plane before boarding. At 5:20 they started boarding special needs and priority passengers and told every one else not to get in line until their zone was called. Once they called for zone two, where people had already started lining up, an attendant again reminded us to ""be quiet and listen up"" and then said that we needed to hurry up and start boarding or else the flight would be canceled(?). They also told passengers for the flight to Orlando that was currently posted at our gate, that they needed to go to an alternate gate. A few of us brought it to representatives attention that the posted flight and time for Orlando on the screens were showing that it was departing from our gate, we were told that they didn't have anyone to change the information - so of course people who arrived at the gate after the announcement boarded the plane (oddly, not discovered at the gate by the attendants), and further delayed our take off as they were removed after everyone else was seated. Then at 5:45, the captain apologized for the delay, citing that they had some mechanical problems in Myrtle Beach (weren't the delays caused by ""storms""? The Allegiant rep even emphasized that we validate the presence of storms on the radar, guess that was a little white lie). Then the captain started yapping something about the fact that if we weren't airborne in exactly 15 minutes, the legal flight hours for the pilots would be exceeded and they would have to cancel the flight.  We literally lifted off with one minute to spare, and the cabin actually erupted with passengers clapping and saying how bad this airline was.",-1
2016-08-01,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TUL to MSY,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,negative reviews were unfounded,False,"  Tulsa to New Orleans. I just completed flight 1 of a 2 flight trip. I spent time reading many Allegiant reviews just before boarding, and I can say the negative reviews were unfounded. I boarded the plane, flew to my destination and disembarked. It met my minimal expectations, I got that for which I paid. Job well done. The flight was delayed 30-45 mins but I was informed of that before I left my house. As other reviews have indicated this is an ala carte experience. Anything beyond getting a seat on the plane will cost you. Read website info carefully to minimize extra charges. We did experience some charges but still a very reasonable cost. I will make a return flight in a few days and provide an update.",1
2016-07-31,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FCA to LAS,3.0,,3.0,,,2.0,3,better than previous trip,False," Kalispell to Las Vegas with Allegiant Air. Better than my previous trip. Both flights were on time. Flight from Kalispell was actually a charter plane (Sun Country) as Allegiant had no planes available. This meant no beverage or snack service was available on the flight. Return flight was on time and we ran into no issues. I do hate the nickle and dime attitude of the airline (paying for carry on luggage, paying to print a boarding pass etc) but they got me where I was going at the time promised. Plane was reasonably comfortable. Staff friendly enough but could use some customer service training. They preferred to spend time chatting amongst themselves at the front of the plane as opposed to serving passengers.",-1
2016-07-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,FSD to LAS,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,Allegiant is a horrible airline,False,  Our last 2 flights from Sioux Falls to Las Vegas have been canceled. The first time they told us there was no crew and the 2nd the excuse was mechanical issues. In both situations we couldn't leave until the following day. We were given $100 vouchers which sort of traps you into feeling like need to book with them again to use it but it's not worth it. As already mentioned in several reviews the cost incurred from their totally unreliable service generally exceeds the money you think you are saving when you buy their tickets--even with the $100 voucher. We're out over $600 between our hotel room and show tickets for a show we can't attend now because our rescheduled flight the day after we were supposed to leave doesn't take off until 6pm--if it actually ends up leaving at all. It seems to be a real crap shoot. In talking with others at the airport nearly everyone had stories of being burned by flight cancellations. Allegiant has no concern for the fact they are destroying vacation plans that in most cases people have been looking forward to for months. Bottom line is that Allegiant is a horrible airline that sells you tickets for services they can't provide.,-1

Return flight delayed 3 hrs and counting due to the plane allegedly having no functioning lavatory. According to the terminal attendant, ""We won't be taking the original plane. They just haven't found another plane yet."" Nickel and diming the not so savvy traveler with bag fees for every situation imaginable. I'm glad my wife and me educated ourselves about Allegiant's policies beforehand. Don't be a victim. Handful of Wheat Thins - there's a charge for that. If you're going cheap, go Southwest if possible. Work a few more hours to make up the $100-200 cost difference - it's still far and away the better affordable airline.",-1

I endured a 2 day weekend of nothing but delays and an eventual cancellation of flight due to mechanical issues. This wouldn’t have been so bad if I was traveling by myself, but I had a handful of kids in-tow. What good does it do to buy cheap airfare tickets if the airline cannot get one to the destination on time or even in a timely manner? This 2 day delay had a devastating ripple effect throughout my entire 7 day itinerary. It seems that this company can’t keep track of its own pilots. Allegiant flew a different plane in to DSM only to find out that the pilots were out of air time. Here is a working airplane, but no one to fly it. What kills me is that the company is military strict on checked baggage weight, but it asks flyers to open the air vents and click the seatbelts before deplaning. I have strict flying rules too. Make me unload 3 lbs. from my checked luggage into my personal carry-on at the check-in stand (on a return trip no less) and you can click your own seatbelts and close window shades behind me.",-1

I am at the gate now and flight from St Petersburg FL to Grand Rapids is 1 hour late again. This was the first flight of the day and you would expect it to be ready. It wasnt. Next, they advertise as a budget airline. That is only because they charge you for everything. Boarding passes are $5.00. Water or soda $2.00. The cost of the flight advertised did not include taxes.

To get started we were delayed 3.5 hours on 7/7/16 to then have our flight cancelled. We were told flight was moved to 8am on 7/8/16. No big deal except when we arrived and went through security at 7am we were told by airport staff Allegiant mechanics had not shown up and our flight crew were nowhere to be found so again we were delayed another 3 hours. You know what Allegiant did to accommodate everyone? Nothing. We got a 100 voucher for their airline but you really think anyone wants to fly with them now. So fast forwarding to 8/10 our 8.20 return flight. We get to the airport to find out all computers are down, luckily I checked in online. So for starters we expected a small delay. So at about 8.35 we get to board to then sit on the plane until 10.15 before they make everyone get off the plane. Again no accommodations. We finally board and leave at 11.20 - another 3 hour delay.

The very helpful gate agents said a replacement aircraft (an MD83) would arrive at LAX at 4.00pm. The plane arrived on time, but we weren't allowed to board because, ironically, it needed a mechanical part before it could fly. At 7.00pm, a supervisor announced that the flight was cancelled, wouldn't be rescheduled, and no hotel vouchers would be offered. Families with young children and other travelers, myself included, spent the whole day in LAX's crowded and bland Termanil 3, only to be let down by Allegiant.

American Airlines increased their rates for summer travel, so I have opted to fly Allegiant to be more cost effective. My flight from Concord to St Pete was delayed. 3.5 hours.

Because Allegiant does not fly from Concord to Punta Gorda this left me with a 3 hour drive to Southwest Florida or I should say my husband with a six hours drive round trip to pick me up. The flight returning to Concord from St. Pete was delayed again. The 6.15 was delayed until 8.00. At least that's what they are saying at the moment since I'm writing this in real time. No updates were given until 1 hour post our boarding time and they were minimal. A beautiful plane sits on the tarmac with no passengers to board.

No rebooking on other airlines ""per Allegiant policy"". No counter service and non-existent phone service. My family scheduled a quick weekend in Orlando and decided to try Allegiant Air (from Fargo) for the first time due to price, and the convenience of the direct flight. I received a text that the flight was cancelled just as we arrived at the Fargo airport. Mind you, they would have known the flight was cancelled long before that because their only in-bound flight would have been coming from Orlando. No reason was offered and we were given a non-toll free number to call where we sat on hold for a half-hour before being disconnected, then tried again and sat on hold for over an hour before we got to talk to somebody. We opted for the refund and purchased a last-minute, expensive ticket on another airline because we did not have calendar flexibility. Turns out that the return Allegiant flight was also cancelled. My advice: don't be tempted by the low prices.",-1

2016-06-08,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BLI to LAS,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,3,staff is friendly enough,False,"  My Allegiant Air flight from  Bellingham to Las Vegas was scheduled to leave at 527 pm, arrive 8:03 pm. As I arrived at the border, I received a text saying it was delayed until 9pm. Well after more than one delay, we landed in Vegas just after 3am. The delay, it seemed was due to mechanical issues. While it inconvenienced both myself and the person picking me up in Vegas, I would rather have a safe plane than attempt to be on time with a malfunctioning place. And this is not the first time I have had a delay (with other airlines). They emailed out $50 vouchers to the passengers (I haven't had an airline do that before). It's a nuisance that they charge for on board luggage, seat selection, even water, but the other airlines charge for some of those things too. They don't provide the same prices tho. The website is easy to use, and so far, of the flights I took or my friend in Vegas has taken to come up to Bellingham, this is the first incident with Allegiant. Staff is friendly enough, and I am not paying for seat selection, and coming home on the airbus, I managed to sleep a little of the way. No real complaints.",1

The price was great, but we were extremely disappointed. Delayed on the way there an hour as we waited for paperwork to be signed and on the way back, we boarded the plane on time but the engine would not start. They had us in a hot airplane for about an hour and a half while they tried to figure it out. They finally gave up and we were asked to switch to a different plane which took about 30 minutes. For arrival into ABQ we were put in a holding pattern why the local air show was going on. For 40 minutes we were going in circles with a great amount of turbulence. We got to LAS airport for check-in at 7AM and arrived in ABQ at 3PM. We could have drove and been home in the same amount of time.",-1

I had to sit in the airport for 7 hours. They kept adding and subtracting time for the wait. I don't understand why a single direct flight needed so many updates. If they had said to me it was a 7 hour delay from the start I would have come to airport later or left and come back. Communication on the status was back and forth to the point where people stopped listening after the 15th or so update.,-1

Plane had issues, had to wait on the plane for more than one hour before being ""deplaned"".

2016-06-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AZA to FWA,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,2.0,2,seat was fairly uncomfortable,False,"  I flew from Phoenix/Mesa Gateway airport, which is more convenient to my house to Ft Wayne, IN,. The seat was fairly uncomfortable for me, it is the newer style of carbon fiber frame and had very thin seat padding. These seats don’t recline at all, the tray tables are smaller than they used to be and you can’t put anything in the seat back other than papers. You used to be able to put a water bottle or other items in the seat pocket, but no more. This airline charges you for everything, so I’m not sure you are really saving much money on Allegiant. Refreshments cost a minimum of $2 for a can of pop. I normally barely pay that for a 12 pack of pop. Their schedule to Ft Wayne is very limited, making it harder to schedule your stay. And they don’t even fly to Ft Wayne at ALL from 8/13 to 11/15.  Either you are providing service to the city or not. When the pilots gave announcements, we could not hear what he was saying because he talked so softly. I asked the people sitting in my row if they heard what he said, and they could not hear him either. On the return flight, the cabin temperature became very warm inside. I did ask the flight attendant if she could lower the temp, and apparently she did because it became slightly cooler in the cabin. Also on the return flight, after a short while the pilot turned on the seat belt sign and kept it on the entire way back. There were a few bumpy periods during this time, but not the whole way back. He could have turned it off for some of the time so people could move around a bit. I became very antsy in my seat after about 90-120 min of flight. At least the flight did leave very close to on time and arrived on time. All in all, I will check other airlines before I will schedule Allegiant again.",-1

Memphis to Jacksonville with Allegiant Air. We normally fly Delta or American, however Allegiant offered a non-stop flight to Jacksonville FL and the air fare was $75 less. We arrived at the airport at 12:30 (2 hours early as per instructions on the boarding pass). Our flight was due to leave Memphis at 2:40pm and we should have arrived in Jacksonville at approx. 5:15pm. We did not arrive in Jacksonville until after 10pm. During our lengthy stay at the airport we learned that 3 flights altogether had been delayed or cancelled and the reason given for all 3 was mechanical problems. Our return trip did not improve our opinion. Our flight was due to leave Jacksonville at 5:15pm. We did not arrive in Memphis until after 10pm and again we were told it was due to mechanical problems, and again during our stay at the airport we learned that there had been other flights that day that had been delayed by hours and hours due to mechanical problems. We will never fly Allegiant again - I would rather have a layover and pay a little bit more.",1

They charge you extra for everything, there is no customer service, the aircraft is old, loud and uncomfortable.",-1

Terrible customer service and unprofessional flight attendants. This airline has no idea what it is doing. Arrived at airport 1.5 hours before departure only to be notified that flight was delayed 30 minutes. Boarded aircraft 1 hour later and then took another half hour to take off. No explanation given. I paid extra money for priority boarding to stow my bag and the flight attendant then moved it back 3 rows. Unless you don't really care when you arrive or how you are treated this is the airline for you. Otherwise be prepared to get what you paid for, bad service, rude employees and total uncertainty on the time you will reach your destination. I for one have learned my lesson and will never fly this airline again.",-1

Called customer service and was told an email was sent day after booking regarding the change in flight times. No email was sent and another customer verified he received the same story when he called. Return flight was delayed and then cancelled.

2016-05-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,IND to PGD,5.0,,1.0,,,5.0,5,unfriendly to so many,False,"  Indianapolis, Indiana to Punta Gorda. I was stopped with my emotional support dog because my boarding pass said service animal. While at the check in counter I was asked to see my paperwork from my doctor and was given the pass. The problem was I was stopped at the gate by the lady who was scanning all the passes and was asked for my paperwork again and was told that it needed to be changed in the computer there is nothing on your website for emotional support animals. As I was on the verge of tears for being stopped again and showing my paperwork; the lady at the gate was rudely telling a very pregnant women with two little children that their small stuffed animal bag was too big. The lady said that the check in counter told her she was fine. The woman was in tears. It wasn't as much as she had to pay more as she was being treated awful. While she was crying she told another lady with a child that her bag was too big too. That lady also was told at check in hers was fine. She was told that the plane could leave without her. My husband while waiting for me offered to pay for the lady's bag so she could get on the plane. Your employee was rude and disrespectful to these women. I was a nervous wreck just being there and worse after all of this occurred. This employee needs some training classes on how to work with the public and be more compassionate. I fly twice a month with Alligent and everyone is very friendly. This is the first flight that I have experienced that was unfriendly to so many.",1

A horrible experience from the beginning. Myself and my party of four boarded the plane and after a half an hour we were told the brake pressure was not where it was supposed to be. Everyone was asked to leave the plane and hour by hour we received texts saying our flight was delayed. Finally, from 12 to 5 p.m. an announcer said they were going to cancel the flight. We were given 8 dollars for food that the Rochester airline would accept and the airline refuses to refund our flight or extend it one more. I just graduated college, my traveling time is very limited. I wasted a whole day in the airport and a day of vacation because of mechanical issues that I personally think should have been checked before everyone boarded the plane. I called the customer care line twice and both ladies were rude and not helpful.  Horrible experience.",-1

2016-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,TUL to MCO,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,unprofessional and unreliable,False," Unprofessional and unreliable. Will not fly this airline again. We have flown Allegiant Airlines several times, but twice in the last month both flights were delayed and then cancelled until the next day with no explanation - weather was not an issue. Many others in line with us after the cancellation said they had several flights with Allegiant cancelled and had to stay overnight as well. Both times the flight was cancelled we stood in line for over an hour to receive a $100 voucher for a future flight. Allegiant has no extra planes to send in so you just have to stay overnight and since our flight was supposed to be at 7.15 am that means hanging out at the hotel all day unless you want to pay to rent a car. Allegiant counter staff were fairly rude and matter of fact - the man behind us had a wife graduating from college that night and was going to have to miss it. Transportation to the airport was disorganized and you had to have a receipt and send it in to get reimbursed. I don't ever post reviews but want to warn others that the discount prices of this airline aren't worth it.",-1

I was told it was a mechanical problem then 11pm I was told the captain had exceeded his working hours. It was unbelievable. At 9pm we were offered soda. At 10pm we were offered an $8 dollar food voucher. This was ridiculous because $8 couldn't even cover the cost for sandwich, the voucher so late in the night that food in the fridge was gone. We had to get out of the terminal the only shop that was open a bagel shop and then we had to re-check in with security to come back in. The bagel shop the cashier yelled at us and refused to take the voucher until someone called an Allegiant Air personnel to talk to them. At 11:00pm they finally told use flight was cancelled they would book hotel accommodations. There are over 100 people on this flight so by the time we got our hotel accommodation we were booked the worker said they ""would call the bus"" to come pick us up from the airport to the hotel. Which took another 45 minutes to get us to the hotel by the time we got to hotel it was pass midnight. we were schulded to fly out next day at 10am. I was going to be very smart and beat the crowd and to get my tickets for this flight. I arrived at 6am. Only to find out that the ticket counter didn't open until two hours before the flight.  So how the heck were they supposed to check in about 100 passengers onto this flight most people needed tickets printed luggage checked in and be ready by 10 o'clock for take off. I was second in line and flight didn't get started for check in until 8:15am. the captain is sitting at the boarding desk. He is also highly irritated himself trying to explain to us that he was too tired that he had worked his Max hours and could not fly the night before. how the heck is that my problem - 10 am rolls around and no one to help with boarding. I had paid for seats towards the front in row 10 bc of medical issues, but as my medical issues were not life ""threatening"" they told me I had to wait until Zone 5 was called - by the time my zone was called I had to sit in the back of the plane.  On my way back we were delayed from 3pm to 7pm. At 6:45 the aircraft had not even arrived and we were supposed to fly out at 7pm.",-1

Our flight was supposed to leave at 5:02pm. About 15 minutes from the airport I received a text that we were delayed until 5:57. No big deal I thought. About an hour and a half sitting at the airport I received another alert - flight delayed until 10:10pm. The plane was having issues. I'm all about a safe plane and was fine with it. Once finally boarded at 11:00 we were asked to get off of the plane apparently because we had been drinking. After sitting in the airport for about 7 hours we had made friends with all of the other passengers waiting to board. Still have not been given a reason why they took us off the plane.

Sent a letter to customer service to verify what was said to me on the phone call concerning Nut allergies and seating children with parents. Was told by a travel representation that nut allergies are taken very seriously and children are never separated from a parent. Boarded our flight, the flight attendants that day denied alerting the passengers of my 9 year olds nut allergy. Said that have him deal with it and place him by the window.  Into the flight they began selling snacks containing Peanuts and Tree Nuts. My son became ill, administered more antihistamines and received zero assistance from the flight crew. There was a nurse onboard who came to our aide. Hindsight is 20/20 I wish I would have read the airline reviews before purchasing our seats. Please take the time to read the Allegiant customer comments on how horribly they treat their customers. They are sponsored with The Make A Wish foundation who help grant the wishes of courageous children with life threatening conditions. A complete contradiction to what was given to my son March 11th flight 845.",-1

Allegiant delayed the flight twice and left at least two passengers I'm aware of at security because no one was at the check in desk for them to get boarding passes. I barely made it on the flight despite that issue only because I had my boarding pass downloaded on the app already. No one was there to check my bag and they refused to send anyone out to the desk to help those two people, one of which came right after me. Allegiant has a reputation for being late, yet they wouldn't help passengers who were a measly 5 min late after they'd delayed the flight twice by 3 hours. They don't even offer water complimentary on their flights anymore. I've flown Allegiant several times and the stress you have to put up with, outrageous costs for carry on bags, seat selection, etc. never seems worth the money.",-1

We got within 10 miles of AVL and were told we needed to circle because the cloud cover was too heavy to land. After 45 minutes we were told we were flying back to FLL. In the ensuing 1 hr 45 minute flight back, no other announcement was made, the flight attendants claimed they had no info, and were rude and all but disappeared. Call buttons were going off all over the plane and were being ignored. We departed the plane with no information about rebooking, no representative at the gate, and no information. A baggage handler close by was caught by surprise and tried to find out something, which he finally told those who could hear him that the flight was rebooked for the next morning, there would be no room or food vouchers and everyone was on their own. He was asked to make an announcement so the 150 passengers could all hear, but he would not do that and left everyone confused. I understand things beyond an airline's control but customer service is always within an airline's control, Allegiant failed on all counts. Spend the extra $$ upfront with a reliable carrier.",-1
