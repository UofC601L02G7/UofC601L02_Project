2024-09-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,an unreliable travel partner,True,"   First time I tried United from New York to Orlando my flight got cancelled and my trip delayed by 2 days. This time my flight got delayed by 5 hrs. What gets me is the gate agents attitude, they are unhelpful and not very accommodating. United is an unreliable travel partner.",-1
2024-09-13,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Boston,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,an exceptional and thoughtful person,True,"   Air Hostess Susie is an exceptional and thoughtful person. She went above and beyond to assist me on the flight. Because of her kind hospitality, I will continue to fly with United Airlines.",1
2024-09-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Puerto Vallarta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“gate agents not willing to be helpful”,True," Initially, our flight from Portland was cancelled. When this happened there was minimal to no accommodations for the flight. The gate agents were not willing to be helpful. Furthermore, they were scheduled off and so they were just trying to hand out cards to have people call customer service and reschedule. When I called customer service they continued to transfer me to three different people resulting in being hung up on. At the counter, as the passenger, I had to contact another airline and they were able to assist even though it was not their issue. The lady that was initially helping us was more concerned about whether or not she had clocked back in. To add, the customer service line that they opened had closed in the middle of trying to arrange our new flights. The supervisor on duty told us that the line was still open, and made zero efforts to try and open that line. As the customer I had to research the phone number to talk to reservations. The guy who was trying to switch the flights was getting very frustrated and visibly angry. As a customer we felt the same emotions but we needed the support from the airline in order to make our trip happen. To sum this up, United got us a flight on delta airlines. This flight was not properly confirmed when we got to the delta agent. The delta agent then was able to switch us to the flight that we originally wanted, making our travel day 20 hours rather than 36. United took over three hours to make accommodations and this would not of happened without me as the customer contracting both United and delta. I will never be flying United again because of how terrible this experience was. If I could leave a no star I would.",-1
2024-09-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Norfolk,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,beware of this companies lack of care,True,"   On 7/15/2024 my connecting flight from NJ to VA was cancelled, rebooked for twelve hours later. Minor inconvenience so I spent the day in NYC to kill time. Upon returning to the airport for my rebooked flight, all passengers were told to debark due to mechanical issues. Still not the biggest problem, but now there is not rebooking. The gate agent was extremely volatile with multiple customers. United did not issue any hotel, rental, bus, train, or food compensation for this inconvenience. I called the customer service line and that got me nowhere. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they are not answering the call. I was trapped in the Newark airport for over a day with no help from United. I eventually booked an Amtrak train ticket to make a deadline I had at work the next day since I hadn't arrived home on the scheduled day 7/15/2024. Buyer beware of this companies lack of care for their customers time and money since the services were not completed.",-1
2024-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Appleton to Seattle,,,,,,1.0,1,continues to deny our request to reimburse us,False,"  We booked a flight with United from Appleton, WI to Seattle, WA the day before our cruise was supposed to depart from Seattle. They cancelled the first leg of our flight from Appleton to Chicago so we drove to Chicago to get on the flight from there. They then continued to delay our flight continuously until they cancelled it at 1 am. It’s was then too late for us to get on a different flight to Seattle. We missed our cruise embarkation because of them. We were able to book another flight on Alaskan airlines two days later in Juneau, Alaska to catch up with our cruise in that port. United continues to deny our request to reimburse us for that airline ticket. We tried to book something thru them but they had no flights going into Alaska. We fly United on a regular basis but we will no longer be using their airline because of this. If they had cancelled our flight earlier we would have been able to book another flight to catch our cruise. Instead they delayed us 5 times and even had us on the plane for two hours and then deplaned us and delayed us repeatedly before cancelling. The whole situation is totally ridiculous. They were 100% at fault and offered no remedy or reimbursement.",-1
2024-09-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"New York to Perth via LAX, Sydney",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“No replies and just automated messages”,False," Worst airline ever and they are probably aware of it - contacting anyone in the airline is impossible. We've tried webchat, calling and email. No replies and just automated messages. Do not expect to be treated fair if anything goes wrong. Did not even get on my flight as they delayed and cancelled and then had me flying out from somewhere else with no connection to it - they refuse to refund as they say we have used this flight ticket (that got rebooked departing wrong destination). Ground staff had no clue and gave no help.",-1
2024-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Huntsville,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,lack of respect for their customers,False,"  Boarded plane late only because of the lack of organization which I listed to as I stood by the counter. Once we boarded plane, literally sat on plane for 45 minutes, pilots said nothing over the intercom the entire time. Once they backed us out the gate, sat on runway for another 1/2 hour. Nothing for airline to blame it on, weather was great, etc. Pilots provided passengers nothing, what a lack of respect for their customers",-1
2024-08-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Portland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,truly the worst airline ever,False," United is the worst airline ever I’ll never ever fly with them again I’d rather take Spirit or walk. They canceled our flights saying due to weather but we seen 5 planes take off and someone over heard them say they are short staff but telling people it’s “weather” did not put us in a hotel, did not help with food, very careless the people that work here have no clue about anything at all. Idk how this airline is still open they need to shut it down. We’ve been waiting for another flights for 14 hrs now had to sleep at ohare airport with my kids just a terrible experience they’ll never get a penny from me again! I thought Spirit was bad but no United is truly the worst airline ever!",-1
2024-08-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the worst US based carrier,True,"   United Airlines has got to be the worst US based carrier. These people have no business running an Airline. We arrived at ORD from an overseas trip. The departure time was changed 5 times. We boarded twice and had to disembark twice because lack of crew. Instead of taking off at 8:10OM we were asked to leave the plane at 2:20AM because of crew issue. No hotel voucher were given because they rescheduled the flight for 9:30AM. According to the agent we don’t have enough time to sleep and come back. No meal vouchers. We were told it will emailed, which it was not. We were told to go to another terminal near the day flight and cots will be provided. Very few cots weee there, not enough, and the cots are provided by the city of Chicago not US. I can write a book about the miserable experience provided by this miserable and poor excuse for an airline. Their staff was incompetent, lacking knowledge and unhelpful. They lied just to get rid of us. It turned out they knew they had a staffing problem with several flights, judging by the number of folks sleeping on the floor. They delayed announcing it in order to save money. It is 3:22AM and still no email, no text message and no vouchers. Flying United is a one-way ticket to hell. I will never fly them again.",-1
2024-08-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Guam to Boston via Honolulu,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"The worst travel experience"" ",False,"   The worst travel experience of my life. United will never get another penny from me connecting through Guam first United didn’t share that we had to meet in front of a specific door and only had eight minutes to do this so me and multiple other passengers, missed the open door and got trapped in the concourse for over two hours broke my bag. This is still an issue.",-1
2024-08-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Eugene to San Francisco,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,We feel cheated and upset,True,"   United airlines changed my flight at 3am on the day of my departure. We had booked the flight for 7:30am and online it said 7:30 departure. I received a text at 3:14 am, (I was sound asleep, not expecting to get up until 5:20am) saying my flight was leaving at 6:14am. When I woke up at 5:20, I received a reminder text stating my plane was boarding at 5:37am. We rushed out the door and made it to the airport by 5:50am. I was unaware that United airlines did not require a boarding pass and so I could have went through TSA with only my ID. But because I could not find a kiosk to print my boarding pass, I went to the front counter to try to get a boarding pass. I have never flown united airlines before this so I was unaware of their new ID only policy. When I got to the front counter the lady was on both her cell phone and the landline. She did not look up at me. She did not even acknowledge. I was standing there. About 10 minutes later she asked me for my name, then told me that I was missing my flight. Another man walked up, and my brother and sister came at the same time. We told the man That my flight was supposed to leave at 7:30 not 6:14, He looked it up and saw that we were telling the truth. But he said they hadn't had a flight to san Francisco that leaves at 7:30am for 2 months. Their system never updated that information. So now if you go online and book your flight out for 7:30, it is incorrect, but you won't find out until 3am on the day of your departure by text message. It seems like a scam. We feel cheated and upset that we had to go through so much stress. The woman on the phone was very rude and did not even acknowledge us or apologize. When we ask her to apologize she responded with ""stop yelling at me"" Which none of us were yelling. Her supervisor also defended her and acted as though we were wrong. It felt like narcissistic abuse. I will never book another flight on united airlines.",-1
2024-08-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Boston,3.0,,1.0,,,3.0,2,flight attendants were very rude,False," The flight attendants on Flight #1185 on Friday, August 23, 2024, were very rude. I believe the management should review the staff working on this flight, address their attitude, and ensure they receive proper training on how to treat clients with respect.",-1
2024-08-24,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Myrtle Beach to Newark,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,yelled at very rudely,True," Firstly, nothing against the pilot or traffic built up. We arrived in New Jersey at around 8:10pm and did not exit the plane until 8:50pm due to arriving earlier than scheduled, traffic, and the gate was changed. The upsetting part is that there are children, elderly, people with health issues, and pregnant women on board. We were told to stay in our seats but those who got up to use the washroom were yelled at very rudely by the air flight attendant. When some of us went to the washroom she yelled out “make it quick!”, making people look around and then she proceeded to use the microphone to yell out “the aircraft won’t move unless everyone is seated” but children and mothers and elderly still got up during the wait. The airplane was not in motion during the whole time it was landed. This flight attendant also made us feel unwelcome during the flight. She would stare and look us people up and down without any greetings or smile as the flight attendants normally do. It was a terrible flight simply for the way she treated us and made people feel ashamed for having to use the washroom during such a lengthy wait to the gate. A young person who flew for their first time even mentioned “there is a way to speak to people, but that is not the way she should have explained the situation, she could have kindly reminded everyone to remain seated”. I feel bad for this new flyer since this is her first impression of flight attendants. I can’t imagine talking to anyone to “make it quick!”",-1
2024-08-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Junction to Corpus Christi,2.0,,2.0,,,3.0,1,"stressful, expensive, and plain frustrating",True,"   I am a disabled woman that suffers from chronic pain. I very rarely travel because it is often difficult and painful, but my mom is sick so me and my son are tying to fly down to see her. Our flight was delayed for 6 hrs yesterday, then canceled and rescheduled for 6am. We arrived at 5am as requested, only to be delayed another 4 hours by 530. Now as I sit here head pounding, fighting tears and trying to ignore the spreading pain, I am listening to announcements offering $500 travel vouchers for anyone willing to take later flight than the one currently boarding. Really? I don't understand, or appreciate being forced to wait hour after hour, day after day for a single fight that keeps getting pushed off while they are happily paying people to wait while their planes leave on time. Further more while the staff I have had contact with have been super kind, it is obvious to me that this airline could care less how inconvenient their overpriced flights are or how stressful, expensive, and plain frustrating these delays are to their customers. For goodness sake, you have to pay extra to bring a carry-on, to check even 1 bag, to have any space on the plane, or even to be able to sit next to your child, yet they leave you stranded in the terminal where water cost $5 bucks for hours, and now days in a row! I for one will NEVER make the mistake of flying United Airlines again.",-1
2024-08-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Newark,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,The most horrible airline,False,"  The most horrible airline I ever got across in my entire travel experience. I had a flight with UA from West Palm Beach - Newark - Fra. Well the first flight was totally a hell, the flight from PBI- Newark was delayed for 5 hours! I ended up arriving at Newark after 5 hours! After the original time, I was supposed to take a flight to Germany FRA and because they were super delayed I missed the flight to Germany, I arrived at New Jersey around 11:45 pm at that time there was no more available flights to Germany, well I had to wait until next day to get another flight to Germany, I went to the UA airport counter, the employees were so rude, they said they couldn’t give me another flight because the flight was operated by Lufthansa, I went to Lufthansa and they told me that United Airlines had to do it, I went back to UA counter and one of the employees told me she cannot help me and told me to call the customer service phone line. Let me tell you their customer service is the most ugliest and horrible customer service I ever experienced in my whole life. To begin with this endless nightmare, they kept me on hold for 3 hours on the phone , 3 hours! I even screenshot the reordered phone calls with these idiots!! At the end of the phone call the customer service agent told me that she refuses to give me a hotel voucher. Yeah alright after their flight being delayed for 5 hours. I arrived so late at Newark airport. The second thing that made me explode was that after 3 hour phone call the agent told me to go back to the UA airport counter and ask for the alternative flight for my missed flight, at this point my blood was boiling! She said she couldn’t help me and that I had to go to the counter again. I spent the whole night at Newark airport walking around, sitting around because this airport is so dangerous, lots of homeless people walking around trying to do something bad to others. Then the next morning again I went to the UA counter, again they refused to help me again. They told me to go to Lufthansa because the flight was operated by Lufthansa.  At this point I was crying because no airline wanted to help me, I felt so helpless, then I went and looked for a manager of the UA, he said that he was gonna take a look to my reservation, again he told me to go to Lufthansa , I told him that I been bounced like 7 times already back and forth between those 2 airlines, he came with me to Lufthansa counter and spoke to the Lufthansa staff, they looked at my ticket number and said that the ticket number did not exist. Then the UA manager told me to give him 2 hours to figure this out, after 2 hours I came to the UA counter and he said to me that he is sorry that him and his staff crew didn’t type the numbers of the ticket or reservation code correctly on their computers.  They have complete fools working at this airlines, these people gave me a hell because they are so incompetent and stupid to even know what they are doing? And on top of everything their staff was so rude. Finally after 16 hours I got my flight to Germany. The nightmare doesn’t end here. My returning flights from this horrible airline were messed up and disorganized, I must said this airline is extremely unreliable. I had to run like in a marathon throughout the airport of Holland to not miss my flight to America. Their damn flight was again delayed for 2 hour.  Never again UA.",-1
2024-08-22,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to San Francisco,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,3,seat width were completely acceptable,False,"  United is not a good airline, but it's not a bad one either. The main meals are better left alone, but throughout the flight they did serve snacks that were pretty good. Given my average size and height, the legroom and seat width were completely acceptable (tip: you gain a LOT of feet space by stowing carry-ons in the overhead bins rather than under the seat in front of you). That said, the recline was awful. Compared to other overseas carriers like Air France or Lufthansa, they barely recline at ALL.",1
2024-08-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honalulu to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,“could not have been more disappointed”,False," Switched from Delta for this flight to see the differences between it and united. Had heard decent things before, and wow....I could not have been more disappointed. To start with, they have a ""phone stand"" attached to the seat for your ""own personal entertainment station"". A set up as low quality as a dollar store phone stand. And the in-flight food both to AND from our destination was FROZEN. The chicken was absolutely disgusting (And frozen), and when I asked the flight attendant if she could possibly heat the chicken, she just repepated no over and over with a deer in headlights smile, (will post her name later) till I finally got fed up with her absolute lack of care and told her to take the lunchable style brown bag excuse they'd tried to paddle off as food. The seats are a huge downgrade from other flights on the same aircraft, and when I wasn't being nickel and dimed for everything from bags to drinks the pilot was upselling items. This seriously feels like the dollar store knockoff of a real flight. What an absolute embarrassment.",-1
2024-08-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Portland,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,they don’t care about you,False,"  Worst experience of our life, they don’t care about you at all. They canceled our flight and didn’t offer any new flight, no meals, no transportation, no hotel rooms nothing. They won’t even refund our money for the original flight. Then when you ask for help they tell you to go the website and fill out a form. My sister in law had this exact thing happen two months ago no call back no email no refund.  Do not waste your time or money. I would have rather walked.",-1
2024-08-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to newark,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,it turned into a nightmare,False,"  My flight from Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to Newark was supposed to depart at 13:52, with a connecting flight to Dubai. Instead, it turned into a nightmare. The flight was delayed six times due to weather conditions, which is understandable, but the way United handled it was terrible. After each delay, we were asked to line up and prepare for boarding, only to be told to wait more. Eventually, after hours of waiting and false hope, they canceled the flight. If they had just canceled it earlier, my mother and I wouldn't have wasted our entire day at the airport. To make matters worse, when the cancellation was announced, we were told to stand in two lines—one for international travelers. My mother and I stood in line for 2 hours, only to be cut off by someone who had already been served but didn’t like the hotel they were given. Despite Assistant Maria already talking to me, she decided to help this person instead. Then, another assistant, Nina, ignored me and left while I was still waiting. When we went ""upstairs"" to United's main kiosk to get new reservations, it was another disaster. Unlike everyone else who was in line ""downstairs,"" I was told I couldn't be reimbursed, with the excuse that the system wouldn’t allow it. This left me to cover additional costs for transportation, accommodation, and food—all over my budget. To top it off, when I reached out to United’s customer service about this, I received a lazy, dismissive response: ""Unfortunately, I'm unable to reimburse your costs as the flight interruption was outside of our control."" This reply was both upsetting and offensive. It feels incredibly unfair and ridiculous that I was left standing out, almost like I was being discriminated against. My mother went through all of this with me, standing and waiting without any proper support from United. Now, after saying my goodbyes, I have to spend more money just to get home. I’m extremely disappointed with how United Airlines handled this situation. I want to be reimbursed, but even more than that, I want to be heard. United Airlines, you've lost a customer for good—I’m switching to Delta.",-1
2024-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Washington via San Francisco,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2,really seem to hate their job,False,"  The flight attendants really seem to hate their job and hate being there. They can’t time the trash pick up properly. They distributed snack and drinks, followed immediately by a meal. So when they came around with the drink cart and asked if we wanted a drink, I wanted to say I can’t because my tray is full. Then at snack time, they came with the trash cart 10 mins after we got our food. And it’s been another 10+ minutes and they haven’t made their rounds yet. Food is really bad too.",-1
2024-08-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Appleton to San Francisco,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,9 delays involving 4 planes,True," Booked a flight from Appleton - 3 hr delay prior to arriving was able to change flights easily (impressed at the ease at the time - now I know why clearly rebooking if a continuious activity if flying United) had a delay with the new flight. Got to Denver (layover) another delay 1/2 hr, 2nd delay another 1/2 hr, start boarding, de board -flat tire -then 2 flat tires. Landed 9:45 pm in San Francisco vs 7:15 days gone - so much for paying for flight with good landing times. Return flight San Francisco to Appleton - loaded late then a 1/2 hr delay, while in plane another delay of 1 and a half hours. Scheduled flight 12:55pm new fly time was 2:55! Denver was layover had weather while flying - airport was a mess BUT most flights were back to being on time - not United. My flight was delayed for 6 hrs 8:45 pm leaving vs landing in Appleton at 9:15pm - landing time changed to 12:15 am. Was able to change flights and land at Madison at 11pm. To conclude -9 delays involving 4 planes totals for 1 trip. Fun fact : 3 different airports never did go to the airport that I booked out of. Way to go United - take the $$ the leave it to the customers to do your job and juggle numerous flights to complete their trip!! Will say their staff was nice but assuming they have to be since the actual purpose of United is to fly people and they fail at that!",-1
2024-08-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Newark,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,Absolutely disgraceful,False," United is the worst airline out there. Every single flight I’ve had over the last 10 years has been delayed, cancelled or rerouted. All this while getting less room, no meals, barely any snacks and higher prices. I love waking up at 5:30am for a flight they’ve delayed for 6.5 hours and then getting kicked off the tarmac because they forgot a food cart causing the flight to be flat out cancelled. Absolutely disgraceful that they’re allowed to run a company like this.",-1

2024-08-09,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Hong Kong,,,,,,,4,Thank you United,False,"  This review is not for flying but for customer service. Our family experienced with one of our cousins a terrible accident. When we called United and expressed concern regarding our family member traveling with mental and physical health issues, United with little questions after initial disclosure refunded the flight cost to our family credit card. The agent on August 9, 2024  was polite, sensitive, and efficient. There was no playing games with needing to go to a supervisor. And since our family member who called was and is experiencing PTS because of observing the accident, this aware service agent eased our family pain. Thank you United. We will use the refund to have another family member fly soon. You have our business because of this sensitivity of your agent.",1

2024-08-08,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kalispell to Little Rock,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,"Worst experience flying"" ",True,"   Worst experience flying. The outgoing flight from Little Rock to Denver was delayed by an hour 4 hrs before the departure time. Ended up being 2hrs late. Because of this we missed our flight out of Denver causing us (me and 2 small children) to book the next flight which was 12 hours later. Meaning I could either sleep in the airport with small kids or pick from the very limited hotels. The hotel they booked is had bugs in the lobby, but was fine otherwise. The flight on the way home was fine except they put my checked bags on a different plane, so we drove the hour home with no bags. They were supposed to be delivered today, 7/7/24, but they haven't moved since 1pm according to the app and I cannot get ahold of anyone via phone. Flight attendants were the highlight on all flights. All very nice.",-1
2024-08-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They were not at all helpful,True, They are the worst airline to fly with. Their customer service is rude and condescending. The flight was cancelled because of a mechanic issue which led to waiting until the bad weather came in. If they were not delayed by the 2 hours for mechanical issues we would have made it to the destination before thunderstorm started. They are unable to rebook people for 2-3 days because they overbook the flights. There was no compensation for food or hotels. They would not allow anyone to have their luggage even though some people completely cancelled their plans because of the long delay. They were not at all helpful. There is not 1 good thing I can say about them.,-1
2024-08-07,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Albuquerque,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5,went above and beyond for me,True,"   United Airlines flight was perfect.

What a wonderful bunch of stewards and stewardesses were on that flight! They went above and beyond for me!",1
2024-08-07,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Newark,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5,United Airlines employees put extra effort,False," I was on a family vacation with my two adult children from New Jersey. Our vacation was over and we were flying back home on Saturday, August 3, 2024. Unfortunately, our flight home to Newark Liberty Airport from New Orleans was cancelled about two hours prior to scheduled departure. United Airlines employees put extra effort in to making a nightmare experience into a tolerable one. First, on Saturday afternoon, they helped us out through the entire process of rebooking our flight for 6 am the next day, taking care of hotel accomodations, airport transfers, meal vouchers, and reassuring us throughout the process that we will be well taken care of. They guided us on how to get our checked luggage back and what we needed to do the next day. On early Sunday morning around 3:30 AM, another United Airlines employee, helped my two children to get their bags retagged, as the kiosk would not print out updated luggage tags. They also helped all three of us to get Gate passes we needed, since our boarding pass said delayed flight and we were already checked in yesterday. She also rebooked my children's tickets to make sure that sat next to each other. This was something we did not even ask her to do. Thanks to both.",1
2024-08-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh-Durham to Houston,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1,Extremely disappointed,False,"  We were flying to Houston to connect with a Air New Zealand international flight to Auckland, then onward to Adelaide, Australia. Arrived at checkin with 3 hrs to spare at Raleigh-Durham. Our agent gave us etickets. Tried to checkin on line but got message ""proceed to checkin counter"". The lady at the counter could not find us on the passenger list for quite some time. Finally she says. OH you just have etickets. Yes, that's what we showed her. She said the flight is fully booked, I don't have room. I said we are connecting with an international flight and United is the carrier. She looked some more and found seats, apart, but at least we were on board. Come boarding time, we get are in group 3 and get told no more room for carry on. We explained to staff we had a stop over in New Zealand and needed what we had. Our cabin bag weighed less than 5kg each. She suggested we condense into 1 bag not over 7kg. Thankful for her suggestion we did that. One cabin bag was then checked through all the way to Australia. Go to step onboard the aircraft to have a flight attendant step forward and scream at top of her voice to us .. I have no more room, get off, go back and check the bag in. We explained what had just transpired during boarding and proceeded to find out seats. She gets on the PA and screams down the isle .. no more room for baggage, means no more room. Other passengers said to us how rude they found her too. When my husband reached his seat, he was holding the cabin bag while checking the nearby overhead lockers. Again she gets on PA and screams .. Sir, you can not stand there holding you bag. He wasn't holding anyone up in the isle at all. A male attendant came along and said .. come with me Sir, there is room down the back of the plane. My husband said there were 2 empty overhead bins still. While all this was going on I was watching other passengers get on with 2 pieces of cabin luggage each. The female Head Attendant was rude and abrupt during the flight to others, which thankfully was a short flight. We have travelled extensively and never been spoken to in such a rude demeaning manner. United Airlines should enfirce the rule 1 carryon piece each passenger so there is room for everyone's luggage. We will never travel with United Airlines again, which unfortunately means we won't travel to visit family in USA on Air New Zealand with United being their carrier. Obviously United Airlines is quite affluent because it does not need repeat customers. Extremely disappointed in that staff member and the lack of luggage space onboard for a passenger transiting to an international flight when we arrived 3 hours before departure time.",-1
2024-08-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,1,I had the worst time,True, I had the worst time flying United on 8/3/2024 from Orlando to Newark! We had a direct flight to Newark. They cancelled that flight and booked us on a connecting flight. We were ok with that. But then while boarding and waiting an hour on the plane in Orlando we noticed they had cancelled our connecting flight to Newark and they did not rebook us. Then as we were trying to get information they gave us a card and basically said fend for yourself! We had to take a 40 minute Uber from IAD Dulles international airport to Newark Penn Station and then take an UBER home from there!,-1
2024-08-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Vancouver via Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst experience with an airline,True,"   I had a flight from Cancun to Vancouver. Airplane legroom was quite tight and was not comfortable, Flight attendant were not responsible, nor polite and didn't care for any request. It was my first flight with United Airlines and it'll be my last one with them. I wont recommend this airline to anybody else. Flight had more than 4 hours delay, that was announced each half an hour, so no body could even have an idea when can ask their family to pick them up at YVR. Ultimately, after provide a $ 15 dinner voucher, too late to use, so we paid almost $ 80 to buy a brief dinner together with my wife and I didn't apply the voucher at all. I don't have any idea how they dared to provide $15 dinner voucher after this more than 4 hours delay. Ultimately our landing was changed from 10.30 PM to 2.30 AM, that ruined our day after, too, since we reached home in Port Moody around 4.30 AM. I regret to choose United Airline and for sure it'll be the last time to choose United Airlines. Worst experience with an airline.",-1
2024-08-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tampa to Athens via Frankfurt,4.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Complete failure,True,   Complete failure. Bad weather expected so we moved the flight up to a 9 AM flight. That was canceled. No reason for us back to our original flight without having business class. Delayed because of rest. Got to Washington and missed flight by four minutes. They didn’t wait for us. We were told that they needed four empty seats. got put on a flight several hours later to Frankfurt. That flight was late and they waited for people for this flight. Now don’t know if we’ll even make our next flight. Going to miss at least one or more of our days in Athens. Tickets that were bought cannot be refunded. Fail every way.,-1
2024-08-04,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Chicago to San Diego,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,“Flight canceled at the last minute”,False, Flight was canceled at the last minute with vague reason given. This caused a major disruption to an extended family vacation involving delay and cancellation for several family groups. There were no other flights available the same day and United sent a rescheduled flight that was to a different destination on a different day. This was ridiculous and unacceptable. I cannot describe how poorly and nonchalantly we were treated. I will never fly United again.,-1
2024-08-03,0.6,Business,Economy Class,"Lisbon to Newark, NJ",3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,4,“Customer service sorely lacking”,True," Flight was delayed 2 hours and then we were put into holding pattern for 3 hours in the sky. We got rerouted to another airport because running out of fuel and once landed there, sat on tarmac for another few hours. This was all due to thunderstorms around the destination. This is all well and good as nature happens, but when I tried to contact customer service to get on another flight, I never got a response back and I waited on the phone for 41 minutes on hold. Customer service sorely lacking.",-1
2024-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Houston via Richmond,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,“I got rude and snappy remarks”,False, Why do we need to open up an account with United to file a complaint with the airline? Why aren't staff trained on hidden disabilities (such as ASD)? Why are children not seated with parents on flights.. is that a policy or just randomly seat people wherever? These questions I would like to get an answer for. I don't want to get into all the details but typically a child with a disability is seated next to a parent. Why they would seat them separate is bizarre to me. I got lots of attitude when I had asked them nicely about the seating. I got rude and snappy remarks and they just escalated the situation further while I remained calm the whole time. United is by far the worst airline I have traveled on and worst experience in my entire travelling history.,-1
2024-08-02,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Zurich,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,“the human touch makes all the difference”,False," We booked our tickets the day we were traveling. We boarded Flight UA52 from Washington DC to Zurich, on July 18th at 8 pm instead of 6 pm. Our flight was delayed due to some parts that needed to be replaced by two hours. Our connecting flight from Zurich to Mumbai had a window of two hours. The United Airline personnel reassured us we will not miss our connecting flight as the pilot will make up time and the connecting flight was at the same terminal as our landing terminal. Once we boarded, I spoke to the crew who was servicing us of our situation. We were flying to my brother's funeral and his son, who was traveling with me, needed to make the connection as he had to do the last rites. The pilot made up one and half hours. We had only 30 minutes in hand. The crew were so helpful and understanding. They moved us to business class for the last 10 minutes before landing so we were the first ones to deboard. I cannot thank the crew enough for their support and for making this happen. We made our connecting flight with 10 minutes to spare. And we made it to Mumbai. Thank you to the crew of Flight UA52. I wish I remembered your names. It is the human touch that makes all the difference.",1
2024-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Saint Louis to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“United Airlines didn't care”,False," I purchased two tickets to LAX. Unfortunately my mother passed and I had to cancel my trip. United Airlines didn't care, wouldn't refund anything except my seat fare and they even upgraded my ticket without asking and charged me more money for the upgrade. I just can't believe that I have the death certificate and everything to give them and I can't get my money for the ticket refunded they gave me a voucher that's only good for a year and I'm not a frequent flyer and will never use the voucher because I'll never fly with United again.",-1
2024-08-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Sarasota,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,disgusted with the service of United,False,"   I have been flying United for years but recently I have been less than impressed. On my recent flight to Newark NJ I experienced a 1 plus hour delay in addition to a freezing cabin temperature. Then on our flight home we were again delayed 1 hour due to no pilot available! I mean really. The flight prior to ours was delayed coming in and I honestly believe the “missing pilot “ excuse was just a cover for their inability to get their flights on time. So in addition after waiting the extra hour and paying extra to have priority boarding, I was told I had to check my carry on at the gate due to they had reached the maximum amount of luggage. Yet when I boarded the plane I found numerous over head bins completely empty. So I get seated in my seat and watch as the passengers board the plane only to notice that after awhile people were entering the plane and able to use the overhead bins. I'm utterly disgusted with the service of United and after years of flying I am over their sub par services and over charges. Delta is going to be my choice from now on.",-1
2024-08-01,0.4,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Koror to Manila,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2,not worth half the fare paid,True,"   This was a really bizarre flight, like being thrust 20 years into the past. Despite the app telling us Wifi was available on the flight, it does not appear to be offered on this class of plane in the fleet (specifically the 737s used in the Pacific). United routes in Micronesia use planes that have not been updated since the routes were flown by Continental Micronesia, and the cabin is showing its age. Seats barely holding together, no power outlets, no real entertainment selections since the entertainment system is just a screen and buttons to change channels to see continuously-looped content. If you want to know what it was like to fly United in 2002, this is a good way to experience it, but ultimately the inflight experience was not worth half the fare paid.",-1
2024-07-31,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Honolulu via Houston,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,“Deceiving practice”,False, United Airlines does not support the US military traveler. They advertise free checked bags and carry on for active duty military. But this is dependent on the type of ticket purchased. If you must purchase an expensive ticket to get the bags this is not offering a service for US military. Deceiving practice.,-1
2024-07-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Madrid,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the last time I fly United Airlines,False,"   Horrible experience from A to Z. Purchasing the ticket was a nightmare. I had to change my flight and I payed a penalty (which is ok) But the agent 1 told me I would have a credit to purchase my next ticket. Agent 2 said I would have a refund on my credit card but 3 weeks later the refund wasn’t done. I had to talk with a manager to have that corrected (after hours on the phone) Arrived to destination my luggage got lost. No help to cover was offered at all. I had to purchase shoes, shorts and more. To be compensated it really seems to be a nightmare. One week later the luggage was found and sent but all the content was wet. They sent my luggage to my first destination but too late as I had to leave to the next city for work. On the FOUR flights I had separated seats from my wife and the boarding was so messy that nobody wanted to change seats. This is the last time I fly United Airlines.",-1

2024-07-30,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Salt Lake to Dallas via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,service United delivers is dehumanized,False,"   Our flight to SFO had been delayed due to a mechanical problem. We had to sit 5 hours in the plane! All Americans in the plane just acted like it's all good and just another day. I missed my connection to Dallas because of this. Getting a new flight, apparently goes through their app only. Nobody in person that you can help at a desk. Even though there was a direct flight available (from United) the app did not give the possibility to rebook this flight. Instead they offered an indirect flight through Houston. The only way to contact them is by phone. Nobody really helping you to get as soon as possible to your destination. I can't believe Americans take this kind of low service level. In a 'consumer oriented' society like the US I expected people to be more assertive. The service United delivers is dehumanized. In total it took me 14 hours to get to Dallas! I think it's totally unacceptable. Even though a mechanical failure can happen, getting you another flight to get you asap to your destination is a minimum in such a situation. After this experience I think I will never fly United again.",-1
2024-07-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to San Jose,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,disgusted with how things were handled,False,"   I will never fly them again. I was supposed to arrive to my destination but due to the global outage my partner and I could not make it in the time we were supposed to (not our fault. Once we were redirected they had transfered our luggage to another state and we did not even board that flight. Not sure how it was flown over to the state when the flight was cancelled. Not only did we not get our luggage for 3 days, once we did land to our destination, the zipper on my luggage had been broken off. When we did arrive to the destination we were told to leave our keys so they can check for anything during customs and then once we got the luggage they would be returned to us. My luggage was complete destroyed. I am on vacation I paid for my time and I decided to call them once I got back with that broken luggage and now I am being told it was over 7 days they cant do anything about it. I find that extremely messed up. Not only did I miss my time to decompress due to the global outage, it is what it is, but, I also had no luggage for 3 days when we arrived and had to buy clothes. I decided to take it easy and call once I got back and on Friday late night, I decided to call Monday (working days) just to be told cant do anything about it. So not only did I miss a couple of days of no luggage bought clothes out of pocket, then to have a damage luggage to bring back and to now be told oh wells sorry cant do anything about it. That's absolutely disgusting. People spend thousands of dollars to travel and save up for that and then some. To be treated like it's nothing is so rude. I will never travel United again, it was not only the most dirtiest flight but the staff was extremely unwelcoming. Customer care was not helpful at all. I've never had to call an airline more than 2 times, I think I have called United at least 8 times in the matter of a week just to connect with someone. I suggest you guys do better with how you show empathy. It's all a money grab for you guys. Absolutely disgusted with how things were handled.",-1

I am upset because I am a memeber and have 18K worth miles plus $2K of flight money or i guess cash due to me, and all I wanted was to use my miles the same way i do on the plane and get snacks, but this time for my daughter who is visiting from college, and I bought her ticket through my account. But they refuse do do that. You are the only one who can use it. They owe me money after getting off a flight so others could travel because plane was to heavy, and I was first to say yes.

I bought a ticket with hand luggage. But they refused to put me on the plane until I paid for my hand luggage as baggage. Why did they create the measuring box? If it doesn't make sense. I showed a screenshot from their corporate website, where the dimensions of hand luggage were indicated. But the company employees didn’t care about the site.",-1
2024-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ontario to Houston,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,We had a terrible experience,False,"   We had a terrible experience with United Airlines. Our flight was scheduled for 5:45 am, and we arrived at the airport on time. However, the check-in process was unusually slow, taking much longer than expected. After finally getting through check-in, we proceeded to security, but we were stopped by the employee who checked us in. They realized there was an issue with my boarding pass and spent another 15 minutes verifying it. Once we reached security, we encountered another problem: the TSA agent noticed a discrepancy between my boarding pass and passport. This required us to go back to the check-in counter, where it took them another 10 minutes to identify that my birthdate was entered incorrectly. By the time everything was sorted out and we returned to the security checkpoint, there was a lengthy queue. Despite rushing through security, we arrived at the gate just 5 minutes late, only to be informed that we had missed our boarding window. The airline staff instructed us to reschedule our flight due to the delay caused by these issues. Which where all caused by United Airlines.",-1

We had a connection in New York. They let first people to take three bags and they told us we have to check in our carry ons. They were absolutely rude and not professional.

As usual my United flight was overbooked and was delayed so bad (due to technical issues and needing a new plane, that a Delta flight with a Layover would have been better. This seems to happen every time I give an airline other than Delta a try. I have said I’ll never use United again more than once. Maybe they will eventually get one right.",-1
2024-07-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Corpus Christi via Houston,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,never fly with them again,True,"  I first flew United from Indianapolis to Boston via New Jersey, and my flight was delayed by two hours causing me to miss my connection. The worst part was, we were on the tarmac when they told us the flight had been delayed. And the flight on this review is my second ever flight with United trying to get from Boston to Corpus with a connection in Houston. Once again, they waited until the very last second to inform me of a 1hr and 5 minute delay (as of the time of writing this review). With their track record, I’m not that optimistic they will successfully take off at the new time, either. The gate changed twice, and they didn’t inform me of the delayed time until boarding was supposed to have ended. The flight was supposed to leave at 12:15pm, and the flight time wasn’t changed until 12:00pm. According to their information, it was a scheduling error, and I’ve honestly had such a horrible experience with getting anywhere on time with them, I will be doing my absolute best to never fly with them again.",-1

The inflight entertainment was broken, for a 13 hour flight. A mobility aid was lost on arrival, due to incorrect tagging by the staff in San Francisco - a surly check-in member who did not smile once. They broke a suitcase on top of all that, which they refuse to fix. Avoid this disaster of an airline. They do not care about passengers.",-1

The company assured me that the entire reservation was canceled and provided a cancellation email. After realizing no refund was received I dispute my credit card which United fought back stating it as a valid charge. I called to speak to United in May. I found out that they only canceled 1 person off and currently 3 people are still active on their end. After understanding the error that occurred the agent said to go on their dispute site and submit refund and documents, which were submitted on 5/27, Jun 3, and Jul 17 with no answer. Today I spoke with the agent to understand the issue, only to find out that they are refusing the refund. I spoke with the refund department and she said “sorry, unfortunately there is nothing that can be done for this reservation. I asked her, how did my daughter disappear off the reservation? And if her cancellation was valid why did United never refunded the charge for her and kept the full amount and applied to the remaining 3 tickets? I told her the entire reservation was canceled and for some reason 1 person got canceled so please issue a refund as this is large amount and in today's economy every dollar is important. The initial reservation was for 4 people in excess of $4000+.",-1
2024-07-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Grand Rapids,3.0,3.0,5.0,,2.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have ever flown,False,"   This is the worst airline I have ever flown. I usually travel via spirit due to it being inexpensive and like to save money to have a little better of stay where ever I am going. Unfortunately to fly to Grand Rapids you can not fly spirit so we chose united thinking well it cannot be worse (we were wrong). I don't expect luxury when I fly I expect to make it to my destination and if it is weather delayed that is okay but when 3 planes aren't working that's a huge issue. My girlfriend and I were stuck in Denver forever away from home (Indiana) for almost 9 hours and we knew we would be there for at least an hour cause Denver was a connecting flight so i couldn't imagine what getting there early would have been. Our flight was after 7 hours cancelled and we were there another 2 hours trying to get things figured out. By the time we made it to our hotel it was 5am our home time. We were told by someone at the Denver airport he has been there ""30 years"" we could get a flight two days later from our original flight date. So we had to get a rental to get to our destination and has been the most insane time trying to get our rental reimbursed. Everyone on customer support speaks minimal English and can't help us well. The airport workers are no help they all just pass out cards with a QR card and I had to use a phone to translate information to a Chinese speaker. This is unacceptable from an airline who claims to be one of the better airlines.",-1

There was ample leg room in Economy Plus. Departure was on time. The flight overall was smooth except for bumpy patches which the pilot advised the passengers of before takeoff.

2024-07-12,0.5,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Washington to London,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,1,more than a little disappointed,True,"  This review concerns UA 918 from IAD on 11 July 2024 to LHR. The aircraft departed IAD with a closed lavatory near seat 9A in the fully occupied Polaris section of the cabin. This left one lavatory available near seat 9B and one near the cockpit. By mid-flight several passengers lined up to use the lavatory near 9B resulting in a very crowded situation. I decided to try to use the lavatory near the cockpit. As I approached the latter, I was stopped by a flight attendant and informed that it was unavailable because a pilot was about to use it. The FA told me to use the other lavatory in business. I explained that it was very crowded there and asked politely if I could wait in the aisle until the lavatory near the cockpit became available. At that point the FA became very hostile and angry and ordered me to leave that area of the cabin. I was stunned and appalled by his behavior. I am well aware of the security measures that have been in place since 9/11. The FA had only to tell me in a civil manner that I couldn’t wait in the aisle, and I would have complied without a problem. But his treatment of me was completely out of line. I understand that flight attendants are under a great deal of pressure and stress. Yet what I was subjected to was completely unacceptable. As a very loyal 1K customer of United, I am more than a little disappointed.",1

When requested it to be fixed at the main counter, they referred us to get that done at the gate. When went to the gate and requested, the lady there was so obnoxious that ruined the whole experience. She just kept talking rudely stating “you had to get that done at the main desk”, “ you guys buy these non-refundable tickets and expect changes”, “why did you not call United in advance”, “rolled her eyes” etc. these all unnecessary, useless statements without giving me a chance to respond and kept talking over me. I guess they just find some these worst human beings on the planet to work of them or train them to be the worst when it comes down to the “customer services”. With this sort of attitude towards customer, the airline is doomed for failure. This was my first United flight experience and will never in my life fly or recommend United to anyone.",-1

We cancelled a ticket and received residual flight credit. Several months later before we were planning to use the credit to book another trip, United's system magically deletes the credit.

I had an extremely disappointing experience with this airline. Their customer service is terrible. They do not assist customers, provide solutions, or show any care for their passengers.

If a flight is delayed, they will not help you figure out how to reroute your connecting flight. I was returning to DEN and then on to another city. We were told the flight was delayed 1 hour then it was delayed 5 hours. I understand airlines have to do this and was not upset by the delay. But a 5 hour delay means a lot of people are going to miss connecting flights. As people began to line up at the counter to get help, the United staff announced that they are no longer able to access anything that would help us, but that there is an ""app"" that we all could use to reroute our connecting flights for ourselves. This shows United is trying to skimp and not train its people to be helpful, hoping that an automatized ""app"" can replace a real human being. It is the definition of an inhuman company. I tried the app, logging in on over 5 times. It asked if I wanted a phone call or message, I tried the options and every time it said that wait times were long, but then would log me out of the app before I could even see my options for re-routing my flight. I selected the option to have an agent call me. Then I received a text that an agent was ready to talk and I needed to return to the app. When I returned, it asked me to sign back in. Sure enough, when I signed back in, I was booted back to the last position in queue. There was no way to submit feedback, no contact number for United. United was basically telling me it did not care that I would miss my connecting flight. I spent a couple hours on this app, actually went to lunch while waiting for a callback, but never got a callback from United. So I went back to the counter and asked the United staff, the app is not working for me, how can I see my options so that I know which later connecting flight I can book? I suppose I made a big mistake, because I also took time to be kind to the United agent and told her that I understood this was stressful for her too and thanked her for her help. She said that she did have a seat on the 3:30 flight and could book me on that flight, but that I would get into Denver about 15 minutes before the connecting flight left and might miss that connection. I accepted that, because I would have to wait for a flight out of Denver either way. So I accepted the boarding pass she gave me and walked to the other terminal to wait for the 3:30 flight. Then as the flight was boarding, I looked down at the boarding pass and saw it was marked SBY, which means standby. Of course a bunch of others had been put on Standby as well, so there was no chance of getting a seat. The United staff at the other terminal was sub-professional and never made any kind of announcement of what we should do if we had a SBY ticket. People kept wandering up to the boarding line and asking if they should board, then the United boarding staff would rush over to the counter and the person at the counter would tell them they could not board. I don't understand why they could not make a single announcement for everyone, ""go back, you should not have been sent here."" I went back to the original terminal and told them I had not been told I was being put on standby, and had never even asked to be put on another flight, I just wanted to see how to get another connection. I could keep going, but the message from United is don't ever use them for a non direct flight. They will not help, you are literally on your own.",-1

I didn't slelct a seat when I purchased the ticket. When it was time to check in on line none of the available seats were economy and all I could do was select 9a and pay more money to complete the check in. I chatted with customer service and demanded a credit. They said I could full out a form for refund review. Illegal and certainly not fair!,-1
2024-07-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to Newark,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,shabbiest treatment I've ever gotten,True,"  It was just about the shabbiest treatment I've ever gotten from an airline. Flight was scheduled for 10:25am. 4 flight delays and finally they cancelled the flight at 3pm. The staff was clueless and could not give us any information. They were just there to quell the rising aggravation. They would not even announce the delays. Some of us got the info on our phones with text message but some of us didn't because the wi-fi at the Lisbon airport is spotty so we just shared the info with each other. When they finally cancelled the flight they instructed us to go to baggage claim to collect our checked bags but did not specify a carousel. I hoofed it over there, got to baggage claim, asked where my bags might show up, was told to go to the Lost and Found area to pull a ticket, wait for my number, claim my bag lost, collect it in carousel 9. Others showed up, confused, then we were told our bags would show up at carousel 11. So now I'm watching 2 carousels for my bag. After a nail-biting 20 minutes my bag shows up at carousel 11. What they could have done is have us wait at the gate for the carousel #, in the meantime pass out meal vouchers, hotel vouchers. Instead they gave us useless cards with the scan code for a website that's akin to robot customer service making you wait on hold to tell you they can't help you. I got a text for a flight the next day at 2pm. It quickly changed to 10:25am, delayed to 10:35. The next day it was delayed again to 11:35am. But finally we got on the plane. I'll give a star to the service on the flight and what was on offer there. But just the one. Never again United. Except for the travel voucher I was sent as a mea culpa for a measly $150.",-1
2024-07-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangor to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,had to switch to a different airline,False," I put a date for this review (when I last flew United), however, due to a flight that was cancelled 5 hours before departure, I had to switch to a different airline. I was set to fly out at 6:30 am and land in Newark for a connection around 11. I got the dreaded email that the flight was cancelled and it was rescheduled. They decided to rebook me for a flight at 6:30 pm, with an ELEVEN HOUR OVERNIGHT LAYOVER. With such short notice, there was no way of getting a hotel. I had to wait on hold between two airlines for over 3 hours to get this fixed. What was supposed to be a flight with one connection to Orlando has now turned into a 2 layover flight with a different airline. I’m genuinely baffled how it’s reasonable to schedule a 1-day travel to an 11 hour overnight layover with 5 hours notice? Never flying United again.",-1

I'm on a plane right now to Cleveland that was supposed to depart at 6:19 and it’s now 7:22 and still waiting. Maintenance issues. Maybe check for maintenance issues before you schedule a flight.

If United in Houston takes off only an hour late, you will be fortunate We have been sitting on the plane for an hour after being initially delayed for an hour and forty minutes.

2024-06-27,0.2,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Chicago,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,won’t be booking United Airlines again,False,"   Flight attendants were very friendly but the service was let down by 3 things all at the airports.  As an international business traveller it is unusual to not receive premium check in, security and boarding. They let the families, veterans, and members of the United frequent flyer programme board before first class Star alliance gold passengers. The Polaris lounge did not let me in despite my flight originating in Auckland. It’s unusual to fly business class or higher and not be entitled to lounge access. I had to rely on my frequent flyer status for entry into the less exclusive United club lounge which was pointless as I was hoping to access showers (only in Polaris) after a 12 hour business class flight on a Star alliance partner airline. My baggage at ORD was one of the last on the conveyor despite having clear tags identifying it as Star Alliance Priority Baggage. I wasn’t alone, other first class passengers commented to say “so much for priority baggage” While the plane was dirty, the food selection disappointing and the lack of entertainment provided on the flight, and still requiring first class passengers to pay additional for access to wifi (with no entertainment alternative) is bad. The above 3 points made me decide that beyond my return leg I won’t be booking United Airlines again, especially in higher cabin classes as the benefits really aren’t there at all.",-1
2024-06-27,0.5,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to San Francisco,2.0,,2.0,1.0,,1.0,3,“force you to check carry on at gate”,True,  Every time I fly United I get zone 5. The issue with this is that they force you to tag and checkin your carry on at the gate regardless of whether there is space on the plan. They are also very rude about this and don't listen to anything you say. They would not allow me carry it on the plane and leave it incase it was full. I have back to back meeting in SFO and cannot afford the delay of waiting for luggage. So as expected there was a lot available on the plane and I was forced to check in my carry on.,-1
2024-06-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Sydney,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,4,let down by the back-office functions,True,"  What a complicated airline this is! I just completed a trip of 5 flights within 3 weeks. I have to say that the experiences actually on board the flights, were wonderful. Some of the best flights I’ve had in 50 years of international travel; last night from SFO to SYD, especially so. I variously flew in Premium Plus, First and last night, Polaris Business. Great crews; great service, friendly, happy, with senses of humour. Even the food was very tasty! So far, so good. But the trip home from Anchorage to Sydney, was a nightmare. A tight connection in SFO, made it necessary to re-book onto the flight the following night. Counting from the time I arrived at ANC to check in for the flights to SYD, it took 25 hours just to get as far as SFO. In dealing with the phone Reservations staff, I got what I needed. I wasn’t freely offered a hotel in SFO, but when I asked nicely about it, it - along with several meal vouchers - was given. The first sector ANC/SFO was delayed 3 times, before it got cancelled entirely, with the operating crew having run out of legal duty hours. I was re-routed via Denver. The DEN/SFO flight was delayed once, and I was downgraded to Economy, having paid for First. In the Club lounge at Denver, I got myself put on a flight leaving only 30 min after the delayed flight. It still had First seats available, so I got bumped back up again. Happy days! Then my checked bag was only checked through to SFO. The lady at the desk said she’d now check it through to Sydney. Tapped away on her computer; DONE! Wonderful! But during the flight to SFO, I thought maybe I’d better Exit on arrival, and go down to the baggage carousels, just to make sure my bag wasn't there. Just as well I did, because there it was, tagged only to SFO. If I’d been trusting, I’d have arrived in Sydney, to find that my bag was still in San Francisco! So. United was both very good, and very bad. The flight crews are let down by the back-office functions. A great pity.",1

I am overheating and my heart rate is over 100. It is normally in the 50s. The reason we are being held in this inhumane way is because the catering truck has not arrived. Seriously.

2024-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Maui,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"United needs to make this right"" ",False,"   Our family of 5 had a return flight with United Airlines from Maui to Boston scheduled for August 10, 2023. On August 8th, wildfires destroyed Lahaina and the State of Hawaii asked tourists to go home. At 12:30am on August 10th, United canceled our flight and rebooked us for a flight on August 11th. Later on August 10th, United again cancelled our rescheduled flight. Now on the 3rd day at the hotel with no power, lights or internet, the area was running out of food and looting was starting at nearby markets. Standing on the beach, using one bar of cell service from neighboring Molokai, United told me that best they can do for getting my family home is August 15th. Our options were to wait until the power came back to find other airlines, or go to the airport to find a flight knowing that once we left the hotel, there would be no hotels left on the island to stay (because we weren’t allowed back into the affected zone). At the airport, we were able to find a flight on Hawaiian Airlines for the next day. The 5 of us slept in the car that night. We spent an additional $2,457.30 in order to get home. Once home, I submitted a complaint through United’s website and waited the full 8 weeks with no response. When I followed up, they claimed they emailed me to send in receipts, but (1) I never received an email and United could not re-provide such email when requested and (2) I had already provided the receipts. As requested, I resubmitted my complaint, and again had to wait the full 8 weeks. When I followed up, they ultimately said they would only provide $100 credits per person, which I specifically said would not be sufficient. I then mailed a letter directly to the CEO. I never heard back. United Airlines put my family in danger by deserting us on Maui when people needed them the most. Alaskan, Hawaiian and Southwest should be commended for sending extra planes that week. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough – and United was canceling their flights. All this time, I’ve never asked for anything more than my money back. The credits are an insult. United needs to make this right and compensate me in cash for what we had to spend because of their neglect.",-1

The flight was comfortable and enjoyable, with a clean and well-maintained aircraft, a great selection of in-flight entertainment, and complimentary snacks and drinks.

2024-06-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Roatan,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,experience the worst I’ve ever had,False,"   My experience with United Airlines was the worst I’ve ever had. First, they canceled my flight on June 3rd without offering any reimbursement. I had to pay for a hotel and rent a car out of my own pocket. Then, they made me pay for another flight because I was stranded in Houston, needing to travel from Houston to Roatan and then back to Orlando. I ended up spending a total of $7,000 on the entire trip. United is one of the worst airlines I've ever used. They even changed my family’s seats, placing my 3-year-old daughter by herself. A child that young can't sit alone! To top it off, they misplaced my wife's suitcase, which we didn’t get until the next day. What made it even more disappointing was that they could have canceled the flight while we were still in Orlando, but instead, they waited until we were in Houston, leaving us with no choice but to pay for the additional costs since we were stuck.",-1
2024-06-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Denver,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,“stay away from United Airlines”,True," Our family got the worst experience with United Airlines. We were traveling from Denver to Los Angeles, 6/15-6/19. My husband and I both have United credit cards. We were using our mileage for the tickets. My son (3 year old), my daughter (6 month old), and I were on the same reservation, round trip from DEN to LAX. My husband was on the different one. The departure date from Denver went smoothly, we had no issues or problems. We checked in and flew out. All happy! Then on June 18th, I was checking in our flight and found out that the reservation only showed me and my daughter as passengers. I couldn't pull up info for my son (3 year old boy) and my husband reservation was no where to be found. I called the United's help desk to figure out what happened. On the phone with them for at least 1 hour and got transferred twice, the agent told me that United's Denver canceled their reservations without any communication. He told me that United said there was no show that my husand and our son did not take the plane. WE ALL TOOK THE FLIGHT. I kept telling them that over and over again. They seemed to not get it. They were basically blaming us. How the heck did we know if there was no communication, NOTHING. There were back and forth and the agent told me that he could reissue the ticket for my husband but not our son because they need to see him physically. Told me that don't worry, people at the check in counter can reissue the ticket for my son when they pulled up the reservation with all the notes that he made. Just need to go to the airport tomorrow and everything will be fine. We went to airport 3 hours before our departure time. Waited in line at checked in counter. And, was told that SHE CAN'T HELP US. We had to call the mileage plus to sort it out. Called the mileage plus and had to explain to them again that IT'S UNITED AIRLINES FAULT NOT OURS, but they kept repeating that my son did not take the flight. HE DID. HE WAS WITH US THE WHOLE TIME. There was no announcement, no communication, nothing to let's us be aware of the situation. United has our phone numbers, our email addresses. NOTHING FROM THEM. It took again more than an hour on the phone to get ticket for my son. We were able to make the flight because the gate was next to the security check-in. For the whole experience, United was blaming us and kept saying that my son was A NO SHOW. There was NO APOLOGY, NO SYMPATHY for our situation coming from them. I do blame myself to book our flights with United. Can't wait to cancel our credit cards and never have to flight with them again. If you fly with United, do check your reservation often. You won't know when they decide to cancel your reservation and not letting you know. I called the United to complain and they seem to not care if they are losing us as customers. If you can, stay away from United Airlines. If you can't, goodluck!",-1

While on the flight I was able to book a new flight out of Houston leaving the following morning, giving us a 12hr overnight layover in Houston. My immediate concerns were our luggage, which we would need because were staying overnight, lodging accommodations, and if United would help us with that. I used their app and talked to an agent online who said to talk with an employee at the airport after landing to coordinate lodging. I'll summarize the rest to the best of my ability, every employee I talked to was rude, disrespectful, and either refused or was reluctant to help, and always just handed out cards with a QR code. United didn't help with accommodations because the delay wasn't aircraft mechanical related and wasn't there fault so I paid out of pocket and had to use another day of PTO for work. Also they couldn't find our bags and those showed up at our house after a couple days. By far this was the worst customer service experience I have ever had and will avoid United unless there are literally no other options, I will pay more money happily.",-1

When not communicating with a chatbot, the person respond will be slow, unhelpful and unable to provide any substantial information. -The aircraft itself often has defects.

2024-05-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Washington,,,,,,,1,terrible experience,False,"   I am writing about the terrible experience I have been having with the United Airlines customer support team.  I recently booked our honeymoon trip through a travel agency. This trip has a total of 5 flights, 3 with United Airlines and 2 with Swiss Air. When going to Swiss Air's website I was able to upgrade my two flights from economy to premium economy on one and business class on the other. When going to United's website I could only upgrade 2 out of 3. Upon calling your tech support now over 6+ times and also getting my service request escalated, I have received 6 different reasons and solutions. All their reasoning made no sense and their solutions did not work. They even suggested I contact my travel agent and upgrade the class of seat for each flight. But that is insane since I already paid to upgrade 4 of the flights directly and I would essentially be charged double. When I was told I could upgrade the final flight it was with United airline miles, but not cash ? This is where I draw the line. I would have to purchase 40,000 United miles plus $1000 in cash (which I find humorous that they can take cash in this sense but not the other) all to be on a seat waitlist. But I have confirmed with customer support that the premium economy section has plenty of open seating right now and that was the section I wanted to upgrade to. It seems like United Airline’s wants cash customers to pay to upgrade but in my situation I cannot? The other issue is if I purchase United airline miles + cash, all I can get now is put on a waitlist even though there is abundant open seating ? Would you spend your money on miles and hope all the good seats are not purchased by the time they release these seats? I wouldn't! Because if the seats are sold out by that time then I would be screwed twice. If United does not appreciate customers who book their airline through a travel agent, and worse place restrictions on purchasing upgrades directly on United to the customers that do use a travel agent, then may I suggest you remove United Airlines from allowing travel agents to book your flights ! After my July/august booked flights I will never fly United Airlines !",-1

2024-05-30,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Taipei to San Francisco,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,it was a pleasant experience,True,"  I was rebooked on this flight to SFO because I had missed my connecting flight on SQ in Singapore. I flew CI to TPE to catch this flight. United Polaris class is the flagship product of UA. Seats are full flat seats with blanket and duvet from Saks Fifth Avenue. Unlike SQ where the cabin crew comes around to set up your bed, you have to do this yourself on UA. The amenity kit provided is a fabric waist pouch that contains the usual items. Some may like it, some may not. Personally I would prefer a proper zippered toiletries pouch which can be reused for personal toiletries and medications. Lunch service was served on a single tray. I had the beef short ribs and it was surprisingly good considering that steaks served on flights are touch and go. Before landing crepes was served for breakfast. Wifi was available for a fee. The service was efficient - not overly rushed and not overly pampering. There was a mixture of American and Taiwanese crew on board. In summary, despite what has been said about UA in the media and on social media, it was a pleasant experience.",1
2024-05-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Bismarck,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never experienced so many delays,False," I have never experienced so many delays with any airline ever. Flight delayed on the way out and flight delayed on the way back. This is highly unacceptable as they have a whole wing of the airport and they can’t move to a different gate. Disgusting, disgraceful and disappointing. Now I won’t be home in my own bed until 4am.",-1
2024-05-29,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the most uncomfortable flight,False,"   We arrived to the airport at LAX with plenty of time as it is typically very busy there. We expected to fly out on time and get to our destination by 5:30 P.M. local time in Hawaii. That however, did not happen. We got delayed for 6 hours with no explanation other than there was a problem with our plane and we needed to wait for a new one to come in. That also, did not happen! We were told to board our plane at 6:15 P.M. and then told to get back off the plane as there was some issues. We then got delayed some more. They offered a $15.00 coupon to use, but we all know that does not get you anything in an airport. We finally boarded our flight at 7:45 P.M. and left into the air at 8:30 P.M. We should have already been sitting on a beach or checking into our room, but that did not go as planned. We landed in Hawaii at 12:30 A.M. local time. United offered nothing in return. I have called now 3 times and was referred to a website to submit a claim that takes 14 days to process. The air in the flight did not work! The WIFI on the flight did not work! The seats were packed full and it was SO hot! One of the most uncomfortable flights I have taken to date. I will avoid using United anytime I can as this seems to always be the issue. Multiple delays and no explanation to the customer. The rep at the counter was rude to any one who had a question. We had waited ALL day in an airport and were obviously frustrated and instead of helping she basically had no care for the amount of time United had wasted of our trip. When you pay as much money as I did I expect to be able to use my hotel room for the full amount of time that it was booked. I technically did not even need a room for the day of flying there as we did not get there until after midnight. I really hope that in the next 14 days United will step up and return at least the money I spent on the flight there as my husband and I both took off work to just sit in airport instead of being on our vacation.",-1
2024-05-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Denver,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2,experienced the worst flight,True,"  I experienced the worst flight on United airlines this week. I avoid budget or discount airlines but after flying United, I think they may be a superior experience. The flight from Baltimore to Denver is 4 hours. We checked in for both flights exactly 24 hours in advance. Both times we were seated in the last row of the plane. The seats are more upright than any other seat. The lines for the bathroom were continuous. All six rows ahead of us had young children or lap babies, which on a long flight led to lots of crying, as one would expect. We were aware that booking economy meant no carry on luggage, only a personal item. But being in the last row of the plane, the outer wall curves inward and did not even allow for a small piece of luggage. They announced that they had limited food for purchase and it we wanted something we should let the flight attendant know. I did so (as the galley was right behind us). She said we would have to wait. As we were last served, there was no food left. We were traveling with my 86 year old mother. She could not get a boarding pass online, she had to check in at the gate for some reason. She got the last row of the plane on the outgoing flight also. On the return, even the ticket agent could not get her a seat and we had to wait in line at the gate to get her a seat. We are members of their frequent flier program, though they do not fly many nonstop routes from Baltimore, we do not fly with them often.After this trip, it will be my last choice of airlines.",-1
2024-05-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Auckland to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst flying experience,True,"  This was the worst flying experience I have ever had! I booked business class directly through United airlines because I have a medical condition that requires I sit as close to the front of the plane as possible. My ticket one way was $3888. When I arrived at the airport, it seemed like there was some confusion they thought I was supposed to be there at 7am but I had my itinerary and it said 10:35am, the agent said everything was fine and said they couldn’t print my ticket until my next leg. When I got to the international airport they printed my ticket - I again was assured I was in business class, she even put a sticker on my boarding pass saying express lane. It was a 30 min walk through the airport, during the walk I realized I was in row 35 - which is clearly not business class ! The agents at the desk were extremely rude - I ended up in the last seat with 3 toilets behind me and the seat did not recline. To add insult to injury to girl next to me said her ticket was $800, United refuses to refund my money or even let me speak anyone in their customer care department- and they had the nerve to give me 12500 points which is equivalent to $130 dollars.",-1
2024-05-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Halifax to New York JFK via Toronto,2.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,"long winded customer service apologies"" ",False,"   Booked my roundtrip flight, got my confirmation number, receipt and itinerary and called them a few days later because I noticed my first and middle name showed as one name on the reservation. They told me that just how their system displays the name. Got my credit card statement about a month and a half later, no charge from UA. Called them again. They say I don't have a ticket. At this point, I'm supposed to be travelling in 2 weeks and at no point was there an indicator that I did not have a ticket. I had the reservation number plugged into the UA app on my phone and all of my reservation info was there with a countdown for departure. If I didn't check my credit card statement, I would have never known that I didn't have a ticket and would have showed up to the airport with no ticket/boarding pass. Customer service rep tries to help me book a new ticket but only books me a one way, when I had a roundtrip reservation and I ended up paying more for the new flight than I was going to for the original; Original was about $650 and I ended up paying around $820 for the new reservation. And the reason they gave me for the error with ticketing was that it didn't take my credit card because the charge was in US dollars and I had to explain to their rep that I was shown the price in USD and was paying with my USD amex and the website told me that the transaction was successful. I only accepted the re-booking because of where I lived there wasn't another option for a flight to JFK on the same day around that time. The other flights were much too early and I had to go to work earlier that day. Filed a complaint and was told that someone would get back to me within 30 days which they did NOT. And when I was rebooked, my confirmation number was not changed so I had ZERO confidence that I had a ticket because I had already been sent all of this exact information previously! Called them back a few times to confirm that I had a ticket of course because the airport is one of the few places where showing up when you're not supposed to be there is a problem! All they've offered me to date is a $50 voucher toward an ""eligible flight"" with them when I had to spend over $100 of the cost of the initial flight to make up for their mistake. I will also say getting to their customer service team was also a pain and I felt like they were purposefully misunderstanding me when I wanted to file a complaint. They kept telling me that if it had gone through, I would have gotten a receipt and itinerary which I did get. I kept trying to explain that even if there was an issue with the ticketing system, because, as they say, I do NOT have a ticket, my confirmation number should not be valid and working on their website and their App. My major complaint was that at no point did anything in their system that is accessible to me indicate that I did not have a ticket for my flights. They kept giving me long winded customer service apologies, interrupting me as I explained my issue. And I was even more frustrated because I had already called them and spoken to them about this booking and they didn't tell me ""by the way, you don't have a ticket"". What made it finally make sense to someone was me explaining that I would have gone to the airport and would have ended up making a fuss for a boarding pass for a flight that I had a receipt and itinerary for, but I hadn't been paid for because I wasn't charged and would therefore have no right to a ticket.",-1
2024-05-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to San francisco,3.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,I won't fly United again,False,"   Flight delayed multiple times, until over 2 hours. We missed our connecting flight, despite it was also on United. They told they would get us a hotel room, but they made for the departing city. Then after another hour in line, they then stated too close to boarding and we would have to address when we get to destination. When we finally get on the plane, the steward seems more interested in talking to other steward than helping us. From now on, even if i have to pay more, I won't fly United again.",-1
2024-05-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Frankfurt via Newark,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,3,disorganized and poor inflight service,False,"   When I tried to check in online, I received a message that it was not possible to do so and to see an agent at the airport. At the Cancun airport large signs tell you to use the check-in kiosks, so I did what I was told, even though I knew I had to see an agent and that check-in at the kiosks would not work either. When I tried to reach the counter, I was stopped by a United employee (the ""INTERVIEWER"" as it said on the back of his T-shirt) who asked me what was wrong. I told him my story, but he obviously thought I was too stupid to use the machine. Then he tried to check me in at the machine and was told it was not possible. His immediate response was: ""Your ESTA was cancelled!"" He scared me and put me in a lot of distress and did not listen to me when I told him that my ESTA had worked on my inbound flight. He was clearly on a major power trip. After what felt like 15 minutes he finally let me go to the counter where my boarding passes came out of the printer as soon as the lady working there had entered my details. The flight from Cancun to Newark was okay, they gave us a soft drink and a snack and the flight attendants were friendly. The international flight to Frankfurt however was a completely different story. I have never experienced a more disorganized and poor inflight service. After 2 hours in the air, food service started, which was of an incredibly bad quality. The drinks cart started after the meal service, which in my case (seat 59B) meant that I was served the first drop of liquid 2:45 hours after taker off. After a rushed transfer through Newark I was thirsty and exhausted, but the two flight attendants I talked to refused to give me anything to drink since they were ""doing meals"". During the entire 7-hour flight the drinks cart came around exactly once. In the morning they started the service too late, so that the drinks cart did not reach the rear section of the cabin. Why did the crew start distributing meals before serving drinks? The two ladies serving my section clearly hated their jobs and they hated their customers. One of them literally threw the sandwich in my direction. The ticket was cheap, but I'd rather pay more in order to avoid that joke of an airline.",-1
2024-05-21,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vega to San Antonio via Houston,3.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5,“I’m sticking to United”,False," I unfortunately missed my initial flight yesterday with another airline due to not being able to check in my bags, and after rebooking with United for a 6am flight it was missed again. I called the customer service line and I was patched through to a supervisor who helped me tremendously to find a flight leaving on the same day with an economical payout that would not hurt my wallet or have to spend a day and a half at the airport. They are amazing and it is the last time I decide to fly out with an alternate airline. I’m sticking to United for most if not all flights.",1

2024-05-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Cozumel via Houston,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,United Airlines support gets a zero,True,"  United Airlines support gets a zero. 5 airports, 6 Uber rides, 3 airlines, 2 lost bags, 11 support calls. On a recent flight from Columbus CMH to Cozumel CZM, we landed in Houston IAH to make our connection. Lightning prevented landings and departures for several hours, and our connection was one of the flights that got cancelled. United didn’t give us any help getting a flight rebooked – the line at the gate wrapped around the corner and phone support put us on hold indefinitely. We finally found out all United flights were full for the next 2 days, so we booked through Delta. We tried to retrieve our carry-on bags that got checked in CMH, but the baggage claim area was in chaos – no signs, no announcements, multiple lines, people shouting. We waited 3 hours to speak to a representative, who told us to return in 2-3 hours to claim our bags. When we returned, the 300+ people wanting their bags had become an angry mob. At 11pm (15 hours after we’d arrived), they closed the baggage area without anyone getting their bags. We never once saw any security in this area, even though people were coming very close to getting into fights. It was extremely unsafe. We arrived at our destination 30 hours later than planned, with no clothes or medications. We placed more than 10 calls to support during our stay and received different instructions every single time. United finally delivered our bags to our hotel - 12 hours before we checked out to return home.",-1

I cannot justify and would never agree to spending $1400 for a ticket to Florida - I wouldn't gone back to Rome!

We were supposed to leave at 10:10 and were delayed until 1:00. We got a text that the plane was boarding so we went and stood on line for almost 1 1/2 hours until they finally told us that our flight was cancelled. Long story short, we were not able to book another flight for 2 days and we were told that United would reimburse us for meals, lodging and taxis to and from the airport. They told us to keep our receipts and submit them for reimbursement. After spending over 9 hours in the airport we finally left (without our luggage because it couldn't be retrieved until hours later and we had to go back and get it/search for it ourselves). We kept all of our receipts and submitted them to United only to be told ""United's auditors have reviewed them and will approve $580 USD for your expenses. For additional expenses to be considered, please provide receipts that show the items purchased, not just a total of the items purchased."" No one told us at the Zurich airport when my flight was cancelled to keep Itemized receipts!! Instead of being reimbursed $1319.88 USD, we are getting less than half for our inconvenience. Absolutely insulting!! Shame on you United!!",-1

2024-04-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Montreal to Myrtle Beach via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,must check in your carry on,True,"  I have been using airway as almost only way for travel for business and scientific trips for almost 27 years and my experience today was the only experience that I felt an unbelievable intimidated behaviour from any flight related staff. In general, my trips goes nearly 100% smoothly. In my plan , usually flight time is an ideal time to work on the presentation or lecture I am going to present in destination. I hardly remember I have faced very few difficulties in the past 30 years but those were mostly due to a brief chaos in organizing the flight but never ever intimidation or bullying. Today I had an experience that was shocking. During the boarding at 10:30 am April 28 in gate 80 of YUL Montréal airport when it reached to my turn, a boarding agent slightly rudely told me “ you must check in your carry on (this has happened at past for small airplane and even large airplane will full capacity, was fully understandable). I told the guy with smile ”oh no please can I just put under my seat? .look It is perfectly fit “ while I was waiting a kind of friendly explanation. I noted he in very firm and serious attitude and rudely told me “no you must check in“ I said still with smile begging “it is not fair I need to work on my lecture please. Then he turn totally different attitude and told me “either you check in or I will put you out of flight”. I was completely shocked. I told seriously , how come ? Ok well if I have no choice put the tag but there is no need for demonstration of power and I took the bag to board . while I was entering he said “actually I will not allow you to board. I was honestly scared I said ok sorry and continued. He said stop even if you get in we will take you out. Put the bag in check in place and took the seat. Later when a female staff of boarding team came on board “I told her with smile see ma’am there are many empty places in overhead “ ironically the portion on my over head was empty. To my surprise I realized she had came after me she said : you shouldn’t have talked to him like that and I am going to ask you get off the plane. I said “ I am sorry I did not mean to be rude to him “ she said no you need to get off. I said you can tell him to come I personally apologize but she said he can not come and she took a photo of my seat number and left.  I can understand if a person pose aggressive behaviour, or threaten others to be treated this way but a harmless passenger that indicates a different story about the culture in your company about treating a customer. Interestingly, they lost a security belt on my bag but I did not care as my trip was ruined.",-1

Since our destination changed and we had to make it to Las Vegas before Midnight! With all previous flights with different airlines the delays constantly we weren't sure and very nervous if our plan will work out. We had 50 different flights during the year with all different airlines and mostly international and Business Class. So far United even so we flew economy (partially with upgraded seats on the way back to Miami) was so far the best experience, no issues, no delays, inoperable lavatory, engine failure, aircraft removed from service, no oil leak, aircraft to hot and more during our past flights with other airlines. But United Airplane was very clean on time spacious very comfortable seats. The Staff very professional and neat. Our Flight Attendants, David and James, were very professional and friendly. They had a small talk with us while serving drinks and heard from my husband bragging that we are getting married this very same day in Las Vegas. We got congratulated and received a bottle of sparkling wine as a gift from and in the name of United Airlines. Our best Experience and we loved the special Attention and wanted to say again. Thank you for the special treatment it was very special for us and very kind from David and James and United Airlines very special gesture.",1

This action removed 25% of my birthday vacation. Instead of flying direct, he switched me to a layover flight, 2 hours further west of my destination. He put my wife and I on opposite ends of the plane. This 1 action set me back over 650$USD. They then screwed up the plane in Houston, causing an extra cpl hour delay. I cannot express my dissatisfaction enough. Do not ever fly with UA, or let anyone you love fly with United Airlines. They are going to swindle you, and then send you halfway across the country because the English guy at guest services ""didn't get a break yet"". I have filed complaints with the better business bureau and will never be flying UA again. I learned the hard way why you cannot fly with just any old airline.

There seems to be aircraft mechanical problems every TIME i fly and they cannot seem to fix them. They continuously do multiple delays and cancel, or my personal favorite the pilot takes the plane out 5 hours late and then times out on the runway because they are “overtime “ and in violation of FAA regulations. You haven’t even been in the air and could have been sleeping for hours but you are “overtime “.

I was gifted a ticket. Once seated I learned I needed to download the United app to purchase food & drink. I downloaded but was unable to provide my frequent flyer # so I couldn't complete the registration before being told to turn off my phone. When the steward came by I asked for a cocktail & showed my credit card. When the steward declined, I told her I had cash. With a smirk she stated United is ""cashless"" and I would be unable to purchase anything. One would think someone who is employed in a customer service capacity would understand ""good will and ill will"" and comp 1 drink and 1 food item for a customer who had cash and credit to pay but could not complete United's ridiculous requirement to register an app. I have never liked United as I have always found United to be arrogant.

2024-04-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Knoxville to Austin via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a masterclass in incompetence,True,"  United Airlines epitomizes everything wrong with modern air travel, and I wouldn't wish their services on my worst enemy. My recent ordeal with them was a masterclass in incompetence, indifference, and outright disregard for customer well-being. The saga began with a flight delay caused by a hole in their aircraft's roof, a charming surprise that made me miss a critical corporate training session. United's solution? None. Instead, I had to fork out for an American Airlines ticket to salvage my plans, an expense and inconvenience I should never have faced. On the return leg, United managed to outdo themselves with yet another delay, showcasing their consistent commitment to inefficiency. Their gate agents, a delightful bunch of unhelpful individuals, refused to let me purchase a ticket from another passenger for an earlier flight, despite available seats mocking me from afar.  The hotel United tossed me into during a layover was straight out of a horror movie. Ratty, dingy, and surrounded by characters that would make even the bravest soul uneasy, it was a testament to United's impeccable taste in hospitality. Now, let's delve into the circus of trying to get a refund. Starting with their one sided refund request form that allows for three whole sentences of why you deserve a refund with no room to have a discussion with anyone. Weeks of back-and-forth, endless bureaucratic hurdles, and what did I get in return? A laughable sum that barely scratched the surface of the inconvenience and frustration their circus of an airline caused. In conclusion, if you enjoy being treated like a disposable inconvenience, book with United Airlines. If not, do yourself a favor and choose an airline that values passengers as more than just cattle to be herded and disregarded.",-1
2024-04-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Quebec City via Newark,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,speechless as to my experience,False,"   My flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Newark, was scheduled to leave at 5:05pm. We boarded late(which happens) and sat on the runway for 3 hours in the plane with NO AC and no water, nothing. It was very hot and unbelievably inhumane. At one point the pilot even turned off all engines… After this sauna, we were taken back to the terminal as we were told that the pilot couldn’t fly as his time had expired or something like that. I missed my connection to Quebec city from Newark. I asked for my money back and was told I couldn’t. Then, I asked the woman at the counter if I could take the flight the next day, to which she tells me that this mess will start all over again if I do that, I should simply take the flight which at that point was supposed to leave at 9:30pm. Is this something you do every day? Are you putting people on a plane every day and let them sit in the heat for 3 hours on the runway? Anyway, I decided to take the 9:30pm flight. The flight didn’t take off until after 11pm. My connection was the next morning at 9am. I was traveling with my 13 year old daughter, we were flying to take care of my mother as she had to have emergency heart surgery. We had to stay up all night waiting for our next flight, we were exhausted. We get on the plane the next morning, started to go down towards the airport, we could see the ground, then we go back up above the clouds, because they said visibility was bad, we then flew to Vermont to get gas… People don’t believe me when I tell them the story… because it is that unbelievable! It took us 20 hours to reach our destination which on a direct flight would take 3.5 hours. I am speechless as to my experience.",-1

United is pretty consistently the worst airlines for so many reasons. I think their rude flight attendants are my biggest complaint. They scattered our family with your children throughout the plane. When we requested to move our seats they told us they were full. The flight attendant yelled at someone who tapped her to ask her something during The flight. I am kind of unsure how this airline is even in business with their truly awful customer service model . We have flown ""discount "" airlines with 1000 times better service. It's kind of sad that they treat customers so poorly.",-1

Our flights were canceled multiple times due to runway closures and construction in San Francisco. We spent 25 hours in an airport because of your poor planning. Why would you book people on flights that you cannot guarantee! And when we asked for help your representatives had no clue what they were doing! From telling us you booked us on another flight that you didn't! To telling us that our bags would be going to our final destination, which they didn't! It was by pure luck that we stopped at the carousel and surprise surprise our bags were there. To the rude representative at the boarding counter. You guys are an absolute embarrassment!

My original flight should have gotten me to Fort Myers Florida at 11:02 AM. IT IS now7:30 PM. No flight on the horizon all due to weather. I understand the problem. I'm writing this to tell you that although I'm not happy being put in this position I congratulate every employee of United Airlines for being so patient with all of us and kind.

Aircraft and Product were very good all staff was a very nice except one flight attendant was rude, aggressive and totally in the wrong job. I did let him know I have a service dog with me I showed him papers but he didn’t care if this is service dog he told me I can’t have him by me. He basically was standing behind my chair every min so he can see if the dog is inside cage he was so annoying. For 10 years of flying with my dog have any experience like that.",-1

To make matters worse, we had his physical passport with us in DC! The supervisor at the UNITED terminal did her very very very best so my son could catch up and make his connecting flight. They could have closed the doors, closed the gate, found him alternative delayed travel options, but this lady, went above and beyond to give my son every chance to make the International connecting flight and he did! It was the start of our Spring break vacation and she optimized our chances to travel as a family. We are so grateful! This type of service builds allegiance to the airline.

Every phone call takes 20 minutes and you get different answers each time, after two months and 15 days and the letter that said that we will not be compensated today.

2024-03-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1,rude and didn’t provide a solution,False,"  My flight was delayed for 2 hours. I was going to lose my second flight so I asked for other options at the counter in SFO. The counter attendant told me that the only option could be just not to go to my destination. That was really rude and didn’t provide a solution. My flight keep being delayed even after the boarding. We were on board for an hour and 25 mins. Finally came to Denver but when I got here, I asked another United attendant to help me with my rebooked. And she didn’t even say sorry neither offer me vouchers or any type of credit for the inconvenience in my first flight. I ended up just calling on the phone and asked for them and the person told me I can only get them in the counter. So I called again and spoke to someone else on the phone and he finally helped me. He was nice. However , I couldn’t use the meal voucher in Mc Donald’s which was the only restaurant open. I ended up just eating salami and cheese from another airport store. Also, It wasn’t worth it to go to the hotel because I only had 3 hours to come back to the airport for my next flight. Honestly, this was my first time flying with United And I think would be my last time as well. I think it was just enough. I have been in the airport 3 hours. And still need to wait another 2 hour for my boarding time to the next flight to Orlando.",-1
2024-03-27,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cleveland to Washington,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,does not care about customer service,True,"  United lost my luggage on a recent flight to Dulles. Since I had multiple business meetings to attend, I needed to go buy clothes and toiletries the night I arrived. After chatting with multiple United agents when I arrived in DC, they told me to go buy what I needed for my trip. I had  2 agents tell me they will reimburse me what I lost. In two separate chat sessions, I specifically asked about my cologne and headphones I use for running. I have screen captures of the agents telling me United would reimburse me for those items. When I turned in my claim (which I did not even list the time it took me to go buy everything I lost which ended up to be several hours), United Baggage Claim denied paying for the cologne and headphones, saying both those items are on their ""Excluded"" list. I proceeded (multiple times) to send the screenshots of my chat conversation with their agents, but they did not care. I told them multiple times that since the chats were considered ""binding conversations"" between myself and United, but it took me almost 2 months of phone calls, chats, and emails for United to finally make it right and reimburse me for those items. To make things worse, when I sent a couple emails to United Mileage Plus and United Customer Care to complain about my entire experience, not one agent offered any type of compensation for my trouble. They simply told me it is a Baggage Claim issue. I certainly did not expect financial compensation, which I could have knowing how many hours it took me to purchase the items that United lost. But one would think the airline would offer to give me miles towards a future flight to make up for their mistake. But no, not United. United obviously does not care about customer service or the customer experience. As long as they got your money.",-1

This is 3rd time I fly with United via Houston: - each time I miss my connecting flight whether it is to Austin, Costa Rica or Panama - plane left late (like other times).

2024-03-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolute worst airline to fly with,True,"  Awful airline! I spent $3k on tickets due to the weekend we were flying. Our plane was delayed 4 hours which they kept saying was due to the air traffic. Turns out it was due to the pilot walking off, it had nothing to do with air traffic. We finally get to board and my premium economy seats that I paid extra money for were given away as a free upgrade and they tried to split my seats and shove us in the back of the plane. I tried to contact customer service for a refund and they refuse saying I have no grounds for a refund and that the best they can do is a $75 United credit. As if I would ever fly United again, they are the absolute worst airline to fly with. You buy protection on your tickets and then you can’t even get your money back when the airline messes up majorly.",-1
2024-03-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Denver,,,,,,,1,customer service was horrible,False,"  They have changed our flight two times, and the last time they changed it, they didn't allow us to choose our seats so our family is unable to sit with each other. We booked it through Chase, and we could not change reservations through Chase, but only through the airline. We have never had this issue as with booking through Chase Travel, we have always been able to manage it through them. When we called them, they said UA needs to be dealt with directly. We called their customer service, which was horrible. The Automated voice walkthrough is horrendous. When expressing the concern about not sitting with our family, they said ""it happens"". With who? Not with Delta, not with AA. I have never had this issue before. I will not be booking through UA again.",-1

On the way back, our flight from Chicago to Toronto (via United) got delayed leading to us missing our next flight from Toronto to Dubai with Air Canada. United doesn't have a desk at Toronto airport but Air Canada team went extra mile, got in touch with United on phone who re-booked us on Emirates. We were also advised to stay overnight (it was 2am) in a hotel and all reasonable expenses incurred will be reimbursed. Our luggage was not with us and we had no clothes/toiletries etc When we submitted our claim with receipts, United said they will only pay $200 per passenger which hardly covers cost of hotel and food but nothing else. This is very unfortunate and not appropriate way to treat business class travelers! wonder if I could do anything else",-1

When I bought the tickets it had a 2 1/2 hour connection which was enought to get thru customs and immigration. They then changed the schedule for connecting International to Domestic flight to 1:40 minutes which is less than the MCT (minimum connection time) Now we found out they changed the connecting flight with a six hour layover. I would have never bought these tickets with this kind of schedule. Called and they weren't willing to help us out...wanted to charge us for the same flight the following day if we choose to spend the night instead of sitting at the airport for six hours getting us home at 1:00 am. I have two United credit cards but will be getting rid of those and start flying Alaska or Delta.,-1

I read many negative reviews online and was terrified the flight would be a disaster. It was a fairly uneventful and easy two flights. Both planes  were definitely newer and comfortable - as much as economy can be. The stewards were polite, welcoming, and helpful. Our bags arrived at our destination safe and sound, and so did we. I came to write this review specifically to counteract all the negative reviews I read, as I know that negative reviews tend to get posted more than positive. I would fly with United Airlines again.",1

I had an isle seat (important because I'm 6'5"" tall and I like to be able to stretch my legs out in the isle occasionally throughout a long flight). The next morning I pulled up my itinerary to find that I had been changed to a flight several hours later in the day for some reason. I got to the airport and got changed back to the original flight, but lost my seat.

2024-03-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,2the most terrible airline,False," This is the most terrible airline you could imagine. My bags were approximately 12 pounds overweight, so one of the helpful, nice staff members told me I should take some things out, put them in a plastic bag given to me by the staff there, and then carry that on (and check my carry on). I emptied the ~12 pounds out of my suitcase and asked another staff member if I could have a second plastic bag so that I could double bag my things so it wouldn’t rip. She immediately started telling me that I couldn’t do that, and started rudely demanding that I put all of my things back in suitcases, which I just spent time unpacking. It took approximately 45 minutes for the United Airlines staff to help the 5 individual, or groups of 2 people in front of me, people were at the desk trying to get their tickets for 30 minutes each. And then I was there being detained for another 45 minutes while the staff member ignored me after she demanded I put everything back in my bags. She wouldn’t even look at me, or talk to me while she slowly helped everyone who was behind me. I had to ask customer service representatives working at the neighbouring desks to even let me weigh my bags. I was there almost 3 hours early, and I genuinely thought she was going to cause me to miss my flight- I got to the gate just as the second zone for my flight was boarding. My suitcases were carefully packed because I am going to two different climates, so have boots, shoes, jackets- I things for both a cold and warm climate, and I couldn’t get everything back in my suitcases. Someone from the line was trying to help me force the things back into my suitcases while I was trying to rush so as not to miss my flight while staff ignored me. The suitcase (which was previously given to me by Air Canada when they broke the wheel on my original suitcase)- so it is not the best quality, started ripping at the seams and breaking so that my things were coming out when it was zipped up. The staff was still arguing that I couldn’t get on the plane with a plastic bag as my carry on, which makes no sense because I had one personal item, and a plastic bag that fit the size requirements for a personal item- I genuinely felt like I was going to miss my flight because of her, and she didn’t care, wasn’t even looking at me, wasn’t helping me- was ignoring me. The nice staff member (I wish I had gotten her name, because the world needs more reasonable, kind, helpful people like her) told me that she would check all my bags including my original carry on, and let me take my personal item and the plastic bag as my carry on item. It was easy to carry and the same size as a regular carry on. So now I have to buy two suitcases when I get to my destination, because the staff caused my suitcase to break by forcing me to try & force everything back in it on the middle of the airport floor after another staff member had just told me to take everything out. Then they made me sign something saying that the suitcase was already broken when I got there.",-1

2024-03-01,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Chicago O'Hare,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,we had a good flight,True,"  I am not sure if we were just lucky or what judging from some of the other poor reviews of United but we had a good flight with them and I thought they were OK. I would fly with them again. We got a cheap ticket compared to some of the other airlines on offer. I was pleasantly surprised by the legroom in economy. It was about a 9 hour flight going and just under 8 coming back. The food was basic rice and Chicken/pasta type fare but edible and a pizza roll/breakfast bagel later on. The entertainment was a large selection of movies, TV and games. Staff were polite but kept busy. The flights were both on time and the plane in economy was about three quarters full so there was room to spread out a bit. We were delayed about 20 minutes going due to a technical fault but made the time up on route.",1
2024-02-29,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to San Francicso,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2,do my best to avoid United,True,"  Significant delays that could be avoided with expedited boarding. Took 45 minutes to board the plane, but United prioritized class differentiation over flight punctuality, even when the flight was already delayed 30 min. This caused additional delays on the tarmac, and the flight was ultimately 70 min late. On arrival, a flood of missed-transfer folks were being jammed off the plane, further delaying all others. Seat assignment: Economy now means they auto-assign your seat - after a forced airport check-in (boarding pass says ""See Agent"")! Extremely inefficient process: forced to check in online, then at the airport kiosk, then at the agent desk (despite having no checked bags). Plus I'm assigned a middle seat despite the window seat being open. Are these inefficiency tactics (for both passenger and airline) designed to humiliate me into paying more next time to choose a seat? Or just poor fulfillment software? What a mess. Seat: Knees jammed into front seat (although I am 6'2), all storage pouches destroyed. Service: flight attendants were nicer than my previous United flights. Verdict: Despite living in SF, I will do my best to avoid United in the future.",-1

2024-02-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Lima,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"What a fiasco"" ",False,"   On both our incoming and outgoing trip to Peru, United Airlines was massively delayed for hours due to some technical issue. What made it so frustrating in the Lima airport is that when we try to check in, the people on the same delayed flight were pretty much delineated from the other people with different flights and were made to wait a bit longer. It was really frustrating to arrive early and then have all the other folks who came later than you leapfrogged over. This made it very frustrating since my husband and I could have used that time to be chilling in the lounge. United should compensate for the pain and suffering that they put us thru—- not just on the delay but also for the added insult of having to wait longer than normal to check in and drop our bags. What a fiasco. I will think twice about choosing United again when we fly.",-1
2024-02-26,0.8,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Dallas to Cancun via Houston,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4,comfortable and spacious,True,"  On the DFW-IAH outbound flight, there was no cabin service due to the very short duration. Flight departed on time and landed on time. Premium Economy seating on the Boeing 737-9 Max and 737-900 is very comfortable and spacious. No delays outbound to CUN and inbound to IAH. Cabin crew on both legs provided friendly service. Slight delay inbound to DFW from IAH. Again, limited cabin service was provided due to very short duration of flight. We appreciated the pilot flying at a lower level altitude to turbulent weather.

Again they’re collecting your carry on items before boarding the plane which makes no sense as then they could simply say no carry on items allowed and then at least people can plan accordingly. The airplane was ridiculous in size, age, comfort. I have never seen anything like this! It’s 2024 and that was a flight like I’d have expected it in the 80s. If even. I was close to not even getting on this aircraft.",-1
2024-02-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Honolulu via Chicago,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,1.0,2,Such terrible customer service,True,"  The Flight from PIT to ORD pushed back from the gate, but then the pilot said there was an issue with the brakes. So we went back to the gate and sat there for 90 minutes. The plane was in PIT all night long – why wasn’t someone checking out the plane and making it sure it was ready to go first thing in the morning.  They let us get off the plane in PIT, and we tried to book another route to HNL that day (via NWK), but then United customer service told us to get back on the plane, because we could still get to ORD and make our connection. But there were more delays once we got back on the plane. It finally took off 2 hours late, and there was some small hope that we could make the connection in ORD. But then there were air traffic delays in ORD (which United should have seen ahead of time!) 3. When we finally landed in ORD we ran to the nearby gate for the connection to HNL only to learn that the flight had departed ten minutes previously. There were 20 passengers making the connection from the PIT flight to the HNL flight. United could have easily held the flight for another 15 minutes (the flight was scheduled to land EARLY in HNL as it was!) to allow all of us passengers to make the connection. Your failure to do this demonstrates your complete lack of care regarding your customers. Your customer service options totally suck. We tried to use the kiosks in ORD to rebook a flight, but they were not working.  No one answered your customer service phone line.  The line at the customer service desk was over 50 people long.  I tried to use a Day pass to enter a United Club near the gate, but they were not accepting Day Passes.  We walked to another United Club and I used a Day pass to enter and get help from the customer service agents there. While the agent was helping, she was providing options, and I needed to discuss them with my wife who was waiting outside. I went to get her so she could help make a decision re rescheduling our route to HNL, but the women at the front of the United Club would not let her in without a day pass – even though we did not want to use the facilities, did not want to stay, and only wanted to get our flights rescheduled. I demanded to speak with the manager who took his time coming to speak with me, and then he was a corporate tool and would not let my wife in for 5 minutes to help with this rerouting, either. Such terrible customer service, for what was already a bad experience, was completely absurd and unacceptable.  We got rebooked on a flight to SFO and then on the HNL, but when we went to the gate for the flight to SFO, it was delayed by 3 hours! So we would miss the connection to HNL! (that flight was eventually delayed by 6 hours total. Can United not keep your planes in working order?! Seriously?!)  So, we got rebooked again on the flight to HNL the next day – missing an entire day of our vacation in Hawaii. Thanks a lot United!  The agents that rebooked us for the next day arranged a hotel voucher at a not very impressive hotel in a sketchy part of Chicago, and gave us some food vouchers. But they did not tell us that the food vouchers were only valid inside the airport. Even though the vouchers say they work like any prepaid credit card, they do not! They only work at airport locations. This is not helpful when we are going to a hotel at noon and need to wait until the next day at 10 AM to fly out.",-1

It’s actually kind of sad the planning of their flights never fails to cause a longer travel time. I would rather spend twice the money and fly with no stops, than every single flight that offers layover delaying hours past the actual time they provide. Or they could just put accurate departure times. I won’t fly United unless the ticket is basically free.",-1
2024-02-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to O’Hare,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1,“second time United has split our family up”,False," We booked our flight many months ago, as a family of four with two small children. United didn’t give my husband a seat number, and when I called they told me he would have to get it at the gate. At the gate they gave a boarding pass and sat him in the front row even though we were are the very back of the plane. This is the second time in the past year United has split our family up and not notified us until we are at the gate. And if we wanted my husband to sit with us? $104 up charge for ONE seat change. Additionally, we had two extra small carry on kid suitcases which they made us pay $35 each to check because our ticket selection was the most basic. We took American Airlines on our way there for the same trip and it was lovely. They made an effort to sit our family together without any up charge and had a normal carry on/personal item allowance.",-1
2024-02-05,0.7,Solo Leisure,First Class,Chicago to Sioux falls,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5,have a slight preference for Delta,True,"  First class on this first short 1-hour domestic flight. I’ve flown a few similar flights with United. Crew is professional. They served drinks before takeoff which is nice. Seats were comfortable, plane was well maintained. They’ve removed all in flight entertainment screens which is appealing. I’d like to use my phone for things other than watching a movie. They only served biscuits and chips which is sad. Paul on my ORD - FSD flight (8 pm) was wonderful. I’d still fly United First but I have a slight preference for Delta because of the IFE part.",1
2024-02-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lexington KY to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,“do not check your bags”,False," Anyone reading this, if you’re flying United do not check your bags. Take it on board with you and worst case they will tag it on the jet bridge. Another trip, another opportunity for them to not have my luggage when I arrived at my final destination. Also bring some type of ear buds! I had a guy next to me snoring for three hours and the guy behind him also snoring for over 2. I said something to the flight and he said there was nothing he could do. First class means nothing with issues like this. I paid more and was subjected to this. My luggage was found and brought to me the next afternoon after checking into my hotel the previous evening. Thanks United for doing anything you could to make my trip to Vegas one I wish I could forget. I also sent in feedback to them complaining about everything. Three days now and no response. Sadly, I’m not surprised or maybe they’re extremely busy responding to others who experienced the same on other flights.",-1

2024-01-30,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Brussels to Des Moines via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"no apology, no compensation",True,"  It started on January 3rd at 10:10AM with the first flight from Brussels to Chicago with UA 973. Half an hour into the flight there was a medical emergency and we had to return to the gate. It happens and needs to be done. After an inspection for the overweight landing, we were good to go with just 3 hours delay, not a problem. And then, the flight attendants didn't want to fly, too many hours they claim? Flight Cancelled. Everybody back to the gate area where they United staff made the statement that there will be no re-booking due to the large number of passengers, everybody on hotel and with the same plane the next day, at 1PM (27 hours delay) we later heard. Next day, ready to go, boarding time passes and a shouting match starts between several United staff members, even the police had to intervene. Then, 1 hour later, hello everyone, we cancel this flight too. That is where panic starts, my business trip turned into a nightmare. Since it was past 2PM, all US flights had of course departed. Rush to the counter, proposal BRU-to London- Washington- Chicago and finally Desmoines with the statement ""check in Washington for faster connection"". Arrival January 5th 11AM, 37 hours delay! So, flight to London, no boarding passes yet for the next flight, rush to a United counter, got the passes and they said run, the flight is closing the doors. During the 15-minute sprint I noticed that a was downgraded from Premium Eco to ECO. At the gate I explained the situation with my original tickets, they say that they can't find my reservation? ""Get on the plane now or stay behind"" with free seats available. In Washington, United counter, ""What are you doing here, you should be in Chicago"" explained the situation, well, it ended with ""Why did i fly from Chicago to Washington"". Gave up, stressed without believe and major back pain, yes that is why i need a minimum of premium ECO. Next stop Chicago at close to midnight, dead tired. At yet another United counter full explanation, i was told, ""there is the gate, departure in 9hours"". In a closed airport, needless to say i demanded a hotel to sleep and shower. Thankfully I got at least that. For the rest no apology, no compensation, nothing from United Airlines.",-1
2024-01-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Newark,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,time to review training your staff,True,"  United, maybe it’s time to review training your staff. Starting the day at 6:00am with an attendant who wouldn’t check me in because she couldn’t figure out my Schengen Visa. Surely this is something you learn before working at an international airport? Next, did your attendants ever learn to count at school? Everyone is ushered into the plane, only to have bins small bins, no help whatsoever, and chaos abound. We were told to then walk back out of the plane and check in our carry on luggage all the way to our final destination, a 20 hours later. The reason we have carry on bags is because we need the items in them- they nearly did not even give us half a second to remove insulin and medication from the bags.",-1

I wanted to make sure that there wasn’t problem when I was flying. I called special services and spoke to Thelma on the phone. Not only did she help me fill out all the forms correctly but she also told me what I would need to fly with them next time and everything that I would have to do before I fly. She was incredibly patient and talked me through every detail. She also sent me the DOT form just so that I had the proper form for my next flight. Being that I’m not very tech savvy I really appreciated this greatly. When you’re ill having an issue while flying is draining. Thelma really made my flight a breeze.

2024-01-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sioux Falls to Spokane via Denver,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,2,“plane was hot and stuffy”,True," The plane from FSD to DEN was hot and stuffy - absolutely no need for the heat to be at that level on a full flight. The flight from DEN to GEG had music blasting during boarding. Aretha Franklin, George Michael, etc. People were trying to get situated, read, etc. while obnoxiously loud and upbeat music played. Not everyone likes the same music and not everyone is coming from a time zone where they'd want music blasting. Additionally, the space under the seats was so unusually narrow that most backpacks wouldn't even fit. My personal item that had fit neatly under my seat during my first flight was now a few inches too big. Instead of the luggage bins being used for luggage, about half of the bins contained backpacks. My medicine, food, and other personal things one would want near them in their PERSONAL item had to be stowed away. All to save a buck. If you want to buy something you are forced to download the app and upload your card information. They say it's so there's contactless payment, however a chip and tap reader has been perfectly adequate up until now apparently. The cutesy safety demonstration that played on the chair screens won't help your PR when it's obvious you don't give two flying poos about your customers.",-1
2024-01-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tokyo Narita,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst AVML on any flight so far,False," San Francisco to Tokyo Narita leg of my itinerary was operated by United. Boarding started 30 min late. The announcements of the two gates, the other being for Singapore, kept mixing creating an unprofessional start to the flight. As a vegetarian I picked AVML meal. I was served the worst AVML on any flight so far. Especially the supposedly dinner was a mushy mix of oats, with lots of cinnamon and raisin with piece of Naan bread. Then second leg from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok with ANA flight was like a dream. How come Japan could do so well and United sucks so miserably. Hey United people, please go fly a few times with ANA economy and learn how decent airlines work.",-1
2024-01-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Sydney,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,won’t recommend United to others,True,"  The worst airline ever! Would give a “0” if i could! All the flight attendants in our flight were so rude, no manners and very unprofessional! Our flight was from LOS ANGELES to SYDNEY on United 839, departing 18th January 2024. We encountered 3 flight attendants, and not even one of them was decent!! We have never been treated this way with any other airlines! We travelled as a group of 6. One of our 4 sons has nuts allergy. The man asked if he wanted butter chicken or pasta. And my older son told him that his brother has a nut allergy. The man said. “Well I don’t know if the food contain any nuts. You need to request it prior to the flight.” Then he just walked past and served others. My husband had to call him and said, “My son didn’t get his food. He wanted the pasta!” No apology from him! For breakfast time, he also missed my eldest son. Then my husband called him again, and the man said so rudely, “Well he didn’t respond to me so I thought he didn’t want it!” We sat behind our 3 sons, and we definitely saw that he only asked our son on the aisle seat. He went past so in hurry serving other customers on the other side. We couldn’t believe how rude he was! Second flight attendant was also very rude! My 5 year old son was sitting next to me on the window seat. He is the most well behaved 5 yo kids I know. During the entire 15 hours flight, he was quiet, sleeping well, and sitting happily playing games on his iphone and watching the in flight movies. Around 5am he was already awake, so he started playing piano on his phone. It was not loud at all, because I was sitting next to him. There was a point he put the volume to max for 2 seconds, and I told him to turn down which he immediately did. Suddenly this woman came to my husband, and said in a very rude and aggressive way, saying, “He is not supposed to play on his phone while everyone else is sleeping!” I was very angry and said, “he is not even loud!” I showed her the phone and the volume was 1. And she said, “I was there and could hear him from afar!” And just left! Unbelievable behaviour! The third attendant - we called the help button as my son needed something. She came and said, “It’s very bumpy! We can’t get out!” (She could just wait for a few more seconds and said sorry I couldn’t come right away!) Another incident, she gave my son the wrong breakfast. My 5yo were sitting on 50L. She gave him the food which labelled 50E. Luckily I checked first, it is a meal with special dietary/allergy requests. So we called the help button, it wasn’t her who came to us. She said, “Oh glad you noticed that!” My husband replied, “Of course we noticed!” It could have been a disaster that someone else’s meal was served to the wrong person! No apology at all! No saying thank you that we actually didn’t eat the meal! Such disgusting manners from all these 3 flight attendants. Our first time flying with United, and will never ever fly with them again! Our flight wasn’t cheap too. Travelling 6 of us, we paid around $2000 AUD per person! So in total, we spent a good $12K. We definitely won’t recommend United to others!",-1
2024-01-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to Chicago,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,1,“Shame on you”,True," To the executive leadership of the United Airlines: You are now charging a fee for small carryon bags? What a genius idea. The size of planes didn’t change. The size of overhead compartments didn’t change. What also didn’t change is your sick greed. You’re now not allowing even a carryon? And also no water or snack or drink on flight? You’re basically decreasing service, and increasing fees to line your pockets. At least if you paid your employees more. What’s next? You’re going to charge a fee for passengers to pre-pay for their masks and flotation devices if there’s an emergency? What’s next? You’ll bring your flight staff down to minimum wage and expect passengers to tip them to compensate? You’re absolutely disgusting. Shame on you.",-1

2024-01-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Dallas,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,“it was a terrible experience”,True," I bought ticket from Lufthansa and didn’t know that they were working with United Airlines. From Frankfurt to Houston and from Houston to Dallas I flew with United. From start to end it was a terrible experience. Frankfurt-Houston flight delayed 1.5 hours. Before the flight in the security check they didn’t explain that I need to take my baggage in Houston and re-check for Dallas. Cabin crew were so rude, and not helpful (except food service personnel). Houston to Dallas flight time was 8.10 pm and I was running to catch it, because the plane landed in Houston at 7 pm. When I came to the gate saw that Dallas flight postponed 2.5 hours (and gate changed three times) After long wait, I was in Dallas at 12 am, but this time I waited for my baggage and learned that they are in Houston in US customs. The person in baggage claim was very rude and not helpful, just was saying that it was my mistake. After 7 hours from the landing to Houston (Houston-Dallas takes 4 hours by car), I was at home at 2 am without my baggage and in a very tired condition. It was my first connected flight from Europe and it was terrible experience. I strongly suggest people to find direct flights even if the wait time is longer.",-1
2024-01-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati OH to Austin Texas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,“the last time I take United Airlines”,True," My flight was delayed four times due to the weather conditions. I started traveling at 9:00am eastern time. The first flight was delayed in Cincinnati due to the weather in Chicago. At that point I should have been provided the option to travel at a later time. Instead I was put on a plane to Chicago where I was scheduled to depart at 12:40pm. The flight was not only delayed but the there was a gate change also resulting in several people needing to rush from B19 to C30 which is a good 10 - 15 minutes away. At 5:00 pm we were informed that the flight was canceled. United Airlines was unavailable by phone due to the amount of customers attempting to make contact. After standing in line for 2 hours to watch unprofessional employees get frustrated due to the weather delays. Not only did they get frustrated they walked away from customers to get dinner, texted and entertained social media why people waited for assistance. The airline refused to pay for a hotel and offered a $15 meal ticket to accommodate someone sitting 20 hours in the airport away from home. Not to mention it was -8 degrees outside and they didn’t even offer the customers a blanket. This will most definitely be the last time I take United Airlines anywhere. I hope to leave at 9:00 am as scheduled!",-1

2024-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no better than Spirit or Frontier,True," The seat assignments and boarding is similar to an cheapo airline. They make you pay for a seat assignment and then only give you an option for a seat in the far back of the plane. The flight is full, but there are plenty of seats available in the front of the plane for even more money. So, it appears that if you do not pay for a seat assignment, then those vacant seats must be assigned to those folks who didn’t pay for a seat assignment. United is becoming no better than Spirit or Frontier Airlines. What a joke.",-1

Flying on jets like the 787 is always good. Inflight entertainment with favorite movies, free Wi-Fi with T-Mobile, mood lighting, and larger overhead bins. It would've been better if United served free food and not food for purchase. But other than that, with an amiable cabin crew and a safe flight with a few turbulences, I can't say enough about it.",1

I was unable to check-in, called the United Customer Service, they claimed I owed money even though my new flight offered a credit for which I received an email confirming the credit. Told me it was a mistake, I have no credit, and that they can do an even exchange eliminating what I now ""owed"" for the ticket. Unbelievably sketchy business practice to not re-issue a ticket after confirming the new flight and then claiming customers owe more money when asking to check-in.",-1
2023-12-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Scranton to Chicago via Houston,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,“this airline has become completely awful”,True," I would give 0 stars if I could. I had a flight from AVP (UA 1446) to ORD (UA2665) to IAH. First flight was delayed for over an hour & not a single team member even attempted to notify us. We waited & waited, receiving zero information regarding the delay. Once we were finally on the plane, we waited another 20 minutes without reason. Once we landed, we waited for 45 minutes just to get off. This left me with less than 10 minutes to make it to my next gate… and the walk was estimated to be 18 minutes. On my way off of the first plane, I told the flight attendant at the front my situation & asked if she could help me in any way possible. She ROLLED her eyes at me & was entirely dismissive. I am astonished that United would even consider hiring someone so rude. Once off, I sprinted to my next gate, which is absolutely unacceptable. I have asthma & nearly collapsed due to such heavy breathing & wheezing. Several people approached me, asking if I was okay & if I need help… yet not a single worker. Absolutely awful. I had tears falling down my face the entire run to the gate because I was so frustrated. I finally got to the gate, panting, & noticed that passengers were getting off the plane. I stopped a man & politely asked him what was going on & he told me that the plane was having “technical difficulties” and that our flight was delayed. That being said, I sprinted (and nearly passed out) all for nothing. I checked the app several times & nothing was changed so I had no idea. I have flown United since I was a child & am extremely disappointed. The last 2-3 years, this airline has become completely awful. I used to love traveling & now dread it when I fly with United. I much rather fly with Delta or Southwest. Save your time, money, & energy and fly with someone else.",-1

Not anymore. I noticed it a couple of years ago, how the airline is getting worse. Now it is the worst one I’ve been on by far. I was traveling from Corpus Christi to Manila Philippines Saturday December 9th on the 7:20 am flight to Houston. My flight was delayed due to mechanical failure. I was stuck in Corpus airport for almost 8 hours. Watch planes come and go to Houston. While I’m being told there’s no room for me yet. As if I already don’t have a 24 hour flight ahead of me with no problems. The staff was very rude, and unprofessional. By the time I got to Houston, I had another 4 hour layover. Checked in to one of their Club Lounges at my expense. Long story short, I arrived to my destination a day later. After I returned home, I filled a complaint telling my experience, and looking for some sort of reimbursement for my time and expenses for the trip there. I received an immediate email in return stating someone would reach out to me in 21 - 28 days. No later than 6 weeks. I got a response in less than 24 hours saying all they can do is give me a $100 voucher/certificate that expires in 1 year to go towards my next flight. I was blown away. My ticket was $2,900. I felt like they intentionally insulted me to get under my skin. I won’t lie. I will fly again with them locally. Because I have a lot of air miles. But after that’s gone. I’ll never spend another penny with United in this lifetime. And that’s my advice to everyone. Don’t just take my word for it. Read the rest of the reviews. United has downgraded to the worst airline (I’ve ever been on anyway). But still charging elite prices.",-1

You make customers jump through so many hoops by needing to download your app to putting a cc on file in order to pay for WIFI and Drinks then do not offer those options when your passengers have boarded. I wasted hours on the phone with customer service in order to make sure I could be ready and then am told after were in the air that cannot purchase drink they have modified the menu. I have had a long trip driving and traveling for work I enjoy having a beer on flight it's about the only chance I have time for one. It was basically the last straw after everything.,-1
2023-12-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Rome via Newark,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,I should be compensated,True,"  My wife and I booked our bucket list trip to Italy through United via their Star Alliance partner, Air Canada. The nightmare started on September 25, in Montreal, when boarding started, but was never completed. 450 passengers were told that there was a delay because the Air Canada airline baggage personnel crashed the luggage lift into the cargo door. Passengers deplaned and were told there was a one-hour delay. We were then told there was a two-hour delay. Delay after delay. We were strung along until 1:30 am on 9/26/23 when the airline finally admitted the plane would not leave until noon the next day. Vouchers were offered for hotels and food. We were made to pick up luggage and go through customs again and then check our bags again, all 450 people! Then we had to get in line for the vouchers. This took a lot of time and we were exhausted. The line moved slowly and when the service desk was in site there was one Air Canada attendant working. Meanwhile there were 6 or 7 other attendants at the service desk helping passengers for flights the next day and none stepped in to help the passengers that had been up all night! When we finally reached the front of the line (at 4:30 in the morning!), we were told there were no vouchers left! We returned to the gate and slept on very uncomfortable benches as airline transport vehicles beeped and announcements rang out all night. We received $30 for food. We spent $12 of that on toothbrush kits and had to spend $64 for a meal out of our own money. The flight left at noon the next day and arrived at 2 AM in Rome. The original flight was to arrive at 9:30 AM in daylight when the trains were running in Rome. We were supposed to catch a train to Florence but trains do not operate at 2:00 am. We spent our second night trying to sleep at the train station in the company of pigeons and other passengers in the same boat. We took the first available train in the morning to Florence but arrived 30 minutes too late for our first scheduled tour of “David and Accademia”. We had already paid $73.88 for this in advance so not only did we lose our chance to see “David and Accademia”, we lost our money We ended up missing our first two nights stay in the hotel we booked in Rome. We were told the rooms were canceled because we were a “no show” but yet we still had to pay for them even though we called our hotel several times to report our delays. It was a very stressful time! I reached out to both Air Canada and United.  They claim the flight was cancelled due to a safety-related reason and it is ineligible for compensation. It was a safety related issue but the issue it was caused by United/Air Canada’s negligence. An employee ran his luggage loading forklift into the airplane and caused the door not to be airtight. Since the airline caused the problem due to their incompetence, I should be compensated for the misery we were put through.",-1
2023-12-21,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Newark,2.0,,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5,“cabin crew were very welcoming”,True," When we arrived at the bag drop at Los Angeles we were greeted with United Airlines rudest employee. She had a face mask on and simply pointed at our bags. I then initiated communication with her and she managed to communicate back that our bags did not have tags. I then agreed with her and explained that is why we were attempting to reach the the counters. We were then ordered to do self check in, which we worked out to do. When we finally reached the counter the girls there were chatting but turned their attention to us immediately and were very welcoming. I heard an altercation between United’s employee and another customer and then spoke to a supervisor about her who explained that she was feeling under the weather. Moving on Boarding was efficient, cabin crew looked very smartly dressed & were very welcoming. We were late leaving but arrived 20 mins early. We weren’t given any food as this was not part of our fare and we had dinner in the lounge earlier anyway. The seats were adequate for a 3.5 hour flight but I would dread sitting in these for a flight to Asia, Europe or Australia - the same type of seat for a domestic shorthaul. No headphones were provided & we didn’t have our own so unfortunately we had no inflight entertainment for this flight. Our bags arrived at the belt before us & were taken to a storage area for us until we were ready. (We had breakfast in the lounge) I didn’t ask for them to do this but appreciated it. Overall, I would recommend United.",1

We boarded around 3AM, didn’t take off till almost 4AM, United said it was due to “Air traffic Controller problems” we got no meal vouchers, no compensation, and barely an explanation. When we landed, I had about 5 minutes to make my connection to Syracuse, I didn’t make it and the door was closed by the time I ran to the gate, went to the customer service desk and they were extremely rude, couldn’t get on another flight for hours, (again no compensation) and keep in mind I’m a highschooler kid just trying to see my cousins in Las Vegas.",-1

I simply want to recognize the outstanding professional assistance delivered by two kind flight attendants Lyndsey & Leanne to my mother with special needs.

She was wonderful, cheery and had the best attitude of any flight attendant I had over a long period of time. She is great and deserves a pay rise. We even talked about our dogs, hope hers is his ok.

She found a doctor on board, provided me with all the help I needed and arranged for me to be seen when I got off the plane. In the airport, everyone who helped me was wonderful.

Absolutely horrible experience. First time flying United Airlines and definitely the last, we payed extra to fly out for a funeral, first class for the elderly family members to be comfortable in flight.

2023-11-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Gulfport,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1, Highly don’t recommend,False,"  This airline will leave you stranded. Flew out of Seattle, the pilot chilled on the runway for an hour. Just sat due to fog and “low visibility”. Once the plane finally got to flying, we landed, majority of folks missed their connecting flights. But by the way United Airlines doesn’t care because they don’t cover delays due to the weather. So then I try to get on the next flight to GPT. They take my luggage but tell me they have no room for me on the plane so now I no longer have my luggage. Then I try to wait for another plane, it won’t take me home but it will take me to the neighboring state. They wouldn’t cover a hotel for me. Again because they could care less about their little weather delays. Three flights later, I end up in the neighboring state from where I live. I’ve been traveling since 3 am and now it’s 1 am. Some stranger gave me a ride to GPT so I can finally get my car from the airport. United Airlines is rough in these streets. Highly don’t recommend. Do not fly with them. People love United because they “offer free wifi inflight”. The WiFi hardly works and it’s not worth the trouble this airline will cause you and your traveling families.",-1
2023-11-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Sao Paulo via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,“they seemed not to care”,True," I purchased tickets for my family directly from the United website. We were travelling from Ottawa to Sao Paulo with a stop in Washington. Everything was going smoothly until we took off from Washington. After flying for about an hour, the pilot informed us that the airplane was leaking oil, and we had to return to Washington. While I understand it was a safety measure, the nightmare began when we landed after flying for another two hours to reduce fuel. The passengers formed a long line in front of customer service, and the attendants tried to rebook each passenger on another flight to Sao Paulo one by one. No supervisor was present to give us more information, and each passenger took at least an hour to be rebooked. I waited in line for over 3 hours with my two kids. They were stressed and tired and had to sleep on the airport floor while I was waiting in line. When my turn finally arrived, the attendant found three other flights to Sao Paulo. We had to rush to get to the first flight to Cleveland, then to Chicago, and after waiting another 10 hours in the Chicago airport, we finally flew to Sao Paulo. My kids and I spent two days without a shower and proper sleep. United gave us a voucher of $15 each, but it was not enough to buy appropriate food. I had to spend a lot of money to buy food for me and my kids. I felt humiliated, and we travelled for a short vacation in Brazil. My kids were excited to spend one week with their grandparents, but United made our vacation a nightmare. After a few complaint emails, they offered me a $200 voucher, but I don't want it because I will never travel with this airline company again. Despite this, they seemed not to care, so I opened a claim with the Canadian Transportation Agency.",-1
2023-11-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Winnipeg via Toronto,1.0,,1.0,,,5.0,1,they need to better communicate,True,"  I booked my flight through United Airlines to Winnipeg. United booked the ticket with wheel chair services and a personal oxygen concentrator (POC) requirement. United specified using Air Canada as the carrier. This is where the interruption of service occurred. I checked in at 0600 for a 0930 Departure. The gate agent had no indication of the wheelchair requirement and I was utilizing my POC. I was boarded and took my seat approximately 15 minutes prior to closing the door a ground agent came aboard and removed me from the aircraft. The reason was all though the POC was authorized the pilot said it wasn't on his manifest and wanted me removed from the flight. The ground agent showed him where it had been manifested on the original reservation, to which the pilot decided because it wasn't on the Air Canada manifest he would not permit it on his aircraft, even though he stated he new it was an authorized piece of medical equipment. The gate agent, who were helpful, could book me on the next flight, which was at 1705. Unfortunately this did not allow me to meet the reason the flight was booked so I had to cancel the travel. If United is going to utilize Air Canada as a partner they need to better communicate and honor each others request for services instead of removing people from flights based on pilot inputs strictly based on personnel desires when it was shown to them that the POC was in fact part of the initial reservation.",-1
2023-11-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Dubai,,,,,,,1,ended up canceling the booking,True,"  I booked a business class round trip at the United website but when I saw that I couldn’t check in, I called the customer service number twice. Both times, they stated that my reservation did not go through even though I had a confirmation number. Then they asked how much I paid, claimed the value was too low, they can rebook me - asked why I couldn’t fly premium economy instead and quoted a price that was more than what I booked the flight for and said the price for business class went up double. The customer service representative was rude and kept telling me I paid too little even though I had picked the price that was on the website. Their explanation was that there are other passengers who may have selected the seats at the same time. It felt like they did it purposely to get me to pay double or fly premium economy at $9500.00. I ended up canceling the booking.",-1

2023-11-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Washington,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,“economy class seat TVs were nonfunctional”,True," Boarding started for UA991 BA283B on time Sunday November 19th 2023 at 10:55am and ended on time at 11:30am from Barcelona. Flight ended and take off went on time without any issues on time around 11:45am. My wife and I were sitting in 54L and 54K. Flight security demonstration had to be done live because all of the economy class seat TVs were nonfunctional. This was an inconvenience to not have function tv but at least the flight departed on time. About an hour into the flight the captain came over the system to say they had attempted all their trouble shooting suggestions but had a malfunction that was not resolving so they were going to turn around. This was not ideal but hope was to get back to fix concern or reschedule the passengers. About an hour later it was said that we were unable to land because the plane had too much fuel so we had to continue to fly until it was safe to land. Eventually we landed but it was as if there was no true communication with the airport as they didn’t know where to put us when we finally landed. They ended up taking us to a cargo area and because of this it took about an hour from landing until the maintenance crew could get to that side of the airport. Eventually which seemed obvious to me they eventually made us aware the repair would take so long that the flight crew would not have hours to fly even it it was fixed. This seems very obvious to me considering it was a 9 hour flight time and over 3 hours were wasted before maintenance even arrived to look at it. At this point they had no idea how to get us off the plane because we were not at a gate and they did not have authorized drivers to drive a bus to the cargo area. Eventually they stated they had 1 driver with the certifications to cross all those areas to get to us. They then kept acting as though the entire plane would get on bus 1, then on bus two when it returned, then with bus 3, and eventually I was offboarded on bus 5 over an hour since the first bus took the front of the plane. Concerning part is we did not pass over any run ways and several emergency personnel were driving the same route as us with out plane sitting next to empty passenger buses. The flight crew did not offer anyone water or food during this entire process 5 hours between boarding and offboarding with mainly elderly from many returning cruise liners. Even though the staff stated we had been rebooked on the flight for the same plane the following day with them we had no confirmations. When they pointed us to the person who had those answers they shrugged their shoulders and stated no idea but bags should be at #6 baggage claim. When we got there the entire plane was still there because no one had their luggage yet. The same barriers to get us offboarded also had them stumped on how to get our bags back to the main terminal. We waited another hour for bags to begin to come. The staff near the baggage claim kept saying everyone would be shuttled to a hotel and brought back in the AM for the rescheduled 9am flight but had no details of how any of it would happen. We had to ease drop to realize some passengers were told to stand in line to put their name in for a hotel but no one had announced this.",-1
2023-11-21,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Pittsburgh,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,1,"5 months since I applied for reimbursement"" ",True,"  Last summer, my flight from Belgrade to Pittsburgh was overbooked and I had to stay in Vienna one day. Austrian was happy to reimburse me immediately for my inconvenience to solve their problem and that worked out OK. However, for my connection from Newark to Pittsburgh I had to rent a car. Service desk told me that I'd be reimbursed and gave me Lufthansa phone number to ask for it. After endless delays and documents requests, Lufthansa agreed that I am owed reimbursement and asked me to provide my bank info to deposit it. After additional confusion I provided my bank info and never heard from them again. They do not respond to my e-mails anymore, on the phone they refuse to provide any solution or let me talk to anybody who could address my problem. I understand that summer travelling can get complicated and I patiently worked with them to complete my trip. However, I do not understand how they can promise to reimburse me, take my bank account info and completely ignore me after that. I think they delay what they are supposed to do hoping that the customer would forget or give up. Shameful! It has been 5 months since I applied for reimbursement. This is not acceptable from a reputable or any company. MilagePlus partners are definitely to be avoided.",-1

At first, we didn’t know how to check-in and we asked the staffs at the check-in station downstairs, the lady yelled at my husband that “ what?”. I’m sorry but I have to say that was uneducated. Was that the attitude you guys trained to serve the customers? At least you say “excuse me”, but she didn’t. And secondly, the guy at baggage claim was so rude, he took our luggage and he used his index finger to call my husband, and he said “your ID?”. Hey, we are not criminals, why did you talk to us like that? This is a big airline, but some of staff have bad attitudes, I think they need to training again. But finally, we got help from a lady upstairs, she was so nice and really helpful, we were appreciated that. And I think this is the first as last time with United Airlines.",-1
2023-11-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,flight attendant kicked us off the plane,True,"  A flight attendant kicked us off the plane yesterday because we asked where our seat is! Yesterday (11/13) we were supposed to fly back home from MCO to IAD, the flight was supposed to depart at 4:25 PM (flight UA 2065) but due to an unfair and humiliating harassment caused by a flight attendant name Nathalie Gravenstij, we got kicked out off the plane. Here is what happened: They announced that the plane is experiencing some cargo issues so the luggage will be on a different flight, we said sure. Time comes for boarding the passengers, my husband, two young children and myself went on the plane and found out they have changed the seat numbers for several people. My husband politely asked the flight attendant where he should sit. We immediately heard the flight attendant screaming at him saying you do not talk to me like that, I will throw you off the plane. We were shocked and several other passengers asked that flight attendant why she would behave like that and she grabbed the boarding pass out of that other lady who was confronting her! Then the flight attendant asked my husband (rudely) to just sit down on that empty seat. He did and asked where my little daughter should sit. The flight attendant raised her voice and started screaming at my husband in front of our kids. She said ""That's it! I am kicking you all off of this plane"" then immediately went and grabbed the phone and called the Captain, security person or the ticketing manager (couldn't tell whom she is calling), they came and asked what happened. Another passenger (whom her boarding pass was pulled from her hand by the same flight attendant) testified and said how rude that person was. The security guy asked the Captain and then came back and told us the Captain wants no trouble so you guys should all leave the plane! When we got off, the manager came and apologies, found out the name for that flight attendant and sent us home on the next flight which departed 3 hours later. My kids were traumatized and started crying. The management insisted that we file an official complaint.",-1

She noticed my ticket that I was boarded on the back of the plane with a middle seat. She did not manage to change at the first glance of a full flight but she kept a reminder to change whenever a better seat is available. In the end, a better seat in front was available and she immediately changed for me. That's top class service.",1
2023-11-12,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,5.0,2,“This kind of behavior is unacceptable”,True," I had mistakenly pressed the call button in the toilet when I was searching for the flush button. The flight attendant, an Indian male (I'm too) rushed and knocked on the door to assure that I was okay. I told him that it was my mistake and apologized for it. He gave me the look and went back without saying anything. However, when it was time to serve beverages, he came to the economy aisle with the cart and served row by row, but specifically skipped mine and served the rows in the front and back of my row. I had the aisle seat and the two passengers next to me were asleep. I was making movements, had the tray table open and there was no way that he could have assumed that I was asleep. I'm sure that he penalized me for that mistake. I later asked for a flight attendant through the touchscreen and a female attendant showed up after half an hour. She told me it was her break and couldn't come sooner and served me tea. This kind of behavior by that flight attendant is unacceptable and unprofessional as although I made a genuine mistake, his action was deliberate. Other than that everything was normal in the economy class. My screen was slightly damaged and had flickering lines but it wasn't a hindrance to the operation of the touchscreen or the watching experience. Movie, TV and documentary options were decent. The seats were comfortable and flight only took only 14 hours, despite the 15 hours listed time. UA816 from Newark departed on time and reached Delhi around 10 AM the next morning. The morning arrival time is very convenient and makes it much easier on the person who is coming to pick you up, rather than a late night arrival time. There were several immigration counters and it took only a minute or two to get the stamping done for Indian passport holders. The baggage belt already had bags from my flight and it was surprising to see that checked bags were already moving on the conveyor. I had to wait less than 10 minutes till my bag arrived on the belt. I have generally found that the quality of in-cabin service is better for Delta and American than United and such behavior makes me avoid United if there are other options.",-1
2023-11-11,0.2,Business,Premium Economy,Phoenix to Houston via Midland,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,2,United has really started to go downhill,True,"  On average I fly between 60,000 to 80,000 flight miles per year for business. Normally I would give a good review but United has really started to go downhill. I have never seen a company have so many issues. Over the last year every other flight is delayed at a minimum of an hour. It's absolutely ridiculous to have that many issues. The flight teams are constantly late and it seems that the maintenance problems are constant. Today, i have been delayed for eight hours. United had a earlier flight but they wanted additional money to be moved to an earlier flight and when i decided to spend extra money the person i was talking to on the ""help line"" hung up on me. I would think that the $10,000 dollars I spend a year would be enough. If United doesn't figure out their issues I will be moving to another carrier.",-1
2023-11-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Lima,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly with them again,False,"  My connecting flight (UA886) from Newark to Lima, Peru on Sept 8 was scheduled to take of at 2.40pm but was delayed due to bad weather. Once the weather improved we were given clearance for take off, but a series of further delays caused by a blocked lavatory, and the aircraft being overloaded resulting in cargo having to be downloaded, and caterers having to board to change the food due to the long delays. After eight hours on the aircraft we were informed that the flight was cancelled because the pilots would be over the allowable time. We were told to collect our bags and go home or reschedule. The next available flight was two days later on 10 Sept. I had to book two nights in a hotel at a cost of over USD500 plus additional taxi and meals costs. I also lost two nights bookings in hotels in Lima that I had already paid for (approx USD200). United Airlines refused to pay for hotels at the time and have refused to compensate me since other than offering a $150 flight voucher which I declined. My advice would be to avoid using United Airlines because they will simply wash their hands of any responsibility if your flight is cancelled. I will never fly with them again, they are incompetent and don't seem to care too much about their customers. Be warned.",-1
2023-11-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Frankfurt,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Stay away from United Airlines,True,"  Stay away from United Airlines, especially as a European, because if your flight there in the USA is cancelled, you get nothing (only the statement that European legislation does not apply and that we as Europeans have no recourse to compensation) even if they promise to refund your hotel and transfer. We experienced it: on 29/7 waiting for 3 hours and then checking in for the flight, then waiting for 1 hour without drinks or anything hostage to take off only to be told that the flight is cancelled because the crew will go into overtime. Then chaos, hours of waiting at the counter where things are not moving forward (it was already midnight!); You get a text message that you can book a hotel on your own initiative but then when you claim it via emails, forms through their website you get nothing. Then when you threaten to sue after several months, you are told they will only pay $200. Even though we booked a Quinta hotel which was not expensive, for 3 people you don't get by with $200. They also did not provide breakfast and food on 30/7 (because flight was rebooked then). We were on a domestic flight at 10:30am and got nothing to eat! The flight did not arrive until 5 pm. So all this time we got nothing! If we asked anything of the stewards we were laughed at as it were.  When we checked in on 30/7 at the desk to leave, when we checked in our suitcases they told us that we were not on the passenger list and had to go to another customer service line. There we waited for an hour, we were nope with nerves because our flight was about to leave. When it was our turn at customer service, I asked us deadpan why we had queued, that we should go through security immediately and check in at the gate. And the story doesn't end there either. We asked in both SFO and Chicago if our valises (which we had to leave behind at the airport on 29/7) would follow us: no problem they all said. You guessed it, on arrival in Brussels, no suitcases and so again we had to queue for an hour to make a claim. We were mentally and physically exhausted! And you have to know that our son has a disability (we gave the disability card as an evidence but no understanding whatsoever during our trip. Only after 10 days finally had our suitcases back.",-1

2023-10-28,0.2,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Sacramento to Medford,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,United is still a terrible airline,False,"  I had not flown on a United flight for about six years due to several flights that were horrible, and where some United personnel were very rude. A family member bought me a ticket on United for October 23, 2023, and I was hoping United had gotten better; unfortunately United is still a terrible airline. I upgraded and paid additional for premium seating which means nothing; no complimentary drink or early boarding. I normally fly Alaska and Delta which treat persons paying additional for premium class much better. Then to top it off, I almost missed my connecting flight because the first flight left late (OK, I understand that happens & is at times unavoidable) but after running to catch the connecting flight, I was looking forward to relaxing with a glass of wine. Shortly after take off, the pilot announces there would be no service due to a possible bumpy ride. I am in the row right behind first class, and the flight attendant serving first class never sat down, until the plane was descending to land. So, what the pilot said was a crock and then I noticed that there was only one flight attendant for economy and premier class seats which obviously was not enough to service a plane that size. Glad I can fly Delta and Alaska and never again United!",-1
2023-10-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Austin,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst ever customer service,True,"  The worst airline I've flown and the worst ever customer service. I had to change my return flight date for various reasons and I talked to some customer representatives. The first guy was very helpful and I could tell that he really did want to help me. He sounded empathetic and also tried to talk to his supervisor to give me a discount on the fare difference or not charge a difference at all. However, this supervisor was a stupid person who offered to change my flight to an earlier date for a price difference of a thousand dollars. I mean the original round trip cost me $320 with two bags checked in and they wanted me to pay $1036 to change my flight by two days. Anyways I am very dissatisfied and won't be travelling in United Airlines anytime in the future. Other attempts didn't help either. What a waste of money.",-1
2023-10-27,1.0,Business,Premium Economy,Philadelphia to Houston,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5,love United’s premium economy seats,True,"  This was the first flight of the day out of Philadelphia, we left on time and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Once in the air, the inflight crew provided friendly and efficient service. I really love United’s premium economy seats as they give you extra legroom and on my flight the middle seat in my row was empty and that made for a much more comfortable flying experience. Since the flight was early in the morning I purchased the blueberry with oats which is my favorite. United has gone cashless so don’t forget to add your credit card to their app prior to boarding. The plane was over 20 years old however it had been refitted with United‘s new cabin and it was very well kept. This airplane offered Wi-Fi from the time we boarded to the time we deplaned and it was free as part of my cell phone provider’s plan. United delivers a consistent product with safety, dependability and efficiency. Fan for life!",1
2023-10-26,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Indianapolis,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1,never provided a good flight,False,"  I have never had a good experience with United and this was the absolute bottom of the barrel of flights. Taking a redeye from SFO to IND, I fell asleep during the flight. Being on the aisle, my left leg crept into the aisle a little bit. The grouchy lady slams the cart into my leg and was in my face yelling at me for having my leg in the aisle. I obviously exclaimed when it happened due to the pain and surprise of the whole thing. I explained to her that I was not leaving my leg out there on purpose and she gets in my face and tells me that it is not her responsibility to make sure that my leg is not in the way. I put my headphones back in and she keeps going at me. I told her that I did not want to talk about it anymore and she calls for another employee to tell her that I am getting in her face and she wants to call the captain to have the plane landed and have me thrown off. She further claims that I am ""up in her face"" mind you, I am in my seat this whole time with my earbud back in with my seatbelt on and not saying a word. The people that witnessed this next to me were watching the whole thing and, once we were safe from this tyrant's earshot, were stating how she blew it way out of proportion.  Absolutely pathetic that this is acceptable behavior and United has never provided a good flight. Overpriced and totally not worth it.",-1
2023-10-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Yap, FSM to Guam, USA",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,“Terrible customer service“,True," I purchased a fully refundable flight and I had to cancel it. I was entitled to a refund of 1.2k USD. At the moment of the cancellation, a bug in United's system caused my refund to be issued in form of travel voucher, rather than being credited back on my card. The issue has not been fixed yet after - Three months of discussions - More than 5 hours of calls on skype (I summed them manually, it's precisely 5 hours and 26 minutes) - Countless confusing / contradicting emails from United's customer service I ruined so many of my working days at the phone, I ruined my mood, and I think I won't see my money back. The amount is not small, and I am not going to use their travel voucher because I don't live in the US. The worst company I had to deal with, and I fly a lot. Terrible customer service, and their system is full of bugs, even the online check in did not work.",-1
2023-10-25,1.0,Business,Premium Economy,Houston to Philadelphia,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,"“Caring, safe and efficient”",True," This was a perfect flight on a brand new Boeing 737 Max 800, still smelled like new. We left on time and arrived 20mins ahead of schedule. Good weather contributed for a smooth ride with no turbulence at all. The inflight crew was polite and efficient during boarding, service and deplaning. United’s app is solid as it keeps you informed every step of the way, the economy plus seats offer extra legroom and since the aircraft was not full, the middle seat in my row was empty and it made for a much more comfortable experience. Loved the continuous WiFi onboard, free thru my cellphone carrier. Since this was a morning flight I ordered the oats with blueberries (served cold) loved it, since United has gone cashless don’t forget to upload a credit card to the United app for purchasing snacks onboard. I also love the Bluetooth screens on every seat, they offered earbuds but you can just pair your own. Caring, safe and efficient! Thank you United! Fan for life!",1

The crew, food and entertainment were excellent throughout both sectors. Nothing was too much trouble for the crew. They were attentive and courteous at all times. The seat and bedding is very good too. Check in and security at both airports was a breeze and the Polaris lounge at SFO was a very good experience.",1

No in flight entertainment. No seat back tv screens. Wifi was $8 + unexpected charges. Boarding order by section was ignored so no one got to put their luggage above their rows except people that were allowed to board 4 sections early. I felt the passenger's behind me knees in my back the entire journey. Honestly, never choose United over Delta. I am paying $600 for a greyhound bus experience.",-1

First off, the guy next to me wanted to move to another seat since he and I were both wide shouldered and there was an open seat with an empty center. When they came back, once door was closed, they had looked him up and his status and offered an upgrade for a fee that he happily took. Then Dustin was so patient with this couple behind me. I’m not sure what was wrong but you could tell that they were exceptionally needy and I personally wouldn’t have had the patience. This was the motivation for writing the review as Dustin and the other gentleman working out section were going above and beyond and there was no way this couple would leave a good review.

2023-10-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Wayne to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,We do not want to fly United again,True,"  The original flight was changed, and we were not notified until we arrived at the airport at 5:00 a.m. The agent at the airport and on the phone verified that no notification was sent to us from the United system. I was told it was a system glitch. Not acceptable! Then we had to come back for the next flight, and the plane had a mechanical error and had to turn around. Then we were told the plane was in the air and was lied to as it was not! Due to this, we missed our connecting flight. We lost an entire day of our vacation that we paid for and lost time with our family, who took off work to see us! We were originally supposed to be in Tampa around 11 a.m. but did not arrive until midnight! We do not want to fly United again. It has been a horrible process, and getting in contact with customer service has been worse. On top of that, when we sat down, I pulled my seat tray, and there was old gum on it!",-1
2023-10-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Washington,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,“flight was delayed seven hours”,True," My flight was delayed seven hours going out of O’Hare. They are saying they don’t provide compensation, but the first 45 minutes was because the stewardess was late. Had the stewardess not been late we would not have been affected by weather. The customer service line was very very long probably about three hours long. They did not rebook me, I stayed on the line all night long with customer service. I had to pay for hotel. I had to rebook myself on Ethiopian airlines. When Ethiopian flight flight was delayed, they provided me with three meals, a boarding pass for an alternate flight and a hotel room. When I arrived in DC, I spent two hours waiting for my bag, which never appeared, I went back the next morning. It was still not there, and they said it was behind security with 5000 other bags. They told me I would have to wait till Cape Town. It was not in Cape Town and I did not receive the bag until six days after I left Chicago. I am asked for some compensation for my inconvenience and expense and they refused. Their international division is horrible.",-1

Were were twice told it would be 10 to 15 minutes, then no further communication for another 20 minutes. There was supposedly a plane at our gate. They need to have an alternative, such as stairs. To unload passengers in such circumstances. Holding passengers captive with no communication is unacceptable. United Airlines has done this to me the last 2 times I flew with them and are generally horrible any time I have had to fly with them.",-1
2023-10-19,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Palm Springs to Savannah via Denver,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2,expect and am entitled to polite service,False,"  This was only our second trip with United, the first being a short LAX-PSP flight home after a European trip. All of our flights were on time, and I appreciated the text updates regarding our flight times, gate and boarding prompts. What I did NOT appreciate was a very simple thing. In order to buy a drink or food during a flight, it is required to input a credit card during online checkin. Which we did, and worked fine for 3 legs of our trip. Apparently, we fell off the system, and the flight attendant on the last leg was simply nasty about helping us with input. We finally gave up, and she literally threw the drinks at us, while saying “I’ll give you these, but you should know how to do this”. When I am spending $1200.00 dollars for a flight in Economy Plus just to obtain a decent seat, I expect and am entitled to polite service.",-1
2023-10-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Ottawa to New York,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,incredibly frustrating and disappointing,True,"   My worst flight experience was with United Airlines on July 21st. I had booked a flight from Ottawa to New Jersey because I had a business meeting scheduled for 12 noon. The flight was scheduled for 6 a.m., and I expected to arrive at 7 a.m., thinking I had enough time in case of any flight delays. However, my flight was delayed for 7 hours, and it didn't take off until 1:15 p.m. and the airport attendants informed us this was due to a fire extinguisher functionality. By the time I arrived at my destination, my business meeting had already concluded, rendering the entire trip pointless. Upon returning home, I promptly filed a compensation complaint. The response time to my complaint was disappointingly slow. I eventually received an email offering two options: a cash compensation of $600 or a travel voucher worth $1000, valid for 12 months. Since I had no immediate travel plans for the next year and the voucher would expire within 12 months, I opted for the cash compensation. I provided my address as requested for a check to be mailed out. To my surprise, I received a response from United Airlines stating that I did not qualify for the compensation option I had chosen. Instead, they offered a travel voucher worth $200. United Airlines claimed the flight was disrupted due to safety reasons, hence I do not qualify for compensation. This experience was incredibly frustrating and disappointing and I will not advise anyone to travel with United Airlines if you have an important appointment the same day.",-1

Not so much of the agents in Newark who were terrible and rude, no professionalism and customer service was shown. I was impressed at the agents in Jamaica especially one employee, Sashauna, super professional. She remained professional and calm and had the patience with me. I definitely recommend anybody to go to her for help she can multitask and super helpful. That’s the type of customer service we need in Newark we need more people like her.",1

They gave us a paper and promised to pay for your hotel a maximum of USD$200 and plus $30 for 2 meals. My flight was delayed for 30 hours, so it should be 4 meals. (200+60) . After a couple of months of complaints and a lot of submissions. They replied they would credit me back $200 for my next flight. It's absolutely ridiculous! I just feel like I got robbed by them. They promised to reimburse me for the USD check instead of the certificate. They just keep telling lies to customers and I will never trust this airline. They feel they are so powerful, they do not refund you, and nothing you can do. Just bullying and lying to customers again and again. Taking this airline will make you spend a lot of extra time and money. I don't want their certificate, I just want my money back and never want to take this airline again!",-1
2023-10-10,0.9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Chicago,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,"all in all most enjoyable"" ",False,"  A premium economy ticket comes with priority check in/bag drop and in Chicago priority access to security which saves time Especially when O’Hare is so busy. Boarding is organised and the staff are friendly and helpful. I am on the larger side so the premium economy seat is very comfortable, behind wider and with more leg room and the seat belt is longer so is more comfortable, however the fold out tray table could extend out a little further as it was just a little tight. The tv screen is of a good size and was easy to use and the supplied headphones were of good quality. The main fault with the seat is access to the power sockets and the headphone socket as they are under a flap in the armrest and behind you making it very hard to plug something in whilst seated. The seat is very comfortable and although limited the recline made it easy to sleep.The amenity set is pretty standard and you get a nice soft pillow and blanket. Being an early flight we were first served breakfast, later a snack and finally a hot lunch which were all pretty tasty, there were also hot and cold drinks at various intervals as well as water handed out. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient (although mainly older than usual). The flight was on time and all in all most enjoyable.",1
2023-10-10,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Minneapolis via Chicago,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1,they denied my refund request,True,"   I'd never recommend flying with United. My most recent experience includes working with a United Agent to cancel a leg of my flight itinerary where I received explicit confirmation from them that I would receive a full refund on that leg of the flight. The disclaimer is that I would have to submit the official refund after I finished the return leg of my flight 10 days later. That's fine and I went forward with things. Fast forward to today where it has been 3 weeks since submitting the official refund request with screenshots of my previous conversation with the United agent, they denied my refund request and instead gave me a $150 credit, which is 25% of the value that I was promised. So highly disappointed knowing that United is okay with lying to customers. I would never have cancelled my flight had I known that I wasn't going to get reimbursed.",-1

The choice of the main meal was either vegetarian or halal meat. The passengers on the flight seemed to be regular Americans/Europeans who are used to eating regular meals. The mystery is why United Airlines caters to minorities of passengers who may not be even on the plane? Added deception: halal meal was not offered as halal but as regular chicken meal, ""halal"" was written on the label. I ended up choosing vegetarian.",-1
2023-10-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Calgary via Denver,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,No idea how to provide customer service,False,  Ground staff in Denver are rude and abrupt. No idea how to provide customer service in this position. I found the staff in Calgary just as bad. Having worked for a major Australian airline I would highly recommend retraining the staff that are the face of your organisation. Having read previous reviews it would appear this is long overdue. Hope never having to be in a position where my family and I have to use this airline again.,-1
2023-10-03,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Toronto via San Francisco,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,The flight was simply perfect,True," I must confess after reading many of the comments here I thought concerned for buying a ticket on United to fly to SYD Australia from YYZ (Toronto) via SFO (San Francisco) to attend a conference. But the experience on United ended up being extremely good. From the moment I checked in online I was kept informed of my flights, luggage updates through automatic SMS service. My flight was combined between Air Canada from Toronto to San Francisco on Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A321 Neo from San Francisco to Toronto and United on B777-300 from San Francisco to Sydney and back. In Toronto at the beginning of my trip, I was not able to choose seats on United for some reason which was a bit disappointing. I approached United staff at Toronto as well, and they said they cannot help me but the staff in San Francisco can once I arrive there. This was correct, as upon landing in SFO I found United customer service counter and they assisted me with changing my seat which was my desired option. I was very happy with that. Upon boarding, headsets were given, and we pushed back slightly before schedule. The flight was simply perfect. The food was very tasty (unlike many negative comments I saw here) and on SFO- SYD flight we got drinks with a dinner (butter chicken and some delicious red wine), snack in the middle of the flight and a hot breakfast (I took a waffle) which was also delicious. The crew offered water and drinks numerous times during the flight, they also cleared the cabin again and again, so I never had any issues with garbage being not collected. The drinks were also available in the galley and pretzel snacks. The crew (two very sweet guys) were very chatty, friendly, and kind. Toilets were clean throughout the flight as well. Upon landing in Sydney, we reached the gate without issues, disembarked and the luggage was there shortly after. On the way back, it was a daily flight, the flight left the gate ahead of time as well, the crew were super friendly during boarding and gave alcoholic wipes for hand hygiene and headsets. Upon take-off, snacks and drinks were offered first, followed by lunch (creamy chicken with rice) and upon clearance they offered water bottles to all passengers. During the flight the crew were often seen in the cabin helping out and chatting with passengers. The rest of flight went really well as well. Entertainment was great both ways and free Whatsapp service was very much appreciated by me. All together, no complaints at all, United was extremely good for what I was expected and treated me very very well on my way to Australia and back. And the crew were stunning. I will 100% fly United again. Thank you United Airlines for such an amazing experience. (BS)",1
2023-10-03,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark via Buffalo,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2,Her attitude felt dismissive,False,"  I recently had a flight with United Airlines departing from IAH to Newark, and I wanted to share my experience regarding one of the flight attendants. The flight attendant who was responsible for distributing cookies and snack boxes shortly after takeoff, left a lot to be desired in terms of customer service. Her demeanor throughout the interaction was quite unpleasant. When offering passengers the choice between a cookie or a snack box, including myself, she came across as curt and impatient. It became even more problematic when passengers had additional questions or hesitated in making their choice; she responded with visible annoyance, leaving passengers feeling embarrassed and disrespected. I understand that everyone has off days, and I am generally forgiving, but this incident crossed the line in terms of acceptable customer service. Flight attendants play a crucial role in ensuring a comfortable and safe flight experience for passengers, and their demeanor should reflect the airline's commitment to service excellence. Her attitude felt dismissive and, at times, borderline hostile. It raises the question of whether the airline thoroughly screens and trains its staff. I hope that United Airlines takes this feedback seriously and considers addressing this issue. It is instances like this that could make passengers like me hesitate to choose United Airlines in the future. I believe that some form of improvement plan or training would be beneficial for this flight attendant, ensuring a more positive experience for all passengers.",-1

What is the deal with flight attendants? They have numerous staff seats however they decided to block off 6 passenger seats on a full capacity flight for their own use. I didn't realise that my $1300 ticket paid for their seats. One of the crew members decided to use those seats to take a nap on our 9 hour flight. They say you can't move seat because it's calculated on your weight and that's how the plane is balanced. They have no idea what customer service is.  Makes me never want to fly again. Dreadful experience!",-1

At the first meal they served I asked for a hot tea. While I was putting a cup in cup holder I bumped a cup on the table and spilt all over the blanket and into my lap, my pants and seat. Immediately I asked a flight attendant for something to wipe and another blanket. She said I'll be back to assist me after she put the cart back. I waited a while, I saw her take a cart away. She never came back to me, so I rang for help then waited, light went off but still no one came, I rang again, still no one came to assist me. I finally stopped one of the flight attendants and asked her for help. I explained what happened and need a another blanket. She told me that they don't carry any spare blanket but she will see if she can find something to help me but that was it. No one ever came back to help me. I was wet and cold for over 10 hours. I've been flying every year for about 20 years using ANA and United. This was worst experience ever.",-1

2023-09-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Berlin via Munich,,,,,,,1,Never will I fly United,True,"  2 hours to get our reservation and another 2 hours to reserve our seats. So much confusion between United vs Lufthansa access to data, who to talk to for what, and fees paid to one airline do not cover the same services on the other airline. After paying for our reservation i received a call saying we need to pay to get seats on our flight even though I had paid for seats. By the time we are done we pay an additional $500 to get seats on the plane. They next want another $250 to allow our baggage to go straight through to our final destination. I paid the $500 and said I would carry my checked bags between segments of the flight and concluded that call. A few moments later, I got a second call saying we got disconnected and was told there was no record of the $500 payment I just made and had a verified email showing my payment. Next thing I know they have wheelchairs reserved for me and my wife which I cancelled. Seats that were reserved and paid for my me were repeatedly being taken away from us even though I had documentation showing they were assigned to us. Finally I got the seats assignments back and now I am told that airline policy is to send bags straight throw to the final destination.  Never will I fly United or segments of a trip supported by United. Its not worth the effort to fly.",-1

2023-09-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Tokyo via Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,This is totally unacceptable procedure,False,"  They stole my money and ticket! This may happen to you as well! Avoid buying tickets from them if you want to avoid disasters. They canceled our return flight without even asking us! I booked my flight to Japan (Tokyo) with the United Airlines website. Their website offers a feature where you can ""check"" to see if there are any passport needs (Visas, approvals, etc.). We checked this for both me and my girlfriend and the website gave us the thumbs up to our trip which was supposed to be the next day. On the day of the flight, the person at the check-in refused to let my South Korean girlfriend in because she did not have an ESTA for entering the United States for our connecting flight. So we quickly sit somewhere and apply for the ESTA. But it gets approved after the gate has been closed. I called United to see if we could move our ticket and they replied saying that I had a ""special"" ticket. Meaning they could not move me to a later flight or offer me a refund. Even then I said fine, my fault, I should have checked. I paid an additional $2.6k for new tickets for a same-day flight with ANA (which were amazing by the way). However, ANA informed me that United may cancel our return flight. So I called them right away (about 1-2hrs after our original flight had taken off) and they said it's too late and they have already canceled the whole trip including our return tickets. I asked why and they said it's ""just an automated system"". I asked for our return tickets to be re-instated and they said I would have to pay them another $2.5k. Absolutely absurd. They basically took my money, their passport check service on their site is not reliable at all, and they canceled my entire trip without anything in return. I stayed on the call with the customer service trying to negotiate something but they did not offer me anything however the supervisor said to try asking for a refund through the site. Which I did and was refused right away. This is totally unacceptable procedure. You need to at least check in with me before canceling my return trip! In total I ended up paying $7k for tickets to Japan and back because of a stupid procedure and the incompetence of their web passport requirements check. Avoid at all costs. You may think this can't happen to you but I thought the same.",-1

She flies frequently on United and always gets a connecting boarding pass. The lady was very unfriendly and rude, refused to give her one, said the line was too long and turned her away, telling her she can get it herself when she gets off the plane in Chicago. There was 4 booths open and only 1 person behind her in line. We went to the next booth and was greeted by a very nice young man named Malik, who printed her pass for her, which took about 2 minutes. We will continue to use United because of Malik and other friendly customer service we've experienced, but no one deserves to be treated the way we were from the other lady, and if I see her there again, I will wait for the next person to check in.",1

Plane kept delaying and delaying for 9 hours. No compensation or even apologies were given. Just voucher to buy snack ($15.00). Then on the way back I needed to change the dates - what I was offered was almost double the price of new ticket. As I was explained by supervisor named Gwen, United don't change Basic Economy ticket to the same. Only for Economy. Ended with buying new ticket for the half price of offered by United - funny, but also United flight. Will definitely try to avoid this company by any means. No wonder they have so many bad reviews.",-1

We tripled checked with their customer service as we do not have the extra money for that. Well guess what they told us too bad, not their policy and they will not reimburse us so we are out over $200.  Worst customer service and airline I have ever dealt with! They should be ashamed",-1

Flight was cancelled due to staffing issues (multiple texts and emails that said due to issues with staff). Waited on hold for over two hours before call dropped and in line at airport for over 3 hours before getting “help.” They didn’t offer a refund and if they had I’d have had no way to book at a reasonable price same day since they’d created an artificially inflated market for tickets by cancelling so many flights and leaving so many people stranded. They ended up putting me on a flight to Detroit which was 4+ hours away from where I paid them to get me without any reimbursement for lodging, rental car etc. That flight was then delayed multiple times. Spent an entire day at the airport waiting to get out and finally made it to Detroit at 3am when I was supposed to be in Traverse City at 2pm the day before. When I asked for a refund they told me my reservation had been fully used because they put me on a flight that was 1/4 the price of the one I booked when I was booking it. Eventually I got a whopping $150 credit that I have no intention of ever using. This all happened on the same day their CEO was flying in his private jet from between airports that they had hundreds of cancelled flights in that day alone (Newark to Denver). Stealing from your customers isn’t ok. If you take their money you need to provide what was paid for, if you can’t you owe them their money back.",-1

I paid for a first class full fare domestic one-way on United. First Class was full, as usual, with the upgraded Mileage Plus passengers, which I don't object to. However, the stewardess serving in First Class was rude, attired in a dirty, rumpled uniform, and served the most disgusting breakfast I have ever seen. It was described as some kind of omelette, but was in fact some kind of yellow slop. The stewardess acted if she was doing us a favour by serving coffee. This is precisely what happens when there is so little competition amongst airlines in the USA. Long gone are the days of the ""Friendly Skies"". This particular class of service on UAL should be described as ""No Class"", and was most certainly not even close to a First Class Service. I would recommend avoiding United Airlines if you can possibly do so; however, don't expect domestic US airlines to be much better. What happened to enthusiastic, courteous, American hospitality? Simply the worst!",-1

Flight was delayed due to a problem on the airlines end. We ended up missing our connecting flight to our final destination, resulting in a complete loss (and rebooking of much more expensive options) of our booked transport and accommodation costing us a whole lot of money and one whole day of our holiday. When contacted was met with resistance followed by a mere 150 dollar credit offer, which would have barely covered a one way trip of the booked transport. This gesture although something, barely constitutes a sorry and feels like a pat on the back I. The scheme of things. Avoid United at all costs!",-1

So that we had them and not get assigned for free in the airport. On Zurich to SFO United agents had us check in our carry ons because our paid for seats had no overhead storage. Because that box was locked and assigned for the crew only! Shame on you UA, selling seats knowing they do not have an overhead storage! And charging extra for that “privilege”. You did not sell them cheaper, we had no idea there will be no storage. During the flight, the passenger ahead of me reclined fast and spilled the water the attendant just provided in a cup, not a bottle! All on my lap. I had to stay soaking wet. UA had no solution to this problem. They shrugged their shoulders and stated exactly that: “not my problem”. On top of everything, all 3 checked in luggage we had with us was lost. UA had clue where they were for days. Athens? Zurich? It was an absolute nightmare to try to contact any of their agents, I was in queue to get a call from them for 4 hours and when they were “connecting” me, they disconnected … and nobody called back. It was the worse experience ever, they were doing a horrible job in all aspects. I suggest they start carrying more about their customers than other… PC issues.

And canceled 4 other flights that I know of at the same time.  Hundreds of other United customers were left waiting for hours, and stranded, I was in line with them.  United didn't even book other available flights on other airlines to replace their canceled flight, they refused to bear that expense, because I was a ""Basic Economy"" flyer.   That has ruined my confidence in being able to use  United again.  Really bad decision, to sacrifice customer's confidence in the airline to satisfy their commitments to paid customers, all for cost cutting.  No other airline was canceling flights at EWR that evening. United is finished, in my eyes. I flew on Delta, and back on United, and had to endure long stops back, originally was a direct flight. United was a really poor experience.",-1

I was there at 9:48 only to find out boarding stopped. No boarding time as in my email, no arrival time was in my email, only 9:57 which was 10 minutes after they closed the doors. Never have I had such little information given in an email, never have I been expected to know information regarding travel that wasn’t readily available in the email, never have I been treated like a fool for misunderstanding departure time vs boarding time, even though boarding time was not updated in the email, I will not book a flight with United knowing what I know now.

I flew from Houston to Toronto flight # UA313, my seat number was 22C. Since my seat row did not have a charging connection and the seat 21D was vacant, I decided to use my phone charger to charge my phone. Cabin crew Kim passed by and saw me sitting on the seat charging my phone and she said loudly and rudely that I was not supposed to sit on seat 21D and that I should get back to my seat. I told her I was just charging my phone and it was empty, she walked away, and sent another flight attendant Jim, the flight attendant was equally disrespectful, rude, loud and unprofessional, told me to get up go to my seat. He said if I wanted to continue to sit on the seat that I should pay the upgraded charge. I requested him to let me at least use the phone charger so I could charge my phone and he rudely said no. He said I pay the upgraded fee and only then I could use the charging socket to charge my phone. It was not what they said that was upsetting, but how disrespectfully, rudely and loudly they said it that really was very upsetting. Very disappointed with United Airlines.",-1

I missed my outbound flight to Las Vegas. After speaking to an agent by phone, while still at the airport, I was able to get on the following flight. A few days later, as my return flight was approaching, I hadn't received a notification to check in. After holding for about 45 minutes with United customer service, I was told my return flight had been canceled. United did not have any explanation for canceling my return flight. I certainly didn't cancel my return flight. United said my only option to fly to Denver that day was to purchase a $1500 first class ticket. I could not afford a $1500 ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket to Denver for the next day. This caused me to spend nearly $600 for the new ticket and hotel for one more night. After several emails to United, all they offered me was 300 in credits that would expire in one year. My total expenses were nearly $1000. I explained I don't travel often and the credits have no value to me. They said there was nothing more they could offer. My original round trip flight was $400. Because United mistakenly canceled my flight I ended paying $600 to get back to Denver. They obviously don't care about retaining customers. They are the worst airline.",-1

They forced me to gate check my carry on bag. The flight ended up getting cancelled and they refused to give back the gate checked bags. They ultimately lost my bag and I filed a claim for it. I have had to chase and follow up for months since. First, they tried to lie and say that the bag was found and returned to me, which it had not. Once that was clarified, they confirmed that they will refund the money for what was in the bag. This was meant to have been paid out in May. I have been chasing since. I got off a call with them now and they again have lied saying that the refund claim should have been in my account in July, which it has not. United is known for losing bags, but their support to claim back their lost luggage is atrocious. Do not fly with them.",-1

Couple of days before the flight, we got an email stating that we could change to a different flight and get seats for free. We declined it because we had to leave that morning since the wedding was that afternoon. When we reached the airport and tried to check-in, we shockingly discovered that United cancelled our ticket without notifying us and put us in the next day morning flight. A customer service lady checked my email confirmation but then said that we had changed the dates. We refused that outright saying it was just not possible!

Onboard my flight to Houston we were affected by this, United handled it the best possible way. From the moment it happened, the pilot kept us informed, the flight attendants immediately started serving cold iced water, and within 35 minutes we were given the option to deplane and stay inside the concourse where it was cooler. The entire incident only made us arrive 48 minutes later than scheduled to Houston. Kudos to United for the professional and humane way everyone was treated, no one onboard complained or created an scene as United was on top of everything. Once up in the air, I have to say that the flight and the service was friendly, fast, and efficient. I would like to continue to share how much I enjoyed this flight onboard a two-year-old 737MAX.

I won’t recommend this airline to anyone at all. On our way to Cancun the plane took off late doing late boarding and delaying for “cool off”. Also, there is no need for me to talk about providing no service, food, etc. The worst part was on our way back we had a connection flight from Houston to Vancouver with a layover of 1:40. Our plane landed on time but we couldn’t get off since “another plane was parked at our gate!” We got stuck in the plane for 20 minutes and considering clearing customs and security we missed our flight. The next flight for us was departing in 14 hours and guess what, they provided us water bottles and toothpaste after that we complained about an hour.

2023-08-30,0.5,Business,First Class,Cleveland to Newark,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,1,was a disappointment,True,"  Boarding was efficient. Onboard a comfortable seat but that was it. I understand that on a flight of just over one hour a full meal service isn’t possible (well some time ago it was, guess this is a complete different chapter) but at least you would expect to get your drinks in a proper glass and not plastic cups. Flight was not at all turbulent, so it seems to be a standard rather than a safety precaution. I like flying with United but this really was a disappointment.",1
2023-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,dissatisfied with the airline,True,"  On July 10th my fiancé booked my flight and paid an additional $150 to put my seats next to her and my in-laws after already paying $350 for the ticket itself. I had to book my flight to match hers at a later date due to the uncertainty I would have the time off. When approved we booked and prepaid instantly. Here we are on August 29th having extreme difficulties getting the seat we prepaid for. Unprofessional and unacceptable they would change my seating to a different seat to prioritize another party, they assumed I was a solo ticket due to not purchasing mine in a group at the time my fiance made her purchase with my in-laws. When all 7 of us arrived at the Eugene airport for booking they printed my tickets and it showed the seats I had prepaid for. After going through the boarding and weighing/loading my luggage I received an email stating they changed my seat. I tried to correct it there but was told there is nothing they could do and to talk to the attendant at the gate, at the gate I was told I needed to speak to the attendants at the SFO airport. Upon arrival I had to wait until 9:33pm before I could try to correct my abrupt and unapproved seat change for my flight that boards at 10:55pm. When I was finally able to speak to Mark I was told it was too late to change my seat due to the flight being overcrowded. Again unprofessional they would change my prepaid seat on my flight to prioritize another party. United Airlines are uncooperative unwilling to assist in correcting their own mistakes and would rather direct me to call United Airlines for a refund. I can't tell anyone what to do but I can say this is not the flight company to fly with. They do not care about customer service, the people paying their bills by booking these flights and paying extra for specific seats. Overall dissatisfied with the airline, the attendants and the disrespect I received. For this specific air trip I prepaid for seat 29B and was moved to seat 31E. Fiancé, uncle and mother in laws seats were 28 A,B and C.",-1
2023-08-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Kona via Chicago,1.0,,4.0,,,3.0,1,United Airlines customer review,True," Poor experience with what had been a favorite. I have not flown in years & it seems United Airlines is far worse than any other airlines I have flown with. Before my flight, I had issues as they erased all of my frequent flier miles from the past. Flight date came around & I purchased roundtrip flight from PHL to KOA, with a stop in Chicago. On the date of my flight, all flights from Philadelphia to Chicago was canceled due to weather. I understand weather is out of their control, however the ticket clause & when purchased these tickets, I was guaranteed a partial or full refund. No flight had been rebooked when I logged into my app at 404am. My flight was set for 6:25am. The only option I was given was for ""full price"" of both of my tickets. I was on my way to the airport to catch the only connecting flight to Kona on 7/29, which was an American flight. During this duration I attempted to speak with an agent & after sitting on hold 15+ min, I hung up. I ended up selecting the full refund option around 550am, as the ticket clause reflects options may be removed after the time of departure of original flight. Decided I would just call in after my trip & repurchase tickets, since their flight clause clearly outlines this may occur at no additional cost or fees. After my flight home I immediately contacted support. I record all phone calls with all support centers, as I work in a call center/understand ins & outs. I was told to put in a request thru their system, as this is the only way. Since initial flight was canceled the system said ""error."" I used my new flight details & I was denied.",-1
2023-08-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Houston,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3,steadily gone down hill,True," Just curious if anyone else has booked tickets, confirmed their seating assignments for all tickets to keep them together at the time of booking. Then reconfirmed them at check-in then reconfirmed them again upon checking luggage to only have some “genius” at United to prioritize someone else being together over your confirmed ticketed seats? Well just happened and I can’t say that United hasn’t steadily gone down hill well really since the old Continental days. Something N.E. who was obviously too lazy to book their tickets and confirm seating with them obviously went to a gate agent that felt it was more important for these parties to be seated together than me and my party. Not that I wouldn’t have considered moving if it was warranted but to have a gate agent just arbitrarily make the decision to split my ticketed seats up so that someone else could sit together is well ridiculous. But then again we are in the world of everyone gets a trophy and there is obviously no reason to incentivize booking and confirming seating. Maybe next time I will just see if I can get some gate agent to kick someone from first class because we’ll I deserve it more than they do or at least in my honest opinion I do.",-1

Got told in Denver I couldn't change my flight directly to Alaska even though they had room I had to go land in Denver, fly to Chicago, then to Alaska. All together 15hrs from the time I left home. No other airline has ever had an issue with me doing this. Not to mention you have to fight to get your travel points, app is so trash you can't even use your points on the app you literally have to go on a laptop. God forbid you attempt to contact customer service and need help because that an entirely different issue. All around worst airline. And no it's not like I have flown with them once or twice - every single time I fly with united some issues arise.  If you book with United do expect anything other than going from one point on the map to the next. And pray everything goes perfectly because people don't do their jobs here clearly.",-1

Original flight at 11pm from Newark to London canceled after keeping us on the plane for an hour, then deplaning for an hour, then reboarding for an hour and finally cancelling us at 2.35 am! Chaos at the terminal after. Rebooked onto a flight at 6am to Washington and then a 8.25 am to Heathrow. Still waiting to push back from Washington and the crew just told us the entertainment is broken on the entire plane. Nightmare. No compensation. No free wifi to apologize for the lack of entertainment. Awful.",-1
2023-08-21,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Buffalo,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5,pleased with United Airlines,False,"  I am pleased with United Airlines. On our return home, we were delayed because of storms in Chicago. The agents were very helpful and polite. They were kind to everyone. It was pretty stressful and they offered to assist in getting hotel rooms etc. While I was waiting in line to get my connecting flight figured out, I signed onto the website and was able to complete everything using the chat agent. It was so helpful. I also got online and booked a hotel room that had a shuttle service and we didn't have to wait for the personal agent. Yes, it was very inconvenient but they did their best to help us and they gave free snacks while we waited to see if the flight was going to be canceled. I am very pleased it all worked out and the next day it all went smoothly. The plane also had free movies for my kiddo which kept him entertained.",1
2023-08-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lihue to Denver,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,not humane and did not help,False," I have a severe and deadly tree nut allergy, and on the flight to Kauai from Denver they served a cashew bar with their lunch to everyone on the plane. I started to feel itchy on my skin and throat from the cashew particles after people opened them, so I stood at the back of the plane for 2 hours to let it subside. Luckily, I wasn’t exposed to enough particles to initiate an anaphylactic reaction. During my vacation, I called United and requested tree nut bars to not be on my flight back, but the agent kept robotically repeating that they can not guarantee nuts won’t be on the plane. The response was not humane and did not help whatsoever, which was very frustrating and disheartening to hear as I could die if the anaphylactic reaction is severe enough that even epinephrine or Benadryl could not stop the reaction while in the air over the Pacific Ocean. When I got to the airport to get on the flight back, I talked to the flight attendants and they told me a macadamia nut bar was being served and that it was part of the catering and could not be removed. They told me that all they could do was ask people around me to not open them, but still had to serve them to everyone due to policy, and that I would have to fly at my own risk and there was nothing else they could do. I could not cancel as I had to return home at that time and probably could not get a refund anyway. I wore a mask during the flight, did not eat anything, and was nervous and anxious the entirety of the flight. This experience was very surprising as tree nut allergies are becoming increasingly common. If you have a tree nut allergy, I would advise you to fly other airlines with better policies and more humanity, such as Delta.",-1

I flew from Chicago to Dublin. But at Dublin airport, they have charged for an extra luggage for my Icelandair flight using the credit card that I used to book my air ticket.

2023-08-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Dulles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,delayed for no reason,False,  Flight was delayed for no reason. No communication given to passengers. Gate changed with no notification from the airlines. No customer service to speak of. No actual details to speak of nor context as to why we are waiting. No support from United nor affiliates.

But sitting in the back of the plane had nothing to watch. They also, said my dad did not pre order food for us, so we had to wait 3 hours before we got any sort of water or food, this is rude because people in economy class have to wait forever. This is rude and not ok for a major airline to do this on a 5 hour flight. It was nice having 1 person who cared for our whole family and I am thankful for this.",-1

I went to the UA desk two ladies said there was no need to take the luggage it would be put in the next flight. In hall 3 it was chaos, We waited in the line to 07:00 pm then we got on the bus to the hotel, there we were told that the driver took us to the wrong hotel that has the same name, so we had to go on our own to the other hotel. At the hotel, the WIFI was down and I found out that the phone number they provided us with to call for a reservation was wrong We didn't have a sim card because we were transiting through Paris. The next day the bus took us to the wrong terminal. When we finally got to Newark, there was no luggage, I waited to Friday from Saturday I still haven't received anything, One suitcase arrived damaged and no refund. UA partners with Air Algerie, witch is notorious for delays, as were delay on our departure flight from Rome to Algiers, one luggage didn't arrive and it turned out it was sent from Newark to London instead of Rome by UA crew, I went back 04 times to the airport to get the luggage witch killed my vacation plan Conclusion: I will never travel again with United Airlines",-1

Flight was delayed 2 hours from Seattle to Chicago which caused us to miss our connecting flight to Cedar Rapids. I had to work the next day so we had to rent a car for over $500 to drive home 3+ hours to the airport. Then when we tried to get our money back for it, they only credited us a $100 on each of our tickets and refused to pay for the car rental.

2023-08-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"never fly United again"" ",True,"  2nd leg of a trip back to Chicago from Athens, stopover in Montreal, then flight to Chicago. 7 of us (family) were traveling. Boarded the plane headed to Chicago (Thursday night), sat for 30+ minutes at gate, then pilot announced a 'mechanical problem' and then said even if we got another flight he and his crew would not be flying us (over his allotment?). we de-planed and queued up at gate to find out how United (and Air Canada as United proxy) were going to get us home. after an hour wait, we got to gate attendant who said they do not re-book at the gate (weird, because every other airline I've had to make alternative arrangements through, does it at the gate), she gave us a hotel voucher (for one night) and told us to call the number on the business cards they had at the desk. United was ZERO help in getting us home, much less quickly. we were stranded in Montreal until Sunday morning, United has refused to reimburse us for the extra $1500 in expenses we were forced to pay for hotels (Friday/Saturday) and food for 7 for 3 days. Will obvioulsy nevwr fly United again, they are by far the worst airline for actually having planes fly to their designated destination.

My flight supposed to be NONSTOP to RDU airport. First of all my flight was delayed for an hour. When we boarded the plane we didn’t take off until 30 mins later. I received a notification stating my flight has been modified meaning we had to make a stop at Washington IAD. When we get there I was notified that my flight came in late which made me miss my flight to RDU airport. I’m highly disappointed with United Airlines for their lack of communication and sense of urgency. But I thank they lady at customer for service for booking me a flight back home nonstop.

We were to have only 2 nights in San Fran and ended up with only one but still had to pay 2 nights hotel. A week later we flew to New York from Vegas. Flight was supposed to depart at 1050pm ended up departing next day at 8am. This airline also over sold tickets by 19 seats and threatened that they would not leave unless 19 volunteered to go on another date. I’m doubtful that our flight on Thursday will actually depart,-1
2023-08-09,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Cleveland,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,service as terrible as this experience was,True,"  The flight was delayed a total of 6-hours, and though there was decent communication about the delay, the timeliness as well as reasons for the delay remain unknown. The delay first started as a 30-min delay from 12:45pm to 1:15pm, then it delayed further to 2pm, 3pm, 5::15, and finally to 6:15pm. During this entire ordeal no reasons were provided and the gate attendants were all but useless. Speaking of the gate area - the seats at OIA used by United are quite possibly the most uncomfortable seats ever created. I find it unbelievable that they would choose such uncomfortable seating - truly a disservice to their paying customers. Once were were able to begin boarding, the gate attendants provided very little in the form of communication - the did the minimum necessary which was announce the group numbers and nothing else. It was as if they were simply trying to take all the irate passengers in the concourse and pawn them off to the flight attendant staff. That they did very well. On the plane, it became evident that both the flight crew and attendant staff were frustrated as well. They did not put their best face forward as the pilot sounded very terse in the few announcement he made, and the flight attendants only handed out the complimentary snacks to less than half of coach. This occurred because of mild turbulence they sat through for what was honestly only 10-minutes. Once we were riding on clean air, they resumed only to hand out small cups of water - a disservice to the paying customers on the flight. Furthermore, it was this same flight attendant staff that confidently proclaimed the baggage claim area to go to after disembarking. Only to find out they sent us to the wrong baggage claim area. This of course added to the frustration of the entire experience with United. Moving forward, I will make every effort to never flight United again - I can certainly make that choice for my personal trips and will lobby at my place of employment to seek other airlines for future travel on work-related business. Given all the choices that exist, there should be no room for such service as terrible as this experience was.",-1
2023-08-09,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Nice via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,makes it tough to make a claim,False,"  I recently took a family vacation in Italy and United Airlines lost my bags! Its an all too familiar story of the same situation, but with a different passenger. As my son and I got to the airport in Las Vegas, we were headed to Newark, Nice, France then Venice, Italy to start our trip. As we checked our bags at the United counter in Las Vegas, we saw our bags tagged by the agent, then placed on the luggage belt to our destination (Las Vegas to Newark, Newark to Nice), where we would collect our bags and stay a night before our month long vacation and journey to Italy the next day. When we arrived in Nice, we uncomfortably had to file an airport reference claim when none of our bags showed up. After our night in Nice, we were starting our family vacation to Venice, which was supposed to be our first destination. Our luggage never made it. We had no clothes, or items that we packed for our trip. We trusted United Airlines. We were told our bags were stuck in Newark and they would be on the next flight to Nice. However, we were now supposed to be in Venice! We changed our flights, changed our cities and called many times just to be misdirected by the airlines. They gave us the run around. United lied and told us our bags were now going to catch up with us in Nice, then Naples. This literally went on for 4 weeks. Everything we did to call United, email, and text them, was a waste of time & a whole lot of money. They misled us because in reality the airline never really knew where our bags were. We incurred thousands of dollars in expenses, we lost thousands of dollars of our personal belongings, all to come home at the end of the month in June to bags that remain gone. We called everyday and United told us a different city, country, & state each time. We still have no bags now its two months later. The aggravation, energy, and money spent by us outweighs the mistake. Its unbelievable that in this day and age United (or any airline) still doesn't have a better system. Now, two months later, they told us to file a claim. We've had to deal with the major inconvenience of losing money with extra changes, travel expenses, replacing whatever items were most important, and time spent that we lost while dealing with the airline. The hold times we spent on the phone overseas and after our vacation to the dysfunctional people who misled us at United Airlines, etc. When we were told to make a claim I have to say, United Airlines makes it tough to make a claim easily. The website is flawed, there isn't enough room for our information and/or receipts (they allow you to upload 10 receipts for reimbursement only). United makes it so tough to make a proper claim which is a tactic to deter travelers from even making one. They do this to frustrate an already extremely frustrated passenger so they can cover their own asses. Its inconvenience at its best. Then, they tell you you'll need to wait up to 10 weeks for your claim to be answered. By then, your loss is already in the thousands. After all of the drama, lies, misleading information, you'll get exhausted and the trip basically (no matter how beautiful) is tainted and thats all you really remembered in the end. Its unfair! Its violating. It is inconvenient and not worth it. United Airlines is totally at fault. We were even told at one time that our bags were in Minnesota, then Houston. Come on! Brand new cities that we never even traveled to on a daily basis. United get it together!",-1

They gave me another flight the next day with one stop at Denver. I arrive at Denver when I was informed my send leg of the flight is cancelled. They gave a third booking for the next day that was also cancelled. I finally was able to get on a plane on standby. Basically a 5 hours flight turned in to 74 hours. If this is not enough I learned that my return flight was canceled as part of the first cancellation without letting me know. Very frustrating.

I miss my plane and then I call the plane people to say that I wanted to refund. And they told me that they would give me flat credit instead of my money back and I told them that I didn't won't fly credit because I wouldn't be flying out again because I have to take care of my husband.

We originally had a direct flight to Denver but had to connect through San Francisco. The second delay caused us to miss our connection in San Francisco.

We landed from Delhi to Toronto at 5:36 am and had our connecting flights with United airlines. We were at the gate since morning and they did not allow us to board. They said unable to find your seat, I showed them our boarding pass and had web checked in. They said they have internal issues. Then said flight is full. My child was with me and he said how come you are still allowing boarding. Then they closed the gate and said you were not here in time. How come others were still allowed to board the flight.  We were not given any flight and stuck in Toronto for 2 days with child. It is the worst nightmare ever .",-1
2023-08-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Chattanooga,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,obviously don’t put their customers first,True," United Airlines caused our trip disruption a few weeks ago and talked us into flying into another airport in another state. They then said we could rent a car to get us back to our destination airport and that they would reimburse us for the rental and gas. I filed all the forms with United Airlines and submitted receipts which were just below $600. What did they do? They gave us a $200 flight credit. Are you kidding me? We will no longer fly United Airlines and cancel our credit cards and anything else associated with United Airlines. My friends, if you must fly, avoid United Airlines as they obviously don’t put their customers first. Feel free to share this to help others avoid the same problem. #unitedairlines",-1
2023-08-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1,didn't get wheelchair assistance,True,"  I booked United Airline flight for my mother because it was direct flight from India to USA & certainly most costly. She doesn't understand English & she is 70 year old so requested for wheelchair assistance & united airline assured me that she will get wheelchair. I stay in Dallas, she was flying back to Delhi via New York on July 28. When she was about to land in New York at 7 pm EST we got message that her next flight from New York to Delhi is cancelled. After coming out of flight she didn't even get wheelchair assistance. Some other passenger helped her to change the terminal, after reaching on terminal C she was all alone. She called me & I told her to give phone to some Airline person so that I can talk. She requested many airline/airport people to talk on phone but no one was willing to help. Some other passenger helped her to get hotel stay voucher (she got this voucher in midnight) but they didn't provide cab & wheelchair assistance so she was not able to go to hotel. I don't know anyone in New York so I had to ask her to stay at airport full night. Next morning I booked flight to New York & met her at 2 pm. United arranged another flight on July 29 so she fled back in night & I came back to Dallas by catching early morning flight which costed me $658. My mother reached India but her luggage didn't reach. It took another 2 day to get the luggage. I understand flight cancellation can happen because of one or another reason but frustration is Airline didn't give her wheelchair assistance though I had mentioned it to Airline that she need full support as she doesn't understand English. She was all alone at Airport for full night and next half day. Due to Airline mistake she suffered, scared, cried & I had to spent overall $1000 to go to New York and come back again.",-1

My husband and I have had perpetually horrible flight experiences with almost every flight in the last 4 months being delayed. Our most recent flight experience was horrendous from MSP to DEN (we live in Denver and are held hostage many times by having a United Hub there). With our boarding starting at 4:15 pm, we started receiving 15 minute updates with delay notifications , which eventually turned into 30 minute delay notifications only to have our flight fully cancelled at around 8:30pm. I empathize with the desk staff as they had no control and were clearly being kept in the dark as well. We were missing flight crew. That's it. Our pilots were onsite along with one stewardess but we needed two additional flight crew in order to get in the air and United couldn't make it happen. After speaking with a member of the United staff, I was told to book the 5am flight, but was later informed by another United insider that it was a huge risk because we may very likely be in the same situation. We ended up canceling completely and moving to Delta - Bear in mind I will need to spend all day on the phone fighting for a full refund as that is not their first course of remediation. All in all, they aren't worth it; fly with another airline. My husband who travels occasionally for work had two other flights in the past three months fully cancelled on him, while I (who also travels for work) mostly experience long delays. I don't care about the points I have accumulated thus far, they are too awful to stay with and I recommend choosing any other airline. Their seats aren't comfortable and are very closely packed together with little space (unlike Delta), their flight schedule appears to rarely run on time, and their customer support is painful to work with. Save yourself the hassle.",-1
2023-07-31,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Detroit,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,not recommend this airline,False,"  Worst airline in the world. Can’t keep up with their own time schedule and change the timing quite often. Worst customer service. I will not recommend this airline. They have already changed the timing of take off 4 times and they are still changing. They can’t give a proper reason why the change. As soon as I get to my destination, I need to change my return ticket to some other airline.",-1

2023-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Houston,2.0,,,,,1.0,1,refused to give us another flight,False,  They canceled our 1200pm flight at 4.38 am. We showed up to the airport and they refused to give us another flight The worse service I’ve ever seen. They were unhelpful and uncaring. We have a party of seven people. We are physicians and we have patients to see.,-1
2023-07-30,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Toronto,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,I might as well walk to Canada,False,"  First got delayed for 3 hours then cancelled 30mins before boarding 11pm at night. Literally no hotel but the one in the airport available. Then now, same time the next day, delayed again. I might as well walk to Canada because I would be at least making progress. I would give them 0/10 if I could.",-1
2023-07-29,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Los Angeles,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,only had standby for two days,False," They cancelled the day of and only had standby for two days. My trip has been shortened due to this and I can only imagine the nightmare this would be if I had a connecting flight. In the past I've had ""weather"" warnings for it to them become mechanical issues. No flight is ever promised with this airline and if you choose to take United during this time I'd advise against that. Me and many other individuals are on standby flights for a day +. United, the flights are NEVER certain, checking in your bags is a gamble and staff is rarely helpful.",-1
2023-07-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Newark,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,They are just pathetic!,False,"  Actually “Not Good” is too kind for United Airlines. They are just pathetic! Why? For the last 7 tickets we booked, they CANCELLED 6 of them. They even cancelled the replacement tickets on three of them and then proceeded to place those on a standby flight. The disruption this causes and the money that is lost from their incompetence is flabbergasting. AirBnB bookings that is too late to cancel has to be paid for regardless of the fact that we sit 12 hours at Newark, bleary eyed, hungry and frustrated. Rental cars paid for and then new arrival times at the destination airport forces more time wasted because we have to wait for the rental car places to open. United just pulls their shoulders up and essentially goes “megh!” when we call. We have spent countless hours on the phone to rebook flights, not to mention the time we have spent writing in customer complaints. They don’t even send a automated response to the written complaints, it is just silent. They gave us $20 for meals on the 12 hour delay at Newark, you can purchase a dry sandwich at a vending machine for that. They partially refund hotel fairs that are lost. Don’t fly United Airlines!",-1
2023-07-29,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Tucson,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,never fly with these people again,True,  Our flight from Chicago to Denver was delayed they didn't bother to wait for us to catch our connecting flight they gave us no information except to stand in an outrageous long line to rebook our flight cuz they canceled ours. I am currently in line still my luggage is missing their app has a bug and every single one of the people who work here don't care and is very rude. I will never fly with these people again. I'm assuming I'll be waiting hours to get home.,-1
2023-07-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Wilkes-Barre,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,zero communication to customers,True,"  United is the dollar general of air lines. You would be better taking a train across the country than dealing with or flying within a United plane. A complete lack of customer / passenger communication when stuck in a taxi hood for 1 hour! The pilot nor the attendant has said a word. Is this likely a combined air traffic control issue as well, sure - but to provide zero communication to customers is unacceptable. In fact the attendant actually told a women to sit down that needed to go the bathroom because she was waiting for a hour on the tarmac! United’s 2 of 5 ratings are an over estimation. Trash!",-1
2023-07-29,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Kahului via Los Angeles,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4,a very good flight,False,"  This flight was a very good flight and the cabin crew and ground crew were really nice. The seats were fairly comfortable and they had tvs on them with movies, tv shows, and games. The snack boxes on the flight were good and they had little snacks in them. The bathrooms were very small though so you can’t really move around in them. Overall I think United airlines is one of the best airlines in the U.S.",1
2023-07-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to Newark,,,,,,,1,requesting them to refund but keeps getting denied,False,"  I really do not appreciate the service offered by United Airlines. I purchased a ticket in Economy class along with another ticket for 2 just extra seats as my wife has some issues traveling in economy class. Later I found a cheap Business class ticket on United website which I then asked United to upgrade one of the tickets by combining both tickets. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my flight due to medical reasons so I requested to get refund which they approved. Still they returned only a portion in me and rest they gave as ETC. I mean what kind of logic is this, if a ticket gets cancelled it always gives a ETC for future use. When I ask them to refund the rest they asked to create ticket from Customer service. Now the customer service is even not responding as they keep forwarding the request to Refunds. This is insane, I submitted request to get refund due to medical reasons. There should always be room for some exceptions, I do not travel much and this money will go to waste if they give me as ETC. That is why I keep requesting them to refund but keeps getting denied. What kind of customer service is this, is this a way to treat a customer and this refunds Department seems very rude and not at all helping.  This is the worst customer experience I received in my whole life. I have been a customer support before, I thought treating customer is the first preference. This concept seems to have stopped when it comes to United Airlines. This is not acceptable at any circumstances.",-1
2023-07-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Columbus via Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,We bought 2 tickets on another airline,True, Our original flight was delayed 4 hours which meant we had missed our connecting flight to Houston which was later canceled all together. We got a hotel in Vegas and we’re told that there were no flights available to Ohio that day so we were rebooked to Houston the following day. We were on hold with the airline for 3 1/2 hours but no one answered. That evening we received a text that the flight was canceled to Houston and they would try to rebook us. It never happened. We got online to try to chat but again no response. We bought 2 tickets on another airline. Tried to get reimbursed for the flights but was told it didn’t meet their criteria for a refund!!,-1
2023-07-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,Not the best Airline,True," United Airlines canceled our flight the same day of travel. Our Luggage was missing and came home more than a week later. United will almost never give you a refund or listen to you. Not the best Airline. If you have a choice and you want to avoid the stress, choose something else.",-1
2023-07-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to London,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst airline ever,True,  This airline is the worst airline ever. I got on 3 planes and still in the same place. This airline is unprofessional and need to be shut completely down. Customer service sucks the one employee literally took a nap in front of me while I was waiting on a delay flight that never left because the pilots say they had already did their time after coming off a 5 hour break from my first delay. I will rather fly Frontier then this raggedy airline.,-1
2023-07-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Dubai,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,very worst experience with this airline,True,"  I had a very worst experience with this airline. we boarded flight on time around 9 pm est. After boarding the flight was delayed with no proper update. After waiting an hour in the flight, got an update a passenger being sick and waiting for the crew to offboard their check in luggage and the expected take off time is 11.40. Waited with 2 kids in the flight till 11.40. got one small badam packet, water and a burger as dinner. Again around 11.40 received an update the crew just reached and still searching for bag. After an hour , received update need to change flight crew and they are going to another gate 126 and board again at 1.15 am est. Waited till 1.15 am in flight, again received an announcement that flight is cancelled. We were asked to get down and many didnt even realize the flight is cancelled. Got announcement that collect luggage in drop 5 and the bags were being sent slowly almost taking 1.5 hrs even to get the luggage. Also they asked one counter will be open till 3 am and we have to rebook if required before 3 am. The one counter which was open till 3 am, there was a huge line and almost till 7.30 we were just standing on line. Finally fed up and booked a hotel by ourself and many hotels didnt allow check in during that time. finally we got one for paying 300$ for 4 hours, booked cab by ourself. at 1.30 qe received a message that we got meal vouchers value 15$, 2 per passenger. the worst airline and the pain we had on that night with 2 kids are unbearable. after long struggle we booked air India from JFK, initial trip was from newark. Unexpected delays or cancelations are understandable, but airlines should be able to handle the passengers during the situation.",-1
2023-07-25,0.9,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Denver,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,Extremely happy with my experience,False," I usually only see negative reviews for airlines specifically when people are furious. I am providing a good review in hopes that airlines will really start to consider customer service and the reliability of the flights that the consumers are purchasing. The United employee the morning of my flight was extremely helpful, organized, and clear. She arrived 30 min before everyone else (3 AM) and still helped everyone get in the proper place before TSA or check-in opened. I promptly made it through security and the flight took off on time and as planned. The flight attendants were spectacular and the pilot clearly communicated with updates throughout the flight. Extremely happy with my experience, thank you.",1
2023-07-24,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Memphis to Denver,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,2,seriously unprofessional,True," We waited over an hour because the baggage loader broke. It’s seriously unprofessional how the flight was handled. Why the hell did I pay for carry on bags to avoid issues with the airport managing luggage only to wait hours for luggage! Also, the crew being unable to receive answers from their management is unfair to them. They’re out in front of angry customers who just want to go home. On top of that, the floor of the airplane was filthy. You’d think in the extra hour and change they had to prepare they’d get it a bit clean.",-1

Supposed to have been electronic device charging stations between the seats and there weren't any on the plane at all. One of your flight attendants was very rude! Will NEVER fly this airline again. There was also supposed to be onboard WiFi and it wouldn't work either.,-1
2023-07-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Guadalajara,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They truly do not care,False,"  The worst experience I’ve ever had. If you can, try to avoid united. Their system was down the more I got to the airport. They were unable to print out my boarding pass which made me miss my flight. They found and alternative route to get to my destination but, manage to leave my check-In luggage back home. Horrible communication skills, got to my destinations with absolutely no clothes and still wanting for some sort of compensation. Please look for alternative options before flying with United. They truly do not care.",-1
2023-07-22,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Seattle via Chicago,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,1.0,4,I have a major complaint with United,True,  Baggage handler broke off key in ignition to my electric scooter upon arrival in Seattle. Was unable to help get it out and not useable in Seattle during my vacation. Very inconvenient as a disabled person who relies on my scooter for traveling. Local repair shop got it out for me but had to order new key which I won't get until my return home. First time I have a major complaint with United and intend on filing a claim for new keys.,1
2023-07-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Kansas city via Chicago,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,4.0,1,I will never prefer United airlines,True,  Worst airline I ever travelled they delayed connecting flight in Chicago which messed up my plans in Kansas City I planned earlier and they are not interested to give refund or modify the ticket. Here after I will never prefer United airlines. They should maintain time sense to reach on time. Useless airline in USA.,-1
2023-07-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Papeete,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,wouldn't conceive flying Polaris again,False," Polaris class SFO-PPT and back. Never again. First, check-in for Polaris at SFO was surreal, with 50+ people on line and only one agent actively checking Polaris-class passengers in. I found myself longing for the business-class check-in desks at the other, non-U.S. carriers in the International Terminal, carriers that actually seem to offer a premium service to people who have paid for it. I arrived at the terminal two hours before my United flight but got only 20 minutes in the lounge as a result of this mess. Second, United's boarding process is a slap in the face to passengers who pay upwards of $7000 for a seat in Polaris. If you're not a member of one of their frequent-flyer levels, you're forced to board with economy-class passengers. Every other airline in existence lets passengers in the premium cabin board first, before the coach stampede starts with people pushing and shoving to board so they can get first claim to overhead space. This is one reason why I will never fly United again. Third, my berth in Polaris was filthy, with lint and crumbs littering the air vent along the bulkhead. Fourth, the food in Polaris was virtually inedible. Again, when you're paying upwards of $7000 for a ticket, you expect something that isn't going to make you gag. Unfortunately, United is the only airline apart from budget carrier French Bee that flies from SFO to Tahiti nonstop. For any other international route where there's competition, however, I wouldn't conceive of ever flying United Polaris again.",-1
2023-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Newark,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,completely dissatisfied,False," Horrible customer service. Was stranded in Italy with my daughter because of an error on the first leg of the trip using Lufthansa. The UA booking agent wrote my daughters name incorrectly for that leg of the trip (which had a different confirmation number), so we were unable to return. When I called long distance from Italy to try to get another flight (there is no UA office at the airport), the customer service rep didn’t fix the error, didn’t book us a new flight since we missed the first one by trying to get the name corrected, and hung up on me. This left us stranded in a foreign country with NO ticket home as a result of their error. I called back again and finally got tickets back to a different airport and my daughter and I had to find our own way back from New Jersey to CT, taking four different trains with our large suitcases in tow. I’m completely dissatisfied with this airline and the whole customer service experience. The flight and attendants were excellent, but the customer service was abysmal.",-1

Paid for 1st class and barely got any service in outbound flight. Return flight even worse, seats 4A and 4B in first class don't recline, seats and center were covered in something? Smashed food? Who knows. Snacks taste old and stale. Didn't get a headset so couldn't even use TV.",-1
2023-07-20,0.9,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Newark,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,3.0,5,Premium Plus seat was comfortable,True," I booked this flight anticipating to fly on United 787-10. However, it was swapped to a 777-200. As it was a retrofitted 777 with proper Premium Plus seats, it was not bad. LAX is certainly not the best airport, as the boarding area was tiny, thus very crowded. The Premium Plus seat was comfortable. We had the first row with huge legroom, more like 55-in rather than the normal 38-in pitch. In-flight meals were fine, and they served a full meal plus a light meal (by choice). That was quite good for a 4.5 hour domestic flight in premium economy. The fight departed on time and arrived early, which was good.",1
2023-07-20,0.9,Family Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Los Angeles,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,5,best domestic transcontinental equipment,True,"  Ground service at EWR was mediocre, as expected. That was probably more about the airport than the airline. However, the new United Club was nice. It was spacious with many food choices (by American carriers' standard). The flight departed on time and arrived early. The 787-10 was the highlight. I purposely booked this flight because of it, and it was perhaps the best domestic transcontinental equipment available today. Service was fine, not over the top but was enough. In-flight meals were quite a step up from my previous UA flights.",1

These guys are terrible! Coming and going, delay, delay, delay...except for the very last leg of our trip. But since the previous flight was delayed, the door to our plane was closed when we got to the gate and they wouldn't let us on. We ran all across the airport to board the plane and that was the one that departed on time?! They couldn't delay that one two minutes to make up for their error? Needless to say, the boarding agent couldn't care less about what their mistakes cost me in time (another 5 1/2 hour delay) and frustration. Will never...ever fly with them again!",-1
2023-07-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Rochester via Newark,5.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,will not be flying United ever again,False," I do not usually write reviews, but this was the most horrific flying experience I have ever had in my life. I get to the Jacksonville airport at 5:00 am for a 6:30 flight. At the boarding and luggage check booth, where there were nearly 100 people waiting, there was one attendant on duty - it took a solid hour just to print my boarding pass and check my luggage. All other airlines had several attendants working. After sprinting to my gate, I found out that the flight had been delayed for 3 full hours. When we finally boarded, I got a message saying that my connecting flight to Rochester had been cancelled. After standing not one, but two customer service lines, I was able to book a flight to Syracuse. Originally leaving at 9:30, the flight was again delayed by an hour. We landed at 12:00 am, but taxied for another 40 minutes because the airline had sent an unscheduled flight to our departure gate for cleaning. Never in my life have I experienced this level of negligence at an airline. On transferring to Syracuse I asked the customer service representative if I had to re-check my baggage. She told me ""no"", and that I was ""in the system"". I asked the concierge at the gate for Syracuse the same thing - he said ""no"". After deplaning, I discovered that my luggage had been left in Newark. It is now 11:00 pm the next day, and the luggage has just now been delivered to my hotel. I will not be flying United ever again, and I will be dissuading everyone I can to use it in the future.",-1

They are horrible at doing their jobs. I had a toddler with me who was supposed to sit on my lap. We were traveling with my spouse and the kiosk wouldn’t allow check in. We came in two hours before our flight and got tossed around. We were advised to see a kiosk with an attendant on it waited 30 minutes and we still couldn’t get checked in. At this point we had a little under an hour to get everything done yet no one knows how to get my boarding pass printed with my lap baby. My husband was able to board but I missed my flight. They told me to wait on a line that took over 2.5 hours to get to a rep and that as far as they are concerned I missed my flight even though there was still time. I had two employees bicker in front of my family because the employee asked another employee to assist and she didn’t like that we were thrown on her. After I waited for 2.5 hours to get this situation rectified the rep told me there was nothing he can do because the confirmation was split once my husband got his pass and I essentially lost my reservation and had to wait 1.5 hours to get ahold of a reservation specialist on the phone. FYI they don’t have reservation specialists in the airport. United employees doesn’t take responsibility or try to correct the situation. I was left to make other plans with another airline company as being stranded in an airport with a toddler wasn’t going to work. I went to JetBlue and they had zero issues with processing my lap baby’s pass. United doesn’t care about their customers, if they had it there way I would have been stranded for two days. Also they are unbelievably understaffed and we’re cancelling a lot of flights. There was a mob of angry people. Save your money, they may be worse than southwest and spirit at this point. I will never purchase from them again & they should honestly be ashamed of the “service” they provide.",-1

Boarding took longer than the 2 flights we took with Southwest during the same trip. Crew tried to makes things better. No internet. No TV plugs. Like flying in 1968. I was working and my husband let a friend who is a travel agent book our trip. At a family gathering we had no one there who flies United (and half our family is from Britain) . Now I know why.

Then the departure flight from Washington to New York is delayed for a total of 8 times. And the company refuse to make any sort of compensation.,-1
2023-07-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Charlotte,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,given my seat to someone else,False," Was scheduled for a 2pm flight on Monday. Flight was canceled and I was rebooked for a 7pm flight. After several delays that flight was canceled and I was rebooked for a 9pm flight the next day or 26 hours later. After talking to an agent he got me a standby ticket for a 7am flight the next morning. After spending the night at airport, it looked like I would get a seat on the 7am flight. Even received a text from United saying ""Good news"" I had seat on that flight. Then after all the groups had boarded I approached agent desk and handed them my ticket and the agent announced they would be calling the standbys by name. So I sat back down, fully expecting my name to be called. She then pointed to a gentleman and he was allowed to board. She the pointed to another gentleman and asked him for his name. He answered an she said he could board. But he was with his wife. Agent said there was only one seat available and the agent let wife board and they were done boarding. I approached agent and showed her messaged from United that I had a seat on that flight. She said she had no idea what that message meant. I knew what it meant. It meant she had given my seat to someone else. instead of reading from the list of standbys like she said she would she handpicked her standbys. The only reason. I didn't raise a fuss then is I wanted to get home not on the ""No fly list"".",-1

While the flight attendants were friendly and were doing the best they could, it was clear they were short-staffed.  We sat at the back and at every meal they had run out of at least one of the offerings. We had an unpleasant tasting vegetarian pasta for dinner and a very pathetic, dry wrapped sandwich for lunch.  At SFO, despite having a voucher offered by United for United Club access, the staff at the counter denied us entry because it was ""high season.""",-1
2023-07-16,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Tulsa to Brussels via Chicago,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,incompetence on the highest levels,True,"  Absolute incompetence on the highest levels. Persistently delayed. Complete lack of organization or oversight. I got food poisoning from the food served on the aircraft. ORD-customs is a complete joke and when I couldn’t find my bag to clear customs I was told by a United worker to “go the hell over there”. Lost bag caused missed connection which caused 3 hours standing in line to get re-booked. Customer service? Is there such a thing or a bunch of people standing around laughing and joking at the amount of people standing in line to be rebooked. If you own stock in the company, do yourself a favor and sell it. The app doesn’t work. The website is intermittent at best. The baggage service is anything but serviceable. The “management”…my sons 3rd grade class could do a better job.  From my standpoint, I will do everything within my power to convince anyone to avoid any contact, future business or even possible employment with this airline.",-1

2023-07-15,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Atlanta via Denver,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2,customer service noticeably bad,False," United is the worst airline. I am super positive person and from the moment I was getting my bag tags the customer service (not for myself but for others) was noticeably bad. Imagine flying an airline like Southwest. It’s cheap. You expect it to suck to an extent. United is a little more expensive but not by much. Now the difference is the people working at United answer all your questions with a “matter of fact tone” to it. That’s the only difference. United’s seats all look like hot trash, nothing is new. They don’t have anything special. They got a 2 because they had buffalo trace whiskey nothing more.",-1
2023-07-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Amman via Washington,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,2.5 days lost from my vacation,False," Original flight was changed due to cancelation of flight from Tampa to Washington (IAD). United put us (me and my 2 daughters) in a new reservation that added one leg and three hours to the flight (to New York then to Washington). When we got to the airport, the new flight to New York was delayed several hours and we missed our connection, so they put us on a new flight through American Airlines, but the flight was to Reagan Airport instead. We had to take a Taxi from Regan to IAD while carrying our luggage: $75. After we boarded our 10 PM flight from IAD to Amman, it circled around for 2 hours then it was cancelled. We stood in line waiting for a representative to serve us from 12 (Midnight) tell 10 AM (10 hours waiting, not kidding, while standing, in the airport). They put us on a new flight to Dubai, and then to Amman, the next day. We stayed in Dubai for 11 hours (took a hotel in the airport, at my own expense). We added 2.5 days extra to the trip. These 2.5 days were lost from my vacation with my two daughters. And at the end, the customer care team insults me with giving me a credit of $125 towards my next flight to cover for the horror story they put us through.",-1

They canceled my flight 3 times on top of this they lost my baggage.

Crew members were late, delaying our entirely booked flight. Then we were stuck on the plane waiting for maintenance to look at a broken electrical panel cover. Perhaps checking the safety of the plane before filling it with people would have been a good idea. This airline is run by clowns and incompetent imbeciles. If I could give a 0/10 I would.",-1
2023-07-13,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Salt Lake City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,such a ridiculous policy,True,"  I grew up when airline travel was far more sophisticated and enjoyable, not to mention affordable. Unfortunately, united is now on the do not fly list that I created today. I am newly married, and on both legs of our trip, even though I booked the airline tickets at the same time, my wife and I had to sit in separate rows. apparently, their policy is that unless you pay to buy your tickets, the computer will just put you wherever it can even though you’re married and flying together. This is such a ridiculous policy and one that has cost them two new customers. The lady in Denver at the United counter was so rude to us when we asked her if she could accommodate placing us together. She looked at my wife and said well it’s a short flight and you’re only one row apart and I think you can handle it.",-1
2023-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Fort Lauderdale,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,unpleasant staff and no help,True,"  We arrived to Newark airport on June 25 from Stockholm and were going to switch to another plane to Florida. We checked the board and it shold depart from Terminal A. After about 1 hour it said delayed, and should depart from Terminal C… When we had been on Terminal C a while, the board said we were going back to Terminal A! And so on, we took the bus about 6 times back and forth, it was crazy! And during this time, NO ONE INFORMED US! During the evening the board kept changing terminals, gates etc. I went to ask a representative from United. The dialogue went like this: Me: I would like some information about Flight 1482 please Rep: It is cancelled Me: ?? But it is on the board? Rep: Yeah, the plane is here on the airport. Then she gave me a card, informing me that I shouid call their support. I waited in the telephone for 70 minutes, then I was disconnected. We also tried to go to customer center, the queue was about 1000 meters! We were at the airport 7 hours, no information, unpleasant staff, and no help. Finally, at 11:30 pm, we rented a car and drove all the way to Florida. Our trip home was better, we were allowed to go to Newark by airplane this time, but there were delays, staff were missing and unpleasant flight hostesses. I will never travel with United again!",-1

A nonstop flight was cancelled and tried to rebook me on a lengthy connecting flight. Took much time to call and rebook on a direct flight like I had. Paid for an upgrade to bring my carryon. The new flight was delayed 2.5 hours, then delayed again 2-3 hours with gate change, new plane and wait for new crew , and our place in take off line another 1 hours.

Then, when they offered to make up for it by letting us chose another flight, they ended up sticking us on a bus for half of our trip but didn’t let us know it was a bus ticket until we checked in. Staff at the airport were super rude as well, so overall an upsetting experience.",-1
2023-07-12,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Phoenix,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3,customer experience is not important,True,"  I think, it would be a very beneficial eye opening experience for Scott Kirby to fly as a regular customer during bad weather conditions. Spend time in a long line for the travel assistance for rebooking the flight, and then trying to figure out where to spend a night or few nights before the next flight. I was coming from a wonderful European vacation on July 9th. As soon as I arrived to the Newark airport, I received a very unwelcome message that my connecting flight was canceled. The next 4 hours were extremely frustrating. The United App was not working. Long line to the travel assistance full of frustrated customers, elderly people, and parents with young crying children kept growing. A travel agent informed me that a seat for me is available no earlier than July 12th. I registered for the standby for the earliest flight the next day as well. I, as every other person in that line, needed to find a place to spend a night, possibly 3 nights. The agent was kind enough to give me 3 vouchers $15 each. I am a full time employee and have responsibilities. So, I had to inform my manager about my encounter. The next day I spent “camping out” at the Newark airport on a standby list. The overbooking practices help maximize the profits and brings hefty bonuses to the top management of the airline at the expense of their customers. In Europe airlines are penalized with high fines for overbooking. The airline should be able to develop a backup plans for bad weather, and not use it (bad weather) as an excuse for inconvenience, keeping travelers stranded for days, passing down the operating cost to customers. Seems like customer experience is not important for United airlines.",1
2023-07-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Toronto,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,stuck in Newark Airport for over 40 hours,True,"  I was stuck in Newark Airport for over 40 hours, due to a flight cancellation. Rebooked in for a new flight, 40+ hours was the wait. Newark was my connecting flight location. Toronto was my final destination. Before finding out about my cancelled connected flight, my check in baggage was rechecked in. Since I was spending over 40 hours in the airport, I spoke to United Baggage Counter Service 3 TIMES! To know the whereabouts of my bag, and I wanted it with me during my wait in the Airport. The 1st time, I was told that even though my bag was rerouted, I could collect it and have it with me, then I could recheck it in before boarding my new flight to Toronto. I was told to do this by visiting baggage service the next day. The next day is here, it is my 2nd time. I was told it'll take 12 hours for me to retrieve it, ""look out for it at carousel 9"" I was told. And I could recheck it in. The 3rd and final time I spoke to Baggage Counter Service, this person behind the counter told me something completely different, he said that since my bag has been rerouted, I no longer have access to it until my final destination. And I was PROMISED that it will be with me on my new Toronto flight. 3 times, with 3 different answers. Saying that, luckily I saw my bag on carousel belt 9, attached with the reroute label and all. I picked it up to get my phone charger which I really needed. I asked one of the baggage workers if I could keep my bag with me and I will recheck it in myself. They said NO. It's in the system, and it's guaranteed to be with you. I finally landed in Toronto and not only did my bag not show up, but I found out that it's still in Newark Airport! I know this because United Baggage service in Toronto tracked it for me. Having been already frustrated waiting around for 40+ hours, now I have to deal with another problem. Again, I was guaranteed that it will be with me. I've already made arrangements to get it delivered to an address, it'll take 2-3 days for me to receive it.",-1

I had to reroute to a different destination airport in order to attend the meeting I was flying to attend. Note my ticket cost over $1,900. I am 6’2 and can tell from sitting up in the plane that I am the tallest person on the flight. I asked the counter if they needed anyone for an exit row she lied and said they were completely full. On the plane they asked costumers to move to the exit seat as it was not full. I asked if I could and was dismissed. Every time I fly United there are delay issues. I do not recommend united!",-1

I will never fly with this company ever again! Maybe instead of paying people $5/hr in another country that can’t help anyone or has no permission to do anything you should invest in actual US customer service that you pay $30+/hr,-1

Everything about the flight was excellent. Cabin service was very friendly and efficient. The meal was surprisingly tasty, given past experiences on United, especially. Although we took off a bit late, we landed in DC early. I liked the service oriented attitude of the crew. Even the pilot's announcements were timely and informative. All in all, a very good experience.",1
2023-07-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,Tucson to Texas,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst costumer service I’ve ever experienced,True, This was the worst experience I have ever had. My family and I purchased tickets for first class meaning we paid an extra $800 just for the airline to refuse our seats and sit us in economy because they “don’t have availability”. If they didn’t have any available seats then why was I charged and the worst part of all of it was they gave a free upgrade to a couple to sit in first class the day of the flight! It’s free for them because I paid for it! The customer service phone line was a complete waste of time seeing as they did nothing for us. On our return flight home it took us almost two hours trying to get our bags checked because of the ticket situation even after calling the “help” line. Every single person we have talked to has been nothing but rude. Please save your money and sanity by never flying with United! The absolute worst costumer service I’ve ever experienced anywhere!,-1

Over 4 days of wasted vacation time, 2 flight cancellations, zero help from costumer service. Upon our arrival from TLV to Phoenix via Newark the flight from Newark airport was cancelled, and then cancelled again and again.  Leading to 4 whole days of waiting, missing out on precious family vacation time. Upon our arrival from Phoenix via Chicago to TLV our flight from Chicago got cancelled, no other flights for 2 days.

Arrived on flight - hostess had allocated our assigned seats prior to take off. They then proceeded re-shuffle everyone around again causing absolute chaos. Flight was delayed. No liquids (water or anything else) was offered until 2.5 hours into flight. No entertainment - screen was broken - 55 C. They had run out of any option on food and issued a vegetable offering which we sent back After explaining the circus they were running they offered compensation which was refused.,-1
2023-07-09,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Vancouver via San Francisco,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,4,trip was an unmitigated disaster,True,"  I have flown United Airlines and its Star Alliance partners many times. However, this trip was an unmitigated disaster. Our departure to SFO was delayed by 3 hours because the flight crew was delayed getting in to DFW and needed their 8 hour rest. This meant we would miss our connection. As it turned out, the connecting flight was cancelled. The agent at check in would not rebook us on another airline nor put us on standby. Our bags were checked through to YVR. The agent in the United Club put us on standby for the next flight from SFO. Unfortunately, we could not get on this flight nor 2 other flights that we were on standby status. As a result, I ended up booking one way flights on another carrier to Seattle, stayed overnight and then took the bus to YVR so we could attend the first of 4 wedding events. The flight itself was fine; however, the baggage is another story. Our bags never made it to YVR. I spent countless hours texting with United Baggage over 5 days. We received conflicting messages about our bags being in YVR. We missed a pre-wedding soiree because we spent 4 1/2 hours at YVR airport looking for a bag that wasn't there and had to buy every day clothes plus clothes for the wedding. On Monday July 3, I received a phone call saying one bag as in YVR. I requested the bag to be delivered to our hotel. On the day of departure from YVR, the bag still hadn't arrived. I received a call while going through security that 2 bags would be sent to DFW and delivered to our home address. The bags were delivered to our home on Friday July 7. The garment bag that was supposed to be delivered to our hotel before departure on 7/6 is still in United's baggage system. 24-48 hr delay is excusable; however an entire 8 day vacation without baggage is totally inexcusable. This is the first time in all my years of travel I have encountered such poor baggage service. I'm inclined to not use United again, but then I would lose my Premier access status with its Star Alliance partners. I would reluctantly recommend United as I have never had this issue before.",1

United canceled my flight at 3:30am in the mourning while in route to airport. Couldn't make contact with an agent to help us, tried to rebook a flight for next day on their app and flights were at 1,500 or per person. I was traveling with my wife, daughter and 2 dogs. I've been trying to get a refund because I had to spend over double the amount for tickets through JET BLUE. Flew into JFK instead of Newark, taxi was almost $200 to get home. Reached out to United customer service as instructed by their associate after a hour Waite on the phone and no one has responded.  I don't think I will ever fly united ever again.

2023-07-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Atlanta to Aalborg,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1,no one knew where my bags were,True," Departure flight: Firstly, let me express I live in Atlanta, GA. We have one of the largest Airports in America, therefore, I understand the 2 hours plus rule. From the time I arrived in Newark, it was a terrible choice. My first leg on United Airlines was ATL to EWR, I arrived to Hartsfield Airport (ATL) to discover my flight would be 1 hour and 45 mins delayed. Not a big deal to most but I had a connecting flight to Denmark, Europe. As it got closer to the boarding time, an United assistant began to yell on the microphone, ""Y'all have to hurry and board or we will go illegal and you will have to wait longer"". If anyone came up to ask a question, ""Y'all have to hurry and board because we are about to go illegal"". She informed us, they would start boarding sooner due to them about to go ""illegal"". Finally, we are all boarded on the plane, we waited an extra 30 mins to taxi due to them allowing another United flight that was supposed to depart at 10ish pm to board our flight, they said we were not full so they could get more passengers on my flight. While this delay occurred because we have multiple people with the same seat. These genius people did not think about this. Secondly, I arrived at Newark, and it takes United 30 mins to get an associate to hook up a ramp for passenger departure of the aircraft. The pilot continues to apologize over the microphone several times. I literally had 5 mins to get to my connecting flight; it was pointless to even run during this time. I reached the United help desk to informed them I'd missed my connecting flight due to their delay, the woman assisted me by trying to get the next available flight but all of them made me miss my anniversary, which is the day I would have arrived to be with my spouse. At this point, they give me a hotel because I had an international flight. I asked several times if my bags would be on the new flight I'd been given, the United assistant reassured me they would. (It was not on my next flight after delayed for 10 hours.) The assistant gave me a meal voucher of $15 for breakfast and lunch. They provided a Lyft to the hotel, by this time, it was 12 am. The hotel was about a 20 min drive, and I felt like I'd passed a million hotels to arrive at such an unsatisfying one. You would have thought I was in a motel 6. After a 10-hour delay, I started my travel back to Newark (EWR), my international flight was on time, I was so happy to be away from this unprofessional airport. The staff was horrible going through security check out. I arrived to Aalborg, Europe to discover, no one knew where my bags were. I'd missed my anniversary and now I have absolutely No clothes. Returning flight: From Aalborg, Europe (AAL) to dreadful Newark (EWR), I arrived at Newark Airport (EWR) again but this time I had an 8-hour layover. I'd learned from my first experience to just take the extra time if you can. I put myself into the Newark International Airport Marriott, which is only 5 mins from the Airport. Trust me, I could tell the difference of this hotel as I arrived in the parking lot. The next morning, I started my travels.",-1
2023-07-02,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Honolulu via Houston,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,an epic disappointment,False," To start off this was my husband’s and I’s first time flying United and it was an epic disappointment. We arrive 2 hours early here in Birmingham to be told your flight here has been delayed and you will miss your connecting flight in Houston to Los Angeles. You have the choice to stay here in Birmingham or fly to Houston and we will provide a hotel room. Okay we chose to fly to Houston because who knows what could happen. We end up in a storm in Houston no fault to United Airlines but the issue is we lost a day in Honolulu and our room there was already paid for no refund issued. So we fly 7 1/2 hours straight to Honolulu on a crowded flight having to sit in the middle when our seats were originally by the window. So I didn’t get the beautiful view of what I wanted to see. The food was terrible because we received a salad no dressing and I was thankful we ate dinner. The flight back wasn’t even better. We got delayed in Los Angeles because the flight attendant was late in Honolulu. Then we go to customer service and they did accommodate us at another hotel with food vouchers. However the experience was horrible because most of the staff was rude and disingenuous on how to handle customers. Things could have been worse but paying for baggage, being re-seated on every flight was all too much and even with them putting us up in hotels. We still lost money and a day in Honolulu. I say this to say we stayed humble through the experience but it was still not enough to repay for our losses. Also on the flight home from Houston there was no wi-fi service so that sucked. Y’all ask if I would refer you all to others as a last resort but no.",1
2023-07-02,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Liberia to Houston,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Again United failed,False,"  Again United failed. 1st flight canceled, rebooked stanby and that flight delayed and full, so had to cancel the trip. Rebook it all and try again. Taxi costs to and from the airport, paid cancellation fees to hotels and rental car companies, but United doesn't care. Never mind the lost time and all the people that also had to reschedule because we couldn't make it. United doesn't care. I understand there are problems from time to time, but at United there are problems ALL the time. Can't remember the last time it went smoothly and I regret the day I joined Mileage Plus, but United doesn't care.",-1
2023-07-02,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to LaGuardia via Washington,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,really comfortable and peaceful,True,  Flight from Edinburgh to La Guardia via Dulles was really comfortable and peaceful. So many inflight entertainment available. Though the flight was a noon flight delicious lunch meal was served and prior to landing cheese ham sandwich was passed out. Delayed flight arrival to LGA was about 30 minutes late but with quick boarding the flight took off 40 minutes again. Gate staff was updating about the delay every 20 minutes. United has always been good to me. I was on a Basic Economy class.,1
2023-07-01,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Omaha to Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,This time is the final straw,True,"  Once again United Airlines found a way to delay my flight. This time they aid the flight was delayed because the crew was coming in on another flight, after a few hours they then said they were waiting on a flight attendant. Every time I book United I’m delayed. This time is the final straw, I missed a very important family event that I can never get back or see again.",-1

2023-06-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Chicago,,,,,,1.0,1,unreliable and unprofessional airline,False,"  This airline is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I took off work to go to Chicago to celebrate a religious holiday with my family and was met with a bunch of problems. First, my flight at 5:40 was canceled just hours before it was supposed to take off. I decided to go at 3 to wait on standby for the next flight to Chicago at 4:45, which is what was recommended on the phone by United Customer Service. I was 6th in line. The 4:45 one left and I was unable to get in. I waited for one at 7:30 but was also unable to get in. However, by that time, they told me that I am 2nd in line and had to wait 4 more hours for the next flight. I found out about an hour before the next flight at 11 that I was kicked off the waiting list for no reason. I tried to find anyone from United to speak to about this but there was absolutely no one there to help. One of the later flights at 11:30 kept getting delayed till about 1 in the morning, and as for the other flight, I was informed that I was, once again, the 6th in line. I spent 9 hours in the airport yesterday and I am sure United does not care about me or a lot of their other customers in my same situation. This is an unreliable and unprofessional airline who do not care for its customers.",-1
2023-06-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,keep cancelling everyone’s flights,False," My family and me were supposed to go to Florida on Wednesday, we were at the airport waiting, it was almost time to board the plane but they delayed it. They delayed it twice!! Then after delaying it they canceled it. They didn’t have anymore flights until Friday so we waited, we woke up at 6 am to go to the airport just to find out they canceled it again. Every time they just say “go to customer service” or to “additional services” but the lines are huge. No one wants to wait there and take time out of their day just for them to reschedule the flight and then cancel it the day before or the day of the flight. Worst part is that they sent out our luggage to Orlando while we are still in Houston. So now we were left without luggage even though United Airlines told us that they will not send our luggage until we are sent out to Florida but come to find out they sent it out either way. So we are left without a plane ride to Florida and we have no luggage. I do not recommend this airline to any one. Crazy how United Airlines is supposed to be the best airline but they keep cancelling everyone’s flights and have horrible customer service.",-1
2023-06-29,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Tokyo Haneda,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2,plane was late leaving EWR,True,"  I really don't have words to describe the stress, cost and disruption caused to my life from United these past few days. I can only summarize on what is clearly the root cause, and it comes down to corporate greed by United. Today our plane was late leaving EWR, as the plane did not have enough fuel. 2 weeks earlier on another United flight the delay was because the crew had slept in. That was just the beginning, in what is a saga of bad planes, bad food (business class), shoddy cheap airport facilities.  Its beyond apparent that United are all about squeezing every last cent of of the business, with a short term view on juicing share price.",-1
2023-06-29,0.1,Business,First Class,Houston to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,fleet is old and trash,True," I booked this flight (UA2394) months in advance, selecting it because it was a non stop and a B737max. They then cancel this flight at 10:30pm the night before the flight, on a holiday weekend leaving me without many options. I had upgraded my seats to first class which I will now lose if I'm selected for standby more than likely not to mention its a poorer 737-800. I was going for a friends wedding. Not only have they now ruined this wedding they try and stick me on standby on a one stop flight, surely losing my first class seat without refunding my paid upgrade no doubt. I don't care what they say about weather or traffic control their airlines is trash. The way they treat their loyal customers is trash. Their fleet is old and trash. Their food is poor. Their loyalty program is terrible because they have too many 1k'ers. You pretty much have to pay for an upgrade if you want one. I finally got a flight on one of their FEW newer planes and they cancel it. I'm going to get on every review site I can think and tell people to fly Delta. They are at least more reliable and probably have a newer fleet and may very well treat their loyalty customers better. United is a greedy airline.",-1
2023-06-29,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tampa,3.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,She gave us an excellent service,True,  I want to thank Claire on the united airlines check- in desk of San Francisco Airport. She gave us an excellent service very professional she is a very kind lady. We where having a very bad day because we missed our fly with another airline and the other airline gave us a reservation instead of a confirmed ticket with United. But Claire told us what to do with the other airline and finally we are home (after 21 hours at 4 different airports and 3 different planes). Thanks Claire. God bless you.,1
2023-06-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tel Aviv,,,,,,1.0,1,do not fly United,True,"  We had book a 10 day vacation to Israel. We were first delayed in the Salt Lake Airport for 8 1/2 hours, missing our connection by several hours and being forced to stay in San Francisco for about 16 hours until the next flight from there left to Tel Aviv. Now, this by itself was very frustrating and meant we would miss a whole day of our vacation, no vacation and no work meant we were losing money by the hour, add onto that was the unhelpful attitude of the flight crew, the several different reasons given for delays (ranging from weather to flight crew deficiency, to plane malfunctions) and this was just a really bad day. We stay in San Francisco for an entire day and are back at the airport for the new flight. Now, the airline did provide us with a hotel (pretty bad one that smelled like smoke) and a few food vouchers, but we weren't very happy with them. The next flight gets delayed again and again until finally at about 2am (was supposed to leave at 8), they cancel the flight for another set of ambiguous reasons. at this point, there are 400+ angry people waiting in one line with about 2 agents and they are turning people away without so much as a hotel room. At this point we decided we would not be flying United, we've missed two days of vacation or work, we've been treated poorly and compensated only the bare minimum. We finally speak to an agent and demand monetary compensation as well as a refund for the cancelled flight (airlines are required to refund cancelled flights), and they refuse. They tell us there will be compensation but where, when, how is left ambiguous. We ended up flying Delta, completely smooth as wonderful process. Though we continually call, fill out forms, send emails, and the like, we have yet to see a dime of compensation for this truly terrible experiences. We stayed in touch with some other people on our flight and they continued to have problems with United (missed connections and the like) and were never compensated. The best that they were able to do was offer $300 vouchers for another flight. Are you kidding me? You think a silly $300 voucher could make up for the money we lost and the horrible experience we had? Not likely. As we are never planning to fly United again, a voucher is honestly just an insult at this point. We also heard that the employees of United are so disgruntled with the company that they are planning a strike. Do yourselves a favor and do not fly United.",-1
2023-06-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Tel Aviv,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,hunt in order to get my luggage,False,  They don't hire enough customer service and staff. It has taken me over 3 days so far in the process of trying to retrieve my luggage. They canceled a flight so I could not get to my connecting flight. However they sent my luggage to the country where I was to get the connection to my final destination. Customer service gave me wrong information twice regarding my luggage. It takes hours to get in touch with customer service. In one attempt it was literally seven hours. When you finally do they give you the wrong information. This happened multiple times. They sent me on a full on scavenger hunt in order to get my luggage. And I still haven't gotten it. United must be held accountable for their negligence. I have spent hours of time energy on trying to locate my luggage. When I went back to the airport as I was incorrectly instructed the air port was operating like a third world countries. Very few staff member and not well trained. There has literally bean financial loss.,-1
2023-06-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nassau to Montreal via Newark,3.0,,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1,lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive,True,"  I am one of the unlucky souls who booked a flight with United in late June 2023. I had to end my vacation in the Caribbean to return to Canada for a family emergency. What was supposed to be an 9h trip turned into a four day nightmare that cost me upwards of $2800 USD in out of pocket expenses, in addition to the original ticket price. I was shocked to find some United employees incredibly lacking in empathy and extremely aggressive. On day three of the ordeal, a customer service rep at Newark took a cursory look at my booking, claimed I was rebooked on an air Canada flight and was “no longer a United passenger.” I told her, the booking was not complete and Air Canada had explained (after I had gone back and forth between the two long queues) that United had not actually booked me, it was more of a temporary hold. The United staff refused to even speak to me, even as I begged tears streaming down my face explaining I had a family emergency. A manager then aggressively threatened to call security if I didn’t step aside because I “had already used up 30 minutes of their time,” which she knew was a blatant lie. I then had to go back to Air Canada and then called United on the phone, all of which was useless. I finally booked myself on a new ticket, via the United app, travelled to another terminal (C) and waited for 8 hours only to have that trip cancelled as well. I was now approaching day 4 so feeling utterly defeated, I booked myself a business class ticket home from Newark with Air Canada. It cost me $2300 USD and was a red eye with a long layover in Quebec City, but that flight DID make it and I’m now home. I think United deserves to be sued for its failure to support and look after the wellbeing of its customers. Shame on them and on lawmakers who allow this level of negligence and disregard for passengers’ wellbeing (see reports of the atrocious conditions in some terminals especially Newark terminal C). I will never travel with United or through the US again for that matter.",-1

2023-06-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Edinburgh via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,horrifically rude and unprofessional,True," United is the most disgusting and horrifically rude and unprofessional airline I have ever dealt with. They left my young children to sleep on the floor of EWR claiming they didn’t have hotels to put us in after 37 hours of delays and cancelling our flight with us on the plane at 2am. They never gave us food vouchers to eat in any of the 37 hours of delays, they didn’t rebook us, they did nothing just said there was nothing they could do and left myself and my 3 kids alone in NYC with absolutely zero help or guidance. Their supervisors laughed at me and said my kids would sleep find on the floor of the airport when I asked if we get a hotel because they cancelled our flights due to their crew scheduling issues.",-1

2023-06-28,0.2,Business,First Class,Newark to Orange County,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,seat was nothing like first,True,"  I had a first class round trip ticket. My flight from SNA TO Newark was delayed due to the pilot. They didn’t have pilot! After 30 minutes delays that was not an issue for me it flew. My First class seat was nothing like first. The seat was small and my legs had no support, seats were not even half way reclined which was the most important point for me to book a first class ticket. Food was good and no claim regarding that. The worst part of my journey was the second ticket from Newark to SNA that was cancelled due to the Weather while other flights had no issue regarding that. I tried to call them, they put me on hold and no answer. I tried to book another ticket they all got booked in a minute. I had flight insurance that did not help me in this situation! The first available ticket was for two days later. Me and my sister had no place to stay since she was moving out of NYC and she returned her home keys. We had to book a hotel, move all of our stuff there. I had job interview that I lost that opportunity due to this cancellation. I was so lucky to get a new first class ticket from American Airlines and reach Orange County safely.",-1
2023-06-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely appalling service,True,"  Absolutely appalling service from United Airlines. Our family has flown with UA the past 2 decades and this had to be one of the most shockingly bad customer services that we have ever received from an airline. Our flight UA441 was scheduled to depart from EWR at 11:07 am and arrive at FLL at 2:16 pm. Then it said on the screen that the flight was delayed 3 hours due to staff issues where it said there was no cabin crew or captain/pilot available for the flight. I understood about the issue carefully and listened to all communications from UA provided to customers. Our vacation to Florida, absolutely ruined due to the bad customer services we have received from United Airlines. We are currently searching for alternatives to make up for the cancelled flight. We will never fly United Airlines again.",-1
2023-06-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Orange County,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,We will never trust this airline,True,"  I had a flight from NYC to Orange County (SNA). My flight got cancelled because of weather. I tried to call them to reschedule my flight. They put me on hold for hours, at the same time I was trying to book a new flight online. There were some options but all others got booked while I was filling the online forms. I kept calling them for hours no answer! My sister had the first class ticket with the United Airlines at the same date and time. Same thing happened to her. We had no place to stay so we had to get taxi and book a hotel for two days. Moreover, we had to pay extra for each time using UBER and food. Finally we were able to book tickets with American Airlines. It means weather is not the reason for this chaotic situation. This was the last time our family book tickets with United Airlines. We will never trust this airline!",-1
2023-06-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Burbank,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United has lost a customer for life,True,"  I was charged $1300 for the round trip ticket to attend my grandfather's funeral. All of my flights were delayed (one was because they had no crew), apparently there is no in-flight entertainment offered anymore on United flights, no food offered other than a small bag of pretzels and a cup of water, I was forced to pay $10 for Wi-Fi service that didn't work, and now I've been told United apparently have a new policy in which they don't adjust fares for bereavement travel. When I called customer service, I was forced into using the text messaging option to try to resolve my concerns due to the waiting period to speak to a representative being over 90 minutes. The United representative that I texted with was not only not helpful, but their messages were full of poor grammar, no punctuation (they often wrote paragraphs with no commas or periods or anything...it was just a run-on, nonsensical way of communicating), and a complete lack of willingness to resolve my concern(s). United has lost a customer for life.",-1
2023-06-27,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Melbourne via Charlotte / Los Angeles,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,with absolutely no help,False,"  Our first flight was delayed two hours (for a myriad of reasons, all different from the last) and we were not notified by the United employee when we checked in at the Asheville regional airport. This two hour delay would have resulted in missing our connection and the international flight from LAX to MEL, but we found a flight out of CLT to LAX with absolutely no help from the AVL United employee (he gave us a phone number to call and sent us on our way, saying there was nothing he could do for us, even though he had just finished helping the couple in front of us with the same itinerary delays). Made it to LAX in time to catch the initial flight to MEL after booking the flight ourselves. Made it to our seats only to wind up sitting on the tarmac for two hours due to a flat tire caused by “running over a washer” (read: negligence) on the runway. By the time the tire was fixed, the crew was over their authorized hours, and the flight was canceled. We were told that we would be rebooked to our initial destination (Melbourne), but we were rebooked to Sydney, which is about 539 miles off our initial destination. In order to solve this, we were directed to another United customer service desk where we stood in line for an hour with 50+ United customers dealing with similar “rebooking” issues. It was 2:00 am by the time we were able to talk to a United customer service employee, and good god I wish we hadn’t. For two hours we stood at that counter and did not get a straight answer to our questions, ie.) He told us he booked tickets for our party of 4 on the same alternative route to Melbourne, but when we checked our itineraries, the flights were still destined for Sydney or, to our surprise, Brisbane. When we asked for the tickets to be printed, we were told there were only 2, even though all 4 of us at the counter repeatedly had to remind him there were 4 of us. On top of this, a customer that had been previously helped cut his way in line twice to commandeer Pax’s attention even though we requested he wait so we could have a chance to get our stuff sorted out as well. It was 4:30 am at this time, we were given a motel voucher by Pax, and told we had rooms booked for the night, but when we called the motel to verify, we were informed we had no bookings and there were no rooms available… Cots were eventually provided for customers that didn’t have any options other than spending the night in the airport, only to be collected about an hour and a half later… The United customer service line has been long and slow moving all day already, which indicates that these issues are still persisting, and United is not prioritizing the one thing it needs to: its customers.",-1

First, you can't place the pet carrier under the seat due to the life saver box attached under the seat. Second, the flight attendants and the terminal crew member were extremely rude. They rather ask you to leave the plane than help you find better option or assist you. I never felt so humiliated. When I purchased the tickets for my dog, they should have warned me and I would have booked with different airline. I always fly with my pet, so this will be my last time flying with United. The Miami crew were not that rude compared to San Francisco crew.",-1
2023-06-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a very exhausting three days,False," I would not recommend flying with United. I came here (Newark) on Saturday and was supposed to take the new flight to Miami the same day. The flight got delayed and after a long time cancelled. Then I was sent to a queue for customer service. I stood in line for over nine hours and when I got to the front all they gave me was stand by tickets. Therefore, on Sunday I want all over the airport and the flights I got was it's cancelled or fully booked. I got a ticket for West Palm beach on Monday late at night and I was promised a seat. On Monday when I got to the airport and was supposed to check my luggage in, I saw that the flight had been changed. Instead of having a promised seat they had changed me to a stand by to Miami. there was nothing I could do than to go to that gate and hope for the best. The flight was supposed to go by half eight pm but got delayed to nine pm then eleven pm then one am then three am and in the end the cancelled it and put me on stand by on a flight that was leaving seven am. That flight was fully booked and a long stand by waiting list so I decided to rent a car instead. I have spent three days here at the airport with no good help or any chance of getting out of here. My experience with United was very bad and I hope this makes you not want to take this company. This has been a very exhausting three days and also three days where I was supposed to be on vacation and having a good time, and not sitting waiting for flights just for them to be cancelled or not have a seat for me.",-1

We had to get home so we ended up paying extra. No refunds, no vouchers. Guess what, that next flight was delayed 6 hours because they couldn't find a pilot. Never heard of that.

This trip my flight out of Venice to Newark was canceled, but the second leg from Newark to New Orleans was not. This prevented me from rebooking my flight without waiting 2 hrs for an agent. I was booked two days later, costing over $400.00 euro in hotel costs, no options were offered by the agent. My 6 hr layover was also delayed. As of writing this review, I am still waiting on the second flight to be reassigned to another gate.

I did not reserve a wheelchair but when i arrived in Newark and saw 5+ wheelchairs unused by the gate I asked if I could use one. The United people declined my request.

Flight left and arrived slightly early the cabin crew actually worked the cabin for the flight, not just for the meal service. You must have your own device with the United app downloaded in order to enjoy any entertainment but they made several announcements prior to leaving so we all knew.",1
2023-06-20,0.8,Solo Leisure,First Class,Kona to San Francisco,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5,a decent experience,True," Considering United tends to use their oldest equipment on this route, I had a decent experience. The usual “technical’ delay (broken PA system) delayed us 30 minutes. Aircraft has 2-2-2 seating with flat bed style seats. The food was ok, the service, also ok and the entertainment was quite good. Luggage came quickly and in good shape. Seems like they are trying to improve.",1
2023-06-19,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark,3.0,,5.0,4.0,,2.0,1,we were stuck on the ramp,True," My cousin is walker/wheelchair bound. We waited nearly an hour for a wheelchair to be brought to us to move throughout the Newark Airport one we landed. 20 of those minutes we were stuck on the ramp because there was no way to get him off the plane as even the isle chairs were unavailable. We finally got to the gate after an attendant retrieve an isle chair from who knows where. Due to the long wait my cousin needed to use the restroom, but the gate attendant refused as the isle chair is not for travel throughout the airport. I left after 10 minutes of arguing between the gate and flight attendants (who were helping us) to avoid a serious embarrassment. When we returned, no one was there anymore. Another gate attendant at a different gate made 4 separate calls for chairs not only for my disabled cousin, but another elderly lady also waiting an hour for assistance. We spoke to a manager about this absurd wait. She was apologetic and took our information. I am thankful we decided to fly in a day early for my cousin's medical trials, as this would have caused him to be late for his treatments otherwise.",-1
2023-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Calgary via Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,refused to compensate us,True,"  Shocking treatment by United Airlines of 2 elderly people and an infant, leaving us stranded and paying over $1,000 for hotel + food over the Boston Marathon weekend - and when we filed a complaint, United refused to compensate us even one cent! We were flying from Boston to Calgary, Canada via Newark with my two elderly parents (one of whom has a back problem and gastrointestinal issues) and my 5 month old baby, who was flying for the first time in his life. On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us that the Boston-Newark leg of our journey was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane’s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were informed that the earliest available alternative was not for another two days on April 18th, 2023, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days. They also confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which was within their control. We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary on April 18th. We were appalled that United was not able to re-schedule us for two full days.  Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere. We incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport. Our total additional expenses during our delay period WAS USD 1,110. We filed a detailed complaint with United Customer Care. It took them close to 2 months to reply to us, and when they did they vaguely blamed the weather (first time we heard of this excuse!) and refused to compensate us at all.",-1

I prepaid for 2 suitcases at $30 a piece for a limit of 50 lbs. My wife's luggage was 58 lbs. I was forced to pay $100 for the extra 8 lbs. If I bought a second luggage, it would have been another $40. I fully understand that I have to pay a penalty for extra weight. However, this charge was totally unreasonable. I would expect an extra $25 to $30 for the excess 8 lbs. My wife needs special assistance and carries extra stuff. It looks like I wouldn't be flying ""the friendly skies"" anytime soon.",-1

The customer service was absolutely awful. We were two minutes late for our flight that was running 15 minutes behind schedule. We were not even directly told by the service representative that we were unable to get on before they just rebooked us for another flight. No one communicated with us that we could have still gotten on our plane if we didn’t check a car seat. Management was super disrespectful and again not communicative. We would not have minded being rescheduled if we had even been asked or told that it was happening before being handed a boarding pass for a flight four hours later. United airlines wants to stick to the policy that wasn’t on my booking, but has to be looked up on the website to find.",-1

If your UA travel includes international partners and your fare includes advanced seat selection, know that you very well may not be able to select seats on those partner airlines without paying additional fees. UA does disclose this under their website's FAQ area (rather buried) but totally does not disclose this when the ticket is purchased. If traveling with others and sitting together is important, such as for long overseas flights, then know that for UA partner airlines you will probably have to pay more for advanced seat selection. A bit of a bait-and-switch, not getting what was advertised. Shame!",-1

2023-06-15,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,canceled my return flight back,True,"  Checking in with United Airlines is awful, had to wait a very long time for my ticket to print out. Then they canceled my return flight back a number of two times. I had to extend my stay, take off more days of work so I can get on the next plane which wasn’t until three days later. Three days before my return flight home they canceled that one and made it the next day. Meanwhile I had already booked accommodation for an extra three days. Therefore I had to cancel the whole return flight in total because the new date that they were flying out was the next day after the original. This airline will play around, making you spend more money than necessary, and I already made a vow not to ever fly with United. It’s cheaper to fly with quality airlines and pay 2k than to pay 1k with United, $200+ in extra hotels, and 2k on another ticket back home that’s not with United. Not to mention, the dinner served on overnight flights are nasty, and it’s impossible to sleep in economy, the only thing that was good was the Diet Coke. Other than that the flight attendants were nice",-1

The flight from Chicago to Frankfurt was very disappointing. We were in a row near the end of the plane. Our first encounter with cabin staff was a flight attendant throwing the earbuds at us instead of passing them down. Staff barely stopped to hear a reply from customers when asking if we wanted water or beverages and no one stopped to take garbage before take-off. The most disappointing was the meal service. They prepared just enough meals for the entire flight but by the time they got to our rows near the back of the flight, they were only providing the vegetarian meal which was bland and featured a strange salad. I don't know when they ran out of other meal options but they served this to at least 50 or more passengers. The in-flight Wi-Fi worked at the beginning and end but was not available during the middle of the flight..",-1

Service is mediocre at best. I took the flight from Chicago to Rome and Barcelona going back to Chicago, with a total mileage of 9,000+. United Airlines' MileagePlus gave me 4,000+ mileage. Not only do they suck at service and making the flight on time, they also choke their MileagePlus customer. Stay AWAY from United Airlines!",-1

Our direct flight has been cancelled just 1 hour before departure. After long waiting united offered 2 options: to flight 2 days later with 1 transfer, or flight 1 day later with 2 transfers. They do not care about this delay and the fact we have to change flights. We had economy plus seats, they were unable to book us to this class again, we landed in economy class. Our travel has been delayed by 36 hours and did not get any compensation for the missed time, scheduled working days and the 3 flights instead of the direct flight. The service line did not do anything for us.",-1

2023-06-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Denver,,,,,,,1,I'll never fly United Airlines,True,"  My flight was booked with rewards miles and United Airlines cancelled the flight due to weather. That was in December 2022 and it's now June 2023 and I still don't have a refund from United Airlines for the cancelled flights. My rewards agent has been trying to get the credit for a few months now and she's received a few different excuses why it hasn't been done yet. So my review isn't based on my flight, and I'll never fly United Airlines. It's based on how long my issue is mired in whatever miscommunications there are. Scores are the lowest I can provide on this review and in all fairness, I wasn't privy to anything experiences of the flight",-1

These airlines lie, treat you like sheep, bouncing around from one gate to another. Lost my first class upgrade on rebooking, didn't give me my plus points back. United's mileage plus program stinks, you cant get upgraded without using your plus points, paying cash or using your miles. Their food sucks, mostly vegan, their fleet is nearly the oldest. If you’re going to give your loyalty to an airlines do delta. They are more reliable. United treats the passengers terribly as well as their status customers.",-1

No refund offered, not her fault! Sign said gate closes 10 minutes before flight we arrived 12 minutes and it was “ just closing.” Other passengers also told same thing, same tone of rudeness.",-1

I have had the hardest time getting a hold of literally anyone to figure this out since December 2022. I finally get a resolution 3 weeks ago and get told you are only sending a check of $700 to compensate for everything that was lost and the long wait time. The check arrived today in the mail and went to deposit it in my account and I can't even deposit it because of issues with the check. Now after all day of trying to reach someone and I finally get a hold of someone I am told that you will void this check and so now have to wait another 30 days for a different check. We are currently in June and I'm still being dicked around for not even a quarter of the money for how much I have lost in December!,-1

2023-06-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to London,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,customer service is horrendous,False,"  If you like to be disappointed, united should be the airline of choice. Their customer service is horrendous. If you need to clarify something before traveling, I'd recommend not actually asking anyone because that interaction will make it worse. I had reached out on my recent flight as a Star Alliance gold member to see if I had access to the United Lounges - this was pre-planning. I was told yes and planned accordingly. Then when I arrived at the first United Lounge, I was told no I didn't have access by the rudest agent I've ever spoken to. Fast forward then to after I went and got food, coffee and so on, I went to another lounge to clarify. This agent then confirmed I do get access. Quite literally, every person I spoke to gave me a different answer. This continues. I had reached out to customer service regarding my seat selection. I was told one thing, then when I went to confirm again, I was again told something else which left me frustrated. All of this leading up to traveling with a family just makes things unnecessarily stressful. I went to the desk to make my frustration known and was told by the most lifeless representative that I can use the QR code to contact customer support. That chat, and the one on the app, couldn't even load. All that said, it just boils down to United Airlines culture of not caring.",-1

My husband had a medical issue related to pneumonia and shortness of breath. The stewardesses sent an announcement for a medical volunteer to assist. A nurse came forward and took vitals to make sure he was okay. She stayed with him until we needed to land. One of the stewardesses gave my husband an oxygen mask and took info from me. She coordinated with the nurse to provide needed aid. Don’t know the nurses name but want to thank her for being courageous in volunteering. Both the nurse and stewardess watched over my husband, stayed with him and secured a Paramedic team to escort him off the plane. The paramedics removed him from the aircraft while all passengers stayed seated until we could whisk him away. Thank you all for your patience and well wishes. He had to be intubated once they got him down to the ambulance. He was really grasping for air. My husband has been admitted to a local hospital and was diagnosed with pneumonia and put on a ventilator. 24 hours later he is stable and off the ventilator. I wanted to express my gratitude and appreciation for everyone on this United Airlines flight who tended to my husbands needs. The staff was very professional, trained to tackle medical needs and keep me calm in the process. Thank you!",1

After we were already aboard the plane, they proceeded to mess around for over an hour and eventually were not able to fix it, So at that point, we had to get off the plane with our luggage and then we had to wait nearly an HOUR AND A HALF for a replacement plane to be available. It was a ridiculous amount of delay and led to me missing my connecting flight altogether. I am so disgusted with United that I will never use them again if I can help it.",-1

My first flight was cancelled and I was stranded in Norfolk for 24 hours. No hotel was provided. I arrived in London 27 hours late, no compensation was offered. The reason for first flight cancellation was weather-related, but there was no major weather alert ongoing (it was very rainy on the East cost with alert for small aircraft), and flights from Norfolk to New York of all other companies (American Airlines and Delta) were delayed but flying. Arriving 27 hours late with not even hotel/meal voucher is just not acceptable.",-1

Very unfortunate, because Continental was among the best before the United/Continental merger. If you have another option, do yourself a favor and take it. My current gripe is after being stranded by them in Boston (not weather related) they want $109.00 to move to one of 20 empty seats (not first class) 15 minutes before departure. What would it cost them to be accommodating? It cost me $350 for a last minute hotel and Uber due to their poor performance.",-1

I was assigned to United via Air Canada. I wasn't sure of the arrangement in the beginning but very glad I got the chance to fly United. Pros: 1) Friendly flight attendant - someone was sitting in my spot. A friendly flight attendant stepped in immediately and resolved the situations for me. 2) Good in flight service - full can of soda pop was offered to me. That was a treat. 3) Fast flight - we left the gate 5 minutes ahead of schedule and arrive 30 minutes early. 4) Speedy luggage retrieval - I got off the plain and my luggage was already at the carousel waiting for me. This is the fastest that I have ever seen. 5) Excellent value for the service and I will definitely fly United again. Cons: none.,1

While sitting there, none of the promised services were available and the in flight entertainment consisted of theee movies. Laughable. Problem 1: after getting off the plane we were exiting the terminal and the attendant was beyond rude. She acted like we were completely stupid for being confused and not knowing what to do. She never offered help. Problem 2: after thirty minutes of people sitting in the terminal and on the floor, they finally announced the flight would now be leaving in four hours.There are no concessions for anyone with a disability either. You are on your own. So to sum it up, spent $1000 to fly to Washington. United took that money and gave me the worst service I have ever experienced. Not only will I never consider a flight with this airline again.",-1

I had a horrible experience when I checked in for my flight Tuesday morning May 30th at 4am in Portland PDX Airport. When I check in though Tuesday morning to my Flight at 4am the staff told me that I need to check in My backpack and pay $35 fee for it. I paid the fee and then she told me that I need to check in the bag. I didn't do that because that's why I travel light. So she told me that I need to consolidate my purse with backpack. I did that also at 4am my flight taking off at 5am. After I executed all her orders another United employee asked me if I wanted a refund for my $35 charges for backpack. I didn't got my money back. I been through all that at 4am in a strange state even though I didn't have a issue with my belongings when I flew in Friday May 26 but I had 5 days later on May 30th .

Compared to Qatar Business Class, Swiss Business Class, Even Aer Lingus Business Class, United really fails! The catering was absolutely terrible on United! The manner of the service is like coach class. The flight attendants were fine but look like being on board was the last place they wanted to be. This is in contrast to the genuinely happy, attentive and polite flight attendants on Qatar Airways. United has finally added a mattress pad to cover the seats which is common sense but UA did not offer this for a long time. Thus it was like sleeping on a bed that thousands of people had slept in. The food quality and service on plastic tray was classless! The worst being the food quality. Also, I a 6'1"" slim but could not bend my knees up when on my side as the bed width was too narrow. I was really disappointed with United Polaris Business. They fall very short of the international competition. I will not be flying them again anytime soon!",-1

I will do my best to find alternatives, or at least give them less money if I feel the value or respect for customers are lacking. But they do not care.",-1
2023-05-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Buenos Aires to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,proves again to be the worst US airline,True,"  United proves again to be the worst US airline. Full international flight Buenos Aires to Newark; after everyone is boarded and sitting, they realize the engine is not working; for 4 hours, everyone is sitting on the plane without AC, the crew gives no guidance. At 1 am, Chicago finally decides that the flight cannot depart; they send all passengers home. As most don't have accommodations, they tell us to get any hotel, which will be reimbursed along with expenses. 24hs later, everyone is back with a day of our lives wasted to the rebooked version of the original flight. This time the door of the crew's bathroom isn't working. We wait again sitting in the plane for 3 hours.  I arrived home 48hs after I left in what should have been an 11hr flight. When contacting the airline, they tell us they actually will not honor the cost of our overnight stay due to the canceled flight but only 200$, a fraction of the cost of an additional day stranded abroad. No one responds, no one cares.",-1

Went to our baggage claim. Stood near the bag drop. 2.5 hour flight. We received one bag and the other is unknown. The system is garbage, and the staff are no help. This is obviously not a problem because you’re making too much money to not care about passengers.",-1

However our lovely check in lady was so pleasant and recognised this after I explained it to her. We were at just over 51 pounds for our 4 bags. The plane was fine, clean, nice seat, good storage and decent screen for IFE. The seriously bad issue was the food. Our starter was overcooked disgusting noodles served with an odd dressing. Left uneaten. Absolutely dreadful, mushed potatoes, dry tasteless chicken and worst of all rotten, mushed broccoli. I showed this to the nice stewardess. Mostly left uneaten. Dessert was a biscuit for a child. Left uneaten. Wines were mixed. Good and bad. No cheese, no proper dessert no proper salad. United, you need to have a serious word with your caterers.",-1
2023-05-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Kahului via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,customer service is bad,True, Ground personnel was rude. They charged $35.00 per carry on when they say that in most of their flights they allow carry on free. The check in process is through machines and customer service is bad. All this process happened in Fort Lauderdale station.,-1
2023-05-24,0.8,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Honolulu to San Francisco,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,wouldn't mind choosing United again,True,"  My flight from Honolulu to San Francisco faced an 18 hour delay. However the situation was handled pretty well, albeit it could've been handled better. Check in at Honolulu airport was confusing, as a Star Gold member I was expecting to find a separate premier access line, turns out they herd all passengers into the same area and have a small sign at the end of the area saying ""Premier access."" Not very helpful considering I had to check in with a machine even though I could've checked in at the counter. The agent at the counter was very helpful and verified my ID before I went through security and to the HNL United club. As far as United clubs go, this one isn't too bad, with great views of the airport, hot and cold food on offer, and the highlight: a Dole whip soft serve machine. When I went to the face for boarding, I arrived just in time for group 1 boarding, and found a pillow and blanket on my premium plus seat for this red-eye flight. I had paid an extra $215 for this seat which I think is good value, especially for a red-eye. It was basically a narrow-body business class seat, a big lazy-boy if you will. The flight taxied out to the runway, made a turn on to the runway then turned off the runway. The first officer announced that they had an issue with the radio and they would try to troubleshoot it there, however we had to return to the gate as the pilots couldn't troubleshoot it. United messaged us a new departure time of 00:30 (originally 22:30). During the delay, the cabin crew walked up and down the aisles offering water to passengers. At 02:00, the pilots had gone over their duty time and they deplaned all passengers. At the baggage claim, hotel and food vouchers for the Hilton Hawaiian Village as well as taxi vouchers were offered, but they did not announce this and only passengers who came to the service desk got these. The new departure time was set at 12:30, and I went to rest at the Hilton. The food voucher however allowed for only $15 per meal, which got me an orange, coffee and a yoghurt for breakfast. Thankfully with my Gold status I could use the ANA lounge when I returned to the airport and got a full lunch there, however other passengers would've had to pay the excess for their meals. The departure time got pushed back again to 17:15, and we finally pushed back at 17:29. To United's credit, the service onboard from the cabin crew was fantastic. They were genuinely happy to serve passengers and were genuinely happy to be there. The selection of complimentary snacks and beverages was slightly limited but considering the price of the ticket I couldn't complain. I didn't book anything for San Francisco for the first day, so I didn't miss anything. However the new arrival time of 01:30 meant I missed the BART to the city centre and ended up having to pay for an Uber. The return flight on the 757 wasn't as great due to the old cabin. Initially at the check in counter I asked if I could get a seat in economy plus, to which the response was ""$200."" I asked again at the United club and they asked ""is an aisle seat okay for you?"" and got 10D without any extra charge. I think that the way United handled the delay relatively well in my case, although I believe my Thai Airways Gold status helped me stay fed during the delay. I wouldn't mind choosing United again, but I can't speak for all passengers on this incident.",1
2023-05-23,0.1,Business,Economy Class,New Orleans to Houston,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,inform me that I was too late,False,"  I will be flying Southwest from now on. I had a flight to Houston booked for this morning. I showed up to the airport with ample time to check a bag, make it through security, and board my plane, as I have about twice a month with United over the past year. After I wasn't able to check in on the kiosk, I was directed to stand in line and check my bag in manually. Unfortunately, I am not a wealthy, first class customer, so the line I was directed to stand in did not move an inch while the first class line continuously flowed. Over an hour later, I reached a representative. Keep in mind my line was not long, less than 10 travelers total, but if anyone occupied the first class line, regardless of when he/she arrived, that was the priority. So after an hour of waiting and getting pretty antsy because it was getting pretty close to my flight time, I finally reached a representative who proceeded to inform me that I was too late and that she could not check a bag without 45 minutes notice before the flight departure time. So I got to the airport with more than enough time to complete all tasks that I do on a regular basis with United, but because I choose to forego extra leg room and comfier seat on this short flight, I was deprioritized and ultimately forced to miss my flight. Southwest had me booked on a flight leaving an hour and a half later, the check-in and bag drop process were seamless, and I thoroughly enjoyed my flight, despite the stress of missing a meeting because of United's poor customer service. I will be closing my United MileagePlus account, and Southwest will get all of my future business and referrals.",-1
2023-05-23,0.1,Business,Business Class,Guam to Tokyo,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,UA does not care for its corporate customers,True," When I checked in for my flight I was told my seat would be assigned at the gate. When I arrived at the gate the staff made me wait, then they told me that because I used miles to upgrade and the plane was full, that they downgraded me from business to economy. I told them I have a confirmed paid seat through corporate travel and their points explanation was incorrect. So I pushed to get a seat. They then told me that they gave my seat to a UA pilot. I challenged them again and said the pilot should sit in economy, again as I have a confirmed corporate travel booking. Finally after 15 minutes they finally gave in and I was presented a seat in 1E, business class. No explanation was given so I asked. They said a ""standby revenue customer"" had taken my seat. This I felt was unacceptable that they wanted to bump a corporate travel guest to get more money out of a standby customer. The standby customer was moved after boarding, so no doubt they were disgruntled too, and I sat next to the 777 pilot who had been evacuated from Guam before the typhoon. What I don’t understand is that an airline is happy to downgrade its corporate customers to put a pilot in their seat, even though economy is available. I also think it’s greedy to downgrade a corporate customer to take a standby revenue customer, when I had paid through work the full airfare. My understanding is that UA does not care for its corporate customers, ironically likely the ones keeping them in the air! And I booked through a travel agent so I guess UA has total disregard for their travel industry partners. That aside, the staff onboard were nice and did their best with perhaps the worst set of 737s in APAC, old and run down with terrible out dated business class seats. Definitely fly JAL if/when they return or any other airline than UA from Japan to Guam.",-1

They acknowledge that. It has now been two hours and I am still sitting at the gate waiting for a wheelchair to be brought to me.

After every flight was delayed, after repeatedly deplaning and missing connecting flights because of the constant delays, after every part of the trip turning into one 18-hour disaster after another, they gave my seat away to someone else and made me deplane again and wait another 12 hours to get on another flight.

Inconveniencing almost 700 people to catch the 20 that didnt have it signed! They were also asking for people to check their carryon because the flight was full so I pushed a bunch of stuff into my backpack and tried to check it in only to be treated incredibly rudely and then told to get back in the passport line that I was just in for a half an hour. This, lets call her a lady, was rude and obnoxious to countless passengers and ruined my entire day. I was looking forward to this trip for our 30th anniversary! She soured it before we even left DC.

Flew Pittsburgh to Washington. Washington to Atlanta was delayed then canceled. Was offered a flight at 3 pm at another airport, that fell through. Then he said 5pm, again at the Reagan airport. I get a text saying I have a flight to New York the following morning though. What? So I call American airlines, they say my reservation United made for me was actually never made. I was given lift vouchers to go to and from that airport. Now I can't get to Atlanta til tomorrow and had to cancel my vacation.  What an absolute disappointment for my first trip in 6 years. Flying back home in 8 hours though. Lucky me to be stuck at Washington airport and to get screwed by united. What a waste.",-1

I was assured by both airlines that I could check my bag all he way to TLH. Everything was delayed and I arrived in ATL after all Delta flights to TLH had departed. After driving from Atlanta to Tallahassee, discovered my bag was still in ATL. I tried numerous times to get United to transfer the bag to Delta who agreed to fly it on to TLH, but they flatly refused. They even hung up on Delta when they spoke to the baggage department in ATL and asked if they could run it over to Delta baggage. As a former major airline pilot, I am familiar with the baggage process and I know it wouldn't have taken more than 10 minutes to handle the situation. Fly United only as a last resort!",-1
2023-05-17,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to London via Newark,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,really enjoyed the service,False," We really enjoyed the service on all our flights with United, LHR-SFO-KON-HNL-EWR-LHR. Ground staff and cabin crew were very pleasant and approachable. Especially for the crew, nothing was too much trouble, very helpful and friendly. On the LHR flight, captain was even greeting passengers at the door himself, which was a lovely touch. Definitely one of the best cabin crew service experience, nowadays a lot of airlines do not have such a service, which is a shame. The food was very tasty on all sectors as well. Some flights were delayed but the staff did a great job constantly keeping us informed, including text msg alerts. Great selection of movies on the flights. It was a pleasure to fly with United, and we would use them again any day!",1

Joined thinking I could earn miles when purchasing tickets for family, but just flings out that even though I purchased the tickets for people who are elderly and don't travel, I have to lose the miles because I'm not actually the one flying. Tickets were purchased under my account and they can obviously tell. Then try to get me to apply for a credit card that still won't allow me to earn miles when I purchase for sometime else. So many other airlines with cheaper flights that I could've, and will in the future, opted for than this. I only flew with them for business, but I'll happily be taking the companies and my money somewhere else where I can earn when I spend money.",-1
2023-05-12,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,3.0,4,FAs were polite and efficient,True," Last leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. UA1536, LAX-IAH used a 753 on 05/10, leaving at around 1am local time, just a few minutes behind schedule. Boarding was done by zone and very orderly. Even though it was a full flight, thankfully not that many people were carrying multiple bags that will have to be checked in if there is no room in the overhead bins and might cause delay to the departure. The FAs were polite and efficient but they were not as personable and communicative as the ones we just met in our flights throughout Asia. They made one drink round and offered pretzels with the drinks, and then they were back to collect the trash. Very different experience in this 2.5 hours flight with this so-called full-service airline, compared to another 2.5 hours flight in Asia with another, real, full-service airline which served hot food and alcoholic drinks for free. Overall the flight was uneventful, and we land in IAH around 10 minutes early.",1

2023-05-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Nashville,3.0,,2.0,,,2.0,2,purposeful inconveniencing of passengers,True,"  
My husband and I boarded Group 4 today on flight UA1927. In the middle of boarding Group 3, the gate staff started telling people that the overhead bins were full and that we had to check our bags and pick them up at the gate. I could see the frustration on the faces of many ahead of us as they asked questions and were told that checking their bags was mandatory. And this was, of course, an inconvenience to my husband and me as we had a tight deadline once our flight landed to get our rental car and head to a business meeting. However, we were patient and complied. As we walked down the hallway to drop off our carryons, a fellow passenger came out of the plane and asked the worker for his bag back because he was told by a flight attendant that there was space in the overhead bins for his bag. Puzzled, we continued to drop off our bags and board the plane. Long story short, we boarded the plane to find an abundance of space in the overhead bins, which showed that we were essentially lied to by flight staff. For what reason I have no clue. Maybe to inconvenience passengers in the hope that next time they will upgrade their ticket? It couldn't be because of weight because the bags go to the bottom of the plane when being checked. Whatever the reason, my husband and I were incredibly inconvenienced. Once we landed and walked to baggage claim, we waited 30 minutes for our bags to arrive. Thirty minutes that we did not have and could have been saved if we were not lied to and were allowed to place our carryons in two of the abundance of spaces available on the plane. This kind of treatment and purposeful inconveniencing of passengers is unacceptable.",-1

2023-05-09,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Newark,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3,told that there could be no compensation,True,"  To place this review in perspective, we arrived safely. UA had a mechanical delay with the plane that forced us to arrive 4 hours later than planned. Traveling with children, we arrived at approximately 2 am to our destination (2 hrs from our final house-destination). Due to our late arrival, our rental car company (newark airport) was closed. Told we could not sleep in the airport, we found the cheapest newark hotel we could ($155), arriving about 3am. The next morning, we returned to the car rental to a 2-hour line. By the time we were served, they had only one car left (the lot was empty) with pax behind us; I guess, out of luck. The only rental option was an upgrade (for the week rental) that would eventually cost us about $180 additional to the pre-arranged economy car fare we had booked weeks in advance. I talked them down to $190 or it would have been more. All told, we incurred about $350 in expenses, some of which we requested refunded by UA. Now, five months later, I am still trying to get the compensation (any compensation). Had this been a weather-related or similar issue, I'd accept the loss. But it was mechanical (the Pilot and the support staff at the gate had both announced to the cabin the reasons for the delay). Eventually, they promised $200 citing that as their maximum. Then I was told that there could be no compensation for us since we incurred the expenses at our point of arrival (destination) .. which is bizarre since that would often be (almost always) the site of incurring expenses for a delayed flight,  especially because our destination was not our home. I do not fault the airline and I am happy that they fixed the plane before flying but one should not have to work so hard over five months to get partial compensation.",1

I booked a flight for 2.30pm out of New Orleans to Louisville with a layover in Houston. My original flight was delayed for a total of an hour. Told twice it was only 20 more min. Due to a ""technical"" issue. Then when we finally took off, we landed as the connecting flight was leaving. We landed at 4.30 and was told the next available was 8.10. It is now 9.10 pm as I type this. Delayed 2 more times on the 8.10 flight...due to ""Technical"" issues then told to deplane and the next flight is 10.30 if they can find a plane. I knew I should have booked Southwest, but trying to save a few bucks and got this.

They rebook me to 0700 and put me in a hotel. I basically sleep one hour to be back to make this flight. Now my 0700 flight is cancelled too! I am currently sitting here praying I can make it to Boston. I’m rebooked again to leave at 2:38pm. Customer service is severely poor, they do not care and this is normal to them.

Not only did their website overcharge me for the seats, sending multiple credit card authorizations to my bank, resulting in over $500 being tied up in authorizations for days, they then switched our seats last minute, pulling us from Economy Plus in the front of the plane and shoving us in the back of the plane. The flight itself was delayed over 12 hours, as they had mechanical troubles. Instead of re-routing us, they strung us along for hours with the promise of a fix. It was only 8 hours into the ordeal they admitted they were bringing in another plane to take us home.

Refused to offer me a hotel voucher. Then booked me for the 2:30 pm flight to Salinas, so I had no choice but to spend over 15 hours at Denver Airport.",-1

2023-05-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly through United again,False,"  Customer service is horrible! I flew into Raleigh with American I was able to bring a carry on which was a small suit case and I checked a bag! Coming back home I was put on United. When checking my bag, I was told my carry on can’t go above me it must go on the floor under my seat, which I was okay with. I get to the gate to check in and the guy immediately has an attitude! I literally told him to talk the attitude out of his voice because the way he was talking he was so rude! Immediately “I don’t know how you guys made it this far with these bags, they need to be checked and that’s going to be $65” so I try to explain to him that upstairs let us through and told me where my bag had to go! This guy had no patience. The staff do not communicate when I asked him to speak to the guy who let me in who caught an argument saying that guy wasn’t in charge! My friend had no problem, her bag was a duffel bag as mine was a smaller suitcase, her bag heals shoes and some of everything hanging out of it! He said absolutely nothing about her bag which was funny because they were the same size just different shaped. I will never fly through United again. This airline is a joke.  Communication is the key, customer skills is something you should have working with guest, and not surprising at all they lacked both.",-1
2023-05-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Minneapolis,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,very disappointed in United Airlines,True,  My flight was supposed to be on Saturday the 29th at 10 pm then it kept getting delayed we got on the plane around 9:45 pm and didn’t get off the plane till 2 in the morning they said we had to go to another gate there was another flight for us at 2:40 am. We then waited there for two hours just for that flight to get canceled then they sent us to a hotel which they did pay for but we didn’t get there till 5 in the morning and had to pay for a 60$ Uber back to the airport the next day. I am not from this area so this was very inconvenient also the next day my flight to Minnesota got canceled again due to air traffic. So this then delayed me arriving to Minnesota two days late and resulted me into missing a day of work witch I had to lose money and spend another day wasting money in another state. I am very disappointed in United Airlines.,-1
2023-05-02,0.3,Solo Leisure,First Class,Columbus to Chicago,5.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the overheads were already filled,False,  I intentionally paid extra for first class and intentionally packed a small bag that would fit in the overhead because I knew I had a very tight connection in Chicago thanks to UA changing flight times. When I boarded with the first class group all of the overheads were already filled I presume either with people who boarded before I did or airline personnel. I feel that the personnel should make sure at least one spot is open for luggage for the first class customers. What is the point of paying twice the fare? Staff was not helpful in correcting the problem.,-1

2023-05-01,0.9,Couple Leisure,First Class,Las Vegas to Houston,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3,I would fly United again for sure,True,"  I want to commend United for the way in which they handled a number of problems we had while flying last week. Our return flight was canceled. There were people readily available to assist in where to go and who to talk to. They were staff just walkng around the gate area waiting to lend help. I was given a card to scan to speak to a live person via chat. That person was on the line very quickly. They were not able to get me a direct flight that same day but directed me to the Customer Service gate area where I could see an agent in person. With about 10 people in line, I only waited abouit 10 minutes. They had 6 agents working to help. The agent I spoke to worked very quickly to find me a next day flight. (The flight cancellation was due to weather and affected other flights as well). My husband has cancer, is very weak, has PAD in his legs and can't fly multiple stop flights. Due to the medical problems as well as the fact we were flying first class due to my husband's health, the agent issued me a hotel voucher as well as food vouchers. The next day, we were told that the seat I was assigned to, had a loose and wobbly armrest and the seat could not be used. There was no other available seat in first class so I would have to fly economy. I let them know that I am my husband's caregiver and that is was necessary for me to be with him. The gate attendant assured me they would resolve the matter. They offered a generous travel voucher via the loudspeaker to any volunteer that would give up their seat to someone needing a seat due to medical reasons. Someone gave up their seat and we were able to sit together in first class for the flight. My husband had wheelchair service to the door of the plane and we were boarded first. When we got him into his seat, the rest of the passengers were allowed to board. The service from Vegas to Houston and back was great. The flight attendants were all friendly and helpful. Drink and food service was fast. The food was good ! The free direct TV in flight as well as the complimentary earbuds were great. The flights were on time and smooth. I would fly United again for sure. The response from all involved was fast and friendly.",1

Rude staff, unorganized. They tell you there is enough room for bags and then make you check it as you’re boarding. Phone chargers in the seats don’t work. Moved to another seat and it was also broken. Customer service is pathetic and non existent. United says service is its priority behind safety which tells me I should be afraid on this flight. I will never, ever fly United again. Also, it’s my first, and last, flying United.",-1

I’ve never had an airline great me this terribly. Secondly, I was told I wasn’t checked in, the lady was incorrect in stating this, I had checked in the morning of (online) and of course went to the podium to check in a bag. I went back to the main United Airlines Podium after denial to my flight and the agent mentioned I was indeed checked in for the flight, she didn’t understand why I was rejected entry. All of this caused a missed flight for a business related trip. Flying with United was a mistake, I will continue to fly with Delta moving forward to receive fair treatment, I don’t expect much but I won’t settle for the service I received with United.",-1

They won’t help with anything, just tell you to go to their website. They put me and my family through hell. They are a disgrace to humanity.

We waited on the Customer Service line for 2 hours. During this time, I asked multiple agents at gates for help, and was told that I needed to wait in the understaffed customer service line. I was told by agents who were too busy on their personal cell phones that they couldn’t help me establish a connection. When I asked the second agent to ask a supervisor to send additional staff to customer service, she ignored me. I continued to ask what to do next and she just looked through me and resumed using her phone as if I didn’t exist. Most other airlines will offer assistance at the gate or counter. This would not us ever happened with an airline like Alaska. I hope to never be forced to fly with United again.",-1

Couldn’t get a boarding pass until I paid $35 each and checked the carry on bags! The best any United rep had to say is I should have read the fine print. No waiver. No recourse. Pay or miss your flight. Insult to injury, they asked multiple time for volunteers to check bags free at the gate  Definitely get the top-down-corporate-vibe from employees they could care less about your business.

Ok, it happens. I submitted a claim and United sent me a form to fill out, where I listed every little thing in the bags and painstakingly tracked down the required receipts. It came to just under $1000. After waiting about six weeks, I was informed by their agent that their “policy” does not cover reimbursement for many of the things in my bag, such as prescription glasses and computer hard drives (brand new, with receipts). They declared that they will pay me $314 for my $1000 worth of lost luggage as “full and final settlement”. I wrote back to let them know this was unacceptable, and was ignored. To sum up, I handed them a bag with $1000 worth of stuff, they lost it, and are now nickle-and-diming me for their mistake by hiding behind some asinine policy.",-1

I didn’t even realize that was a scammy thing I had to watch out for when booking. I flew from Louisville to Newark and my connecting “flight” was a bus ride to Allentown. I’m already upset because the lady at the boarding counter was clearly not happy to be there and was reflecting that in everything she did.

The current plane has been here since yesterday and now, at 7 am, they find out that a maintenance of the plane is deemed to be the right thing to do. Never mind that over a 100 people paid to be at work by 9am. But boarding wouldn’t happen before 10:30am. In any other business this would be unacceptably unprofessional. It would also be more than enough reason to compensate the involved parties, but United keeps piling it on. “Safety is their priority and excuse to do whatever they do” Certainly, that was my last lesson to avoid them (United Airlines) at any rate in the future.",-1
2023-04-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst airline I’ve flown with,True,"  Worst airline I’ve flown with. This airline needs to go out of business. I flew out of lax to Denver, once we got to Denver airport we circled it a few times and decided to go to grand junction for fuel instead of landing because of “weather”. The weather was nice and then the flight got canceled so we had to stay at grand junction, they got us a hotel and food vouchers witch was the only positive thing about this horrible trip, we had to get up and be on a shuttle by 6am, we go to the airport to fly, plane gets delayed. We get on the flight, plane is delayed from taking off, we finally start flying after a while and everything goes as normal, we get to Denver and me and my family wait for 9 hours, we get to our next flights gate, after those 9 hours sacrificed the flight gets canceled once again, no surprise this time. Now we are at customer support and writing this review.",-1
2023-04-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1,An absolutely horrid experience,False,"  An absolutely horrid experience. Never again will I fly on this airline. I will make multiple stops elsewhere on another airline, even if United flies direct to our destination. We left Tahiti on United Airlines bound for San Francisco and then on to Baltimore Washington International. Departure from Tahiti was just shy of 90 minutes late while they waited for “late passengers.” Really? This our arrival to San Francisco as significantly late and when we arrived, there was no attendant for the Jetbridge, so we sat at the gate for somewhere between 10-15 minutes. Next was Customs which was awesome and then onto our connecting flight to Baltimore. Except we missed the 45 minute check-in requirement by 12 minutes! Therefore, we “missed” our flight to Baltimore. So then, we worked with a ticketing agent (very nice and helpful) who booked us on the next available flight, 15 hours later! We were originally booked in First Class which was not available on the re-booked flight. No problem, we just needed a ride home. So we were booked into Economy Coach at the same price we paid for First Class (same day bookings are much more expensive!). We were told at booking that we were in Emergency Exit row seats and would have to keep any onboard items stowed above (i.e. NOT under the seat in front of us). After placing a near empty backpack into the overhead bin, I was told it needed to stay under my seat until after take off. A conversation ensued about the discrepancy and I was told it was “that way for this flight.” When I challenged the Flight Attendant, I was informed that I was “a disruptive passenger and she outdated have to talk with the Captain.” Just for challenging safety regulations bout which I was informed prior to boarding? Next, the Ground Agent came to our seat to tell me that he was considering “having me removed from the flight because the Flight Crew feared for their safety.”  Just because I challenged the safety regulations which the ticketing agent stated? Ultimately, I was informed that I was “allowed to remain on the flight”, albeit with great embarrassment. The Flight Attendant responsible for this debacle was absolutely the rudest I have encountered on any flight to multiple destinations around the world. Our “consideration” for all of this was a $150 voucher each, which I ask the airline to donate to the charity of their choice. Finally, a side note. We had flown United to Hawaii a year earlier and encountered the very same “snarkiness” of the Flight Crew. Never, ever, will we fly on United Airlines again. At best, their culture is is really bad, and at worst, they just don’t care.",-1
2023-04-18,0.7,Couple Leisure,First Class,Key West to Houston,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,3,This flight was good,True,"  This flight was good. On time even early and no hick ups and early arrival.

2023-04-17,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Seattle,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,you do not trust your passengers,False,"  Dear UAL Marketing Team, I am writing to express my concerns about the flawed marketing concept that you have recently implemented with respect to carry-on baggage requirements for passengers traveling without carry-on bags. I strongly believe that restricting a boarding pass for those passengers without carry-on bags is not only unnecessary, but also punitive to those who choose to check-in at the kiosk instead of online. As someone who often travels on basic economy class, I already experience the lowest possible service that you offer. However, the added layers of unnecessary steps only make the experience even worse. It is disappointing to see that you are needlessly adding extra steps that make me think twice about choosing UAL whenever possible. The needless step of checking with your staff for examination because of your lack of trust shows that you do not care about your economy class customers. It is unfair to assume that just because a passenger chooses not to bring a carry-on bag, they must be scrutinized more. This sends a message that you do not trust your passengers, which is not the best way to build a strong relationship with them. I suggest that you figure out a better, less punitive way to treat your good basic economy class passengers. This will not only improve the overall customer experience, but it will also demonstrate that you value all of your passengers equally. Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns. I hope that you will take them into consideration and make the necessary changes to improve the customer experience for all passengers.",1

Did not think it was their problem to solve and there was broken linkage between Expedia and United. Aside from Air crew cabin tried to help but everyone else at the airport terminal was extremely rude and not helpful in any way. Refused to acknowledge that there is an operational gap. A brief Google shows that unless seat selection is done on United site, it will not get honored and you will not be notified. Staff refused to acknowledge that Expedia is a booking partner. It's known that United falls behind with service rating, but paid for seat selections that are not honored is pretty bad. Choose another airline with better rating if possible.",-1

She was very rude and unprofessional. She didn’t go above and beyond to explain policies and procedures to customers.  I addressed her about the behavior and she didn’t care to listen to me and told me to do whatever I wanna do. Such people make me lose the love I have for United Airlines,-1

Our flight was double booked and we called to cancel one. We got the confirmation for the flight we canceled but apparently the one we wanted was cancelled as well. We didn’t realize until we were looking for the return flight check in. We checked all emails we got the email confirmation for the cancellation for the one we wanted to to cancel for the double booking but no email about cancelling the second flight that we wanted. We also were able to fly on the incoming flight to our trip but not able to fly back and they try to say it wasn’t their fault but we never cancelled and they wouldn’t honor anything and wasn’t accommodating with anything. If I were able to give them 0 I would. Their solution was to pay 3k for new tickets. Originally was giving us a price 300 per person after going back and forth changed to thousands of dollars.,-1

This is the second time I've encountered severely poor service from United airlines not only did I not make it to my destination today they tried to accommodate me to stay in a state that was not part of my itinerary nor my destination.

Somehow between five years, the only times I utilized United to fly from Missouri to Palm Springs, my flights were delayed both times and the connecting flights were missed.

First we have been dispersed all over the plane as family with 2 minors. We approached the desk and a “nice” lady greeted us with almost a slap in the face rather than a Hello. Things get worse, my son was thirsty and I ask for cup of water they sad we are about to take off no water. Ok I understand. No seatbelt sign went off and I waited 5 min for them to go in the back when I buzzed the bell they saw and ignore for 10min. After I start buzzing 15 time lady came with half glass and handed over like we were animals. She promptly ignored us all the trip skipped giving us drinks by turning her head around. Food was yelled at us instead of explaining. Unfortunately United was the only available option for this trip but for sure this will be my last time flying with this poor company. Oh by the way don’t try contacting their customer service ! It does not exist! Or at least after 1,5h that I was on the wait I decided to just give up! What a disgrace for an airline.",-1
2023-04-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Honolulu via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,wifi service never worked,True," I fly on average 2-3 times per week. Usually on Delta but sometimes other airlines. Sometimes even in budget airlines. My HNL-ORD-BWI round trip was approximately a $1500 flight. On the long leg of this flight (over 9 hours) the outbound plane was likely over 20 years old. The seats were old and run down. The entertainment screen was not even nice enough to call mediocre. The return flight was worse. No screen. This plane was so old that it had no screen. On a long haul flight this has now become a necessity. On each of these flight we were served one meal. If you can call it that. My outbound meal was bread and butter, yogurt, and a fruit cup. Furthermore, on a flight that long drinks should be included. They were charging $10 per airline bottle for liquor and you could only purchase one at a time per airline policy. I paid for wifi to keep in contact. This service never worked. I recently had a 6 hour flight on Emirates that was under $700 round trip. We were served 2 amazing meals and a snack as well as free liquor and constant service from amazing flight attendants. I know Emirates is an amazing airline but the contrast is necessary to show how awful this experience was. I will never fly United again. They weren’t even the cheapest for this route. They were the most convenient as far as available times. Next time I will save the money and fly a better airline at the same time.",-1

Almost everything (main noodles, side grain salad, bread, cookie) was starch with only a few sad limp vegetables and literally 5 tiny pieces of lettuce. Bread was old and dry. Sauce was salty/sweet with no other flavor. It was inedible. Later turkey and cheese sandwich with squashed flat bread and no condiments. I would switch airlines to avoid that again.",-1
2023-04-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,airline is absolutely horrible,True,  This airline is absolutely horrible! I flew to Kalispell MT on April 7th barely made two of my connecting flights because they were booked so close together. On the day of my return flight which is today it really just got worse April 9th Easter. We arrive at the airport and stood there for 20 min waiting for someone to print out boarding passes and check our luggage in. The lady was just standing in front of us pretending to do something on her computer before finally another employee said something. Got on the flight first flight was fine then we arrived in Denver. We had about 45 min until our next flight to Chicago and when it was time to board we get on the plane and we sit and sit and finally the pilot comes on the intercom and says they were having a fuel issue. The people who were supposed to come fill up the plane were taking longer than expected it was 40 min at this point. But he assured we would make the time up and be ok after 45 min he says we are getting ready to take off and will be 20 min behind. My next flight was at 1:55 we wouldn’t be arriving at the gate until 1:40. So I’m already freaking out because our connecting gate was far! We had to go from C26 to C1. So I got my bf to contact the terminal and let them know to wait on us we wouldn’t be to late. They agreed. And said we will wait. We finally hear the pilot say flight attendants prepare for landing. Next thing you know we start going back up in the air again! We’re all like what is going on? The pilot comes on the intercom and says unfortunately we can’t land yet because there’s another plane on the runway so we have to make a couple circles. I knew at this point we were doomed. They took there time making there way to the gate when we landed and had us sit on the plan for another 15-20 min before then let us off. We ran so far and fast I almost passed out and I had my 11 year old kid with me. We get there and they are gone! No one’s there to help rebook my flight I go to the one beside c1 and they keep pointing me to a barcode that wouldn’t work. I go up to another desk and they say go to c7 I go to c7 they point me to b19 finally get to the desk they didn’t have any available flights until tomorrow so we had to get a hotel and stay in Chicago. Don’t have Any of our luggage and have no clue where it is. This airline is awful and do not care about their passengers.,-1
2023-04-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vail to Austin via Denver,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,Very poor airline,True,"  Upon landing in Denver we needed to make a connecting flight. The airline had us sitting on the taxi runway for over 30 min while they tried to clear one of their other planes from the terminal. Numerous ppl were going to miss their connecting flights and they knew that. Rather than either hold those planes for a short while so customers could make their flights or immediately rebook them at the landing terminal, they just told ppl to hurry. So I and others ran like crazy just to find out we missed our flights anyways. We get, a much later flight and 15 dollar lunch voucher. No apologies. No explanation. No acknowledgment of the need to improve. No real compensation for the trouble. Very poor airline. Won’t fly them for awhile.",-1

My recent boarding was from Las Vegas to EWR. Disappointed to see no screen on this flight of 5 hours. The same was from LA to Hawaii before. No food, no service, no entertainment.

Also slow and not good at communicating for instance they didn't tell me till I boarded that for some odd reason they would have my seat blocked off so I have to sit away from my 3 year old! And let's not forget the people in front of me, 2 different people where given the same seat!",-1

2023-04-06,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Denver via Minneapolis,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,No appreciation,True," No appreciation for long time customer. Exit row empty yet wanted me to pay $78 to move despite allowing a minimum 400 pound person to buy a single middle seat. All they could say is that they are not allowed to make people comfortable unless we charge them, we have no authority. Pretty sad that employees can not access a situation and use an easy solution to make people happy. I fly over 100 flights a year. None will be with United again.",-1
2023-04-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Panama City to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolute and complete failure as a business,False,"  On April,1 2023, I had a return trip from Panama that landed in DC. From the point of entering these the United States, my experience with United Airlines was terrible. For some reason, customer service is not a value of this company, and I can actually say that it seems like this company values discourteous behavior. Once I arrived at the Dulles airport, I went to several United counters and each worker was rude and condescending. There were many workers at each station, but they were not helpful and I ended up going back and forth from various counters without getting any resolution to my problem. After about an hour, I was able to get a boarding pass. When it was time to board the plane, the lack of good customer service continued. The flight took off late. I was told this cannot be done and that cannot be done. I missed a connecting flight in Chicago. Finally, when I arrived in Milwaukee, my luggage was lost. The lady at the counter said that since it was 12:00 midnight her shift had ended and she walked away. I called the 1-800 number to report that my luggage was missing. Finally, on Monday, I received a call that my luggage was found. The guy on the phone wanted me to come to the airport to pick up my luggage. I have to say that this man was rude, too. Finally, United Airlines is an absolute and complete failure as a business, and the workers are useless.",-1
2023-04-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Lehigh Valley to Colorado Springs,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,complete failure as a business,False,"  Absolute and complete failure as a business. Flight took off late, missed connection flight in Chicago, then UA after 2 hrs of a ca'nt do that and can't do this, they didn't get me to my destination. Then the refund process was even worse than the trip and then the just denied the refund. Apparently it wasn't their fault that they didn't get me to my destination. One of the worst experiences ever.",-1
2023-04-04,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Barcelona via Newark,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3,efficient but not overly friendly,False,"  Two flights in the last ten days. LA to Newark - checking in was very difficult and not helped by the extremely rude staff at the check in kiosks. This was however countered by the very bag drop staff member who was helpful and friendly. This was also the case in Newark when we reboarded for Barcelona. Check in was far more pleasant but boarding was delayed for over an hour while cleaners finished up. Also, at boarding some of the rudest service I have encountered. Told we couldn’t take carry on and then told ‘an announcement was made’ like it was our fault that we had carry on!  On both flights the staff were efficient but not overly friendly, except when you left the plane! The food is mediocre at best but then most airline’s economy fare is much the same - except for the middle eastern and Asian international carriers - they are often exceptional. Maybe United could do some exchange programs so their staff can see how it should be done! On the plus side, the aircraft are new and modern they are a bit cramped, which surprised me as the US is famously full of porky folks! The real plus is the entertainment - if you are a movie fan there is a fairly large choice of new and recent releases and classics in every genre! I was not bored. I would have a far better review if it wasn’t for such poor interactions we had a couple of staff. It’s amazing how a fairly decent experience can be so totally spoiled by a couple of rotten apples in the team. I remember a fairly important lesson I learned in my younger hospitality days based on research. It was shown that those that have a nice or great experience will share that experience with a few people, when a bad experience is had it will be shared with many many more. This was my bad experience and it is now being shared with many.",-1
2023-04-04,0.3,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Haneda to Newark,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,a truly second-rate airline,True,"  United is a truly second-rate airline, and it is fast on its way to become third-rate. This business class cabin was particularly poorly served. Slovenly boarding was followed by nobody to great and guide to the seat. The cabin was full of burnt smoke. Passengers were still boarding when a flight attendant obstructed the isles with taking meal orders. I was immediately informed that my first choice meal may not be available in the 5th row. Certainly, no welcome drink or a hot towel were served before this 13-hour flight. Flight attendants appeared disorderly, indifferent and disorganized. Polaris business class passengers were the 4th group to board, following disabled, children (teenagers), uniformed military and other 1K passengers. What kind of premium services are we paying for? Stay away from this airline and do not even think of paying a penny for their anything “premium”.",-1

Missed connection by 12 hours after scheduled arrival time. United still has not gotten bag back to me 2 days later. I used all online forms, texts and attempted to call: “bag is out for delivery” is the response to a Track. Used to be a loyal United customer. Will never fly United again.

2023-03-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Vancouver,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,Food quality was terrible,False," Worst onboard customer service. Not only were they rude, they only cared to talk amongst themselves and not care for their passengers. I had a toddler napping and all they did was chit chat and laugh loudly, and wake up my toddler on a trans pacific flight. Great job guys! Food choices and quality was terrible. I understand we booked economy, but the food was beyond bad. Choices were Chicken or Pasta. Then they ran out of chicken when they got to my row, so we had pasta. The pasta was bland and soggy. The ""snacks"" they had were turkey and cheese sandwiches which were dry and cold. Worst is they do not compensate anything for their fault. My flight was cancelled due to some mechanical error so they rebooked me for an outbound flight 2 days later. I had to stay an extra 2 days, and pay all my meals without any compensation when it's not my fault. Never will I fly with them again and I will advise anyone I know to not fly with them.",-1
2023-03-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to San Diego,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,Regret flying with this company,True,"  Regret flying with this company and won’t make that mistake again!! Rude from start to end, they try to find a way to charge you for a small purse I was able to fit inside my carryon bag but it’s ridiculous how they want you to pay for everything when you are entitled to carry a bag in plane! They are not clear with instructions when I’m telling them I couldn’t get ticket online because it said I wasn’t checking in any bags so I had to go to check in desk and get boarding ticket. There I tried telling them I wasn’t paying for baggage and they kept insisting that my bag had to be paid, I know it’s a small bag permitted and fit in your box “allowed carry on without charge “ but they kept wanting to charge me. Finally got the clear and was able to board plane but not a good experience having your employees treat you disrespectfully and taking advantage of customers by lying and trying to get away with overcharging.",-1

Due to an hour of avoidable delays on the tarmac after landing, and then sprinting through the terminal to arrive 2 minutes prior to scheduled take-off we were told rudely that the plane had already left and “there was nothing to do about it now” with an eye roll from the attendant. We were then told we could have a next-day flight to Norfolk leaving at 10:30, 3 hours AFTER my son’s graduation from A-school would happen. They didn’t care. They didn’t apologize. We were told by multiple passenger bystanders that Newark is always this bad with connections. United held us on the plane while other “more pressing connections” were prioritized over us. United didn’t offer a refund, a voucher, or anything else at ALL! We DROVE to Norfolk overnight in a rental. I ended up paying full price for driving 6.5 hours! United is horrible.

I intentionally paid a premium price for an adequate layover time to transfer my handicapped elderly parent through the Denver airport. United months before the flight changed the timing to only allow only 40 minutes for a layover which is not enough time for my immobile parent. Mind you this was a booking for 9 people over $10,000. (Two seats were first class, one was for my mother) I spend 2 hours on the phone with them and there is nothing they can do for me and my group. So frustrated!",-1

Customer service is a joke. I missed a flight on the way out, now I can't pre-check because they need to verify documents. No where to send these documents, I asked that yesterday. Seriously dissatisfied. The only thing I want to do is reserve a seat next to my son. Nope we don't have that option. Thumbs down.",-1
2023-03-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Puerto Villarta,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1,bottom for almost everything,False," My wife and I flew out early on 1 March from SLC to Puerto Vallarta. This trip was to celebrate my birthday, on the 4th, and our 30th wedding anniversary, on the 6th. We were scheduled on a flight that left at 6:45AM and arrived pretty close to the time we needed to check our bags. Since there is a hard cut-off 45 minutes before the flight, we tried to go straight to the counter but a United employee insisted that we go to the kiosk first. She had trouble at the first kiosk and after a few minutes, went to a second kiosk, where she didn't seem to know what she was doing. We finally just ignored her and walked up to the counter. The gate agent helped us but because of the 5-10 delay minute caused by the first employee, we were TWO minutes past the hard cut-off to get our bags on the plane. That meant that we couldn't get on our original flight. She was able to book us on different flights but we ended up getting to Puerto Vallarta hours later than originally planned. We were scheduled to go to a highly recommended dinner/show cruise that evening but because of our late arrival we missed the show ($140.00 per person). Despite that initial mishap, the rest of our trip was great and we were looking forward to returning to Salt Lake on Saturday evening, the 4th, and then on Sunday, enjoying a 30th anniversary brunch planned by our four children and about twenty of our friends, neighbors & extended family. Unfortunately, our Saturday afternoon flight from Puerto Vallarta was delayed (no reason given) for several hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight in Denver. We arrived so late that there were no more flights on Saturday night but got booked us on a flight the next morning. The earliest we could leave was sometime around noon and we didn't arrive in Salt Lake until about 2:00, meaning we missed the 30th anniversary brunch our family had scheduled for us. We always try to be positive and make the best of bad situations. The incompetence of United Airlines caused us some major stress and grief, but we are focusing on the positive aspects of our trip and had a delayed celebration of our anniversary last weekend at our home with our kids and a few others. I prefer to put this whole incident behind us and chalk it up to experience, but for us and most of our family and friends, United is now on the same do not fly list with the other bottom feeders like Frontier. I reached out to United and got one of those 'thank you for your input, we won't do anything' form letters. What a joke this airline has become. No wonder they're rated at the bottom for almost everything.",-1

2023-03-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Washington DC,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no longer respect their customers,False," We made reservations a month ahead of our family trip to DC. One day before the trip we tried to check in on line and learned that the flights were cancelled due to overbooking without any notification to us. We already paid for no-refundable fee for a week for a hotel in DC, which we lost, not to mention the fact that our family trip was completely ruined. The worst part was when I contacted the United Air customer service they simply refused to make any compensation for their wrongdoings. This is the true danger of M&A among airlines and the few surviving airlines no longer respect their customers. Nonetheless we would NEVER use this terrible airline.",-1

Prepare to be inconvenienced and lots of angry passengers. They will charge for bags, charge if you have to check at the gate even if their overheads are full, charge for seats and explain nothing. They are now at the bottom of the list of airlines I would fly. United used to be equal to a Delta, American or Alaska, they are now several levels lowers.",-1

Complete incompetence from start to finish. 1 hour flight from Manchester to Newark took 2.5 hours with 40 minutes sitting on tarmac with rude flight attendants barking that no one could get up to use the restroom or we would not proceed to the gate. Missed connection, waited an hour to reschedule flight, waited 4 hrs for flight then boarding was delayed again for an hour to wait for a team of clowns with a trash bag and a dirt devil to clean the plane for all of 5 minutes.

The United site for check in is slow and disconnects, so re-entering flight information must be done several times. You struggle to get the seat map to display. This also takes several tries. I finally get a seat and try to get a seat for the Swiss flight to Zurich. That option is not available. Check in at the airport goes smoothly until the machine prints the boarding passes and I am assigned a Swiss seat but I did not get to pick it. I have no idea if I am window aisle or in the middle. Going to the United gate person is no help. He can only change the United flight seat and can do nothing with the Swiss seat. And these two airlines are supposed to partners?

I wish she was available when I arrived to SAT, maybe things would’ve turned out differently. She is exactly what all United ticket counter employees sure try and emulate. Attentive and in front of their computers instead of talking to employees away from the counter and avoiding eye contact with customers checking in. I would like to start this post by stating “I missed my flight”, no one else’s fault but mine. When I arrived 30 minutes prior to my flight the first ticket counter staff there was not helpful or empathetic to the start of my debacle. Stating I will not be able to fly out until tomorrow morning with many flights available which was not a possibility and needed to be at a work function in D.C area. After 2hrs and 30 minutes on the phone with my travel coordinator, I was able to get an earlier arrival flight with American Airlines and my United ticket was fully refundable.

2023-03-19,0.4,Business,Economy Class,Ft Myers to San Francisco,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3,Embarrassed for United,True,"  Embarrassed for United. I booked a direct Ft Myers to San Francisco flight on one of the newer routes is developing. I paid extra for this flight. However, due to mechanical issues after a five hour delay the flight was cancelled. Ultimately I arrived in San Francisco after a 12 hour inconvenience. Then on the flight home I opted to stay a day later to make up the lost day. As a result I had to be routed SFO-DEN-RSW. The SFO-DEN flight was delayed at the gate twenty minutes, but the flight crew was able to make up the time and we arrived the airport on time. Unfortunately, both of the 777 capable gates were occupied and so we got to wait on the taxiway for long enough time for me to miss my connection home. The next flight is tomorrow on standby at 935 or confirmed at 5:45pm. On the bright side I got a free room and night in Denver. I also was given a $150 travel credit. I wonder if it would just be cheaper to have flight operations and mechanics better paid and better managed? Also, the seats are miserable in coach. No elbow room and the seat pitch is murderous. Flight attendant staff were pleasant and professional on the triple seven. United can do better than this.",-1
2023-03-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to San Francisco,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,This whole trip was a nightmare,True,"  This whole trip was a nightmare from start to finish. When I got to BWI for UA730 leaving 6:10am for SFO on March 5th, the usually deserted United desk was a teeming mass of panicked passengers. When I looked for the self-serve boarding pass kiosks (I only had carry-on), I was dismayed to find that they were all gone. After the experience of a colleague with making a confirmation and then missing the flight due to car trouble, I make a point of only confirming at the terminal. Nonetheless, I tried the link on the text from United and it directed me to download the United app. I then had to wrack my brain to remember my United password, but was able to provide it. Once it downloaded and I confirmed, after some effort I was able to find the tiny ""boarding pass"" link. My phone was only 10% charged and I then had a race against time to reach the gate before I lost my digital boarding pass. I did make the flight, but barely. Too bad United didn't tell us in advance that they were making these changes. On my return flight the crew just stood there smiling while all the overhead bins filled up and the passengers, including me, were standing around helpless. They finally informed us that we would be allowed to put our rolling luggage in the first class bins. At my DIA connection the crew were again all smiles. Only after I was in the terminal did I realize that my hour layover was suddenly much shorter. The crew had failed to mention that the plane was thirty minutes late and maybe people with connecting flights should run? I further didn't realize at first because it seems that United has eliminated the arrival boards at DIA . I staggered to the gate as quickly as I could, only to arrive one minute too late (by the clock) and the gate attendant stonily informed me I could not board. My dismay was dispelled when a uniformed stewardess stopped next to me and she told him that she also needed to be on the plane (I think she said she had been on the same flight from SFO) and that she was ""dead-headed"", which apparently meant that although she wasn't scheduled to be crew on the missed flight, she would end up missing another flight where she was needed. The gate attendant told both of us he would see what he could do and called up his superior. He then told the stewardess that she could board but that I was still out of luck. I then asked for help rebooking. He informed us there was another flight to Baltimore but that it was too late to make the gate, so we would best go to the customer service desk in the other terminal. About maybe one hundred yards along (seven gates) I was shocked to see ""Baltimore"" on the gate! I rushed to it, but the gate was literally closed in my face and was again told I was too late. Apparently this was the flight the other gate attendant was referring to was this one! We could easily have made it if we had known! The flight was marked as being 10-15 minutes late so perhaps he was not aware of this? Nonetheless, it would have been easy to just call ahead and check or to tell us to run and hope. I ended up having to take a flight back to California to LAX and from there a red-eye to finally arrive at BWI. At least this part of the journey went without a hitch. I will never fly United again.",-1

After I took my seat, my smart watch verified me that my cell phone was not on the plane with me. The crew and attendants were already boarded and the cabin was shut. I was 6 months pregnant at the time of traveling with a husband and 2 children under the ages of 5 who were back at home that I wished to keep in contact with during my travels. I spoke with a flight attendant regarding my missing merchandise and she went above and beyond to ensure I had my cell phone before the plane departed.

We arrived in Aspen airport at about 12 noon. Our flight United Express UA4720 was scheduled to depart at 1:52pm. Our boarding passes stated we would commence boarding at 1:27pm. The following Texts received from United: Flight UA4720 is delayed because an earlier impacted your plane’s arrival. It now departs at 2:06pm. Flight UA4720 is further delayed because we are waiting for a gate to become available. It now departs at 3:00. -Flight UA4720 from Aspen is further delayed because we are waiting for gate to become available. It now departs at 3:35. You can rebook your flight to a different day. Flight UA472O from Aspen to Denver is delayed further because it is taking longer than expected to load baggage. It now departs at 4:05. You can rebook your flight to a different day. Flight 4720 did not pull away from the gate until 4:30pm. Due to incoming flights, and being in queue behind a caravan of about a half dozen private jets, we were not cleared for takeoff until shortly after 5:00pm. Due to incoming flights, and being in queue behind a caravan of about a half dozen private jets, we were not cleared for takeoff until shortly after 5:00pm. We missed our outgoing flight and the last flight for the night to Washington DC by approximately 20 minutes. After waiting in line at customer service for almost an hour, the final indignity from United Airlines was the complete lack in compassion from customer service. It was now after 7:00pm. Not allowing my frustration to get in the way, “can you offer us hotel compensation as our departure from Aspen was not a weather related delay”, I calmly asked the agent. “No, I’m very sorry, we can’t offer you a voucher because our computer indicates your flight was held back by the control tower at Aspen Airport”, she responded. I showed her the series of texts we received indicating the contrary and she would not budge. “We have to go by what is indicated in our system; you should address your complaint to Aspen airport” “We have to go by what is indicated in our system; you should address your complaint to Aspen airport”. “As a courtesy, can you at least provide us meal vouchers for dinner?” “No, I’m really sorry, it’s against United Airlines policy”, she countered. With an imperative demeanor, she handed us two water bottles each containing toiletry kits. We have been traveling to Aspen for holiday more than 20 years to enjoy skiing on world class ski slopes, as well as indulging in the many other diversions Aspen offers. In conclusion, we can no longer depend on using United Express as a reliable airline for our future travel needs and will choose a method of conveyance which is more amenable to reach our destination.",-1
2023-03-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1,inconvenient uncomfortable experience,False,"  Discount airline in disguise. Discount airlines boast low fares with the clear understanding that everything including seats selection will be an add on. United operates as a discount airline without the low fares. No electronic boarding pass as you can with any other airline including discount. Economy legroom is less than jet blue! Paid for wifi Not working. Paid for airport lounge So crowded and hot that we left the lounge, people sleeping everywhere and we couldn’t find a seat … to go back into the terminal where the sit down French brasserie had better food (only subs in the lounge) at the same cost per person as the lounge. We checked in one terminal but our gate was 3 terminals buildings away. $700 per person for inconvenient uncomfortable experience for a 2.5 hour flight. When I buy discount airline tickets, I’m not upset because of the trade off with the fare.",-1
2023-03-12,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Haneda to Chicago,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,courteous and attentive throughout,True,"  Flying in United's Polaris is generally a pleasant experience. On this particular trip, the chief steward was really excellent and most of his staff were good, as well. The meals are still pretty basic for business class. Basically a two plate meal and dessert. Quite a downgrade from pre-Covid times. No longer do they offer any type of Japanese cuisine for the main meal which doesn't make good sense to me. That said, the flight, while not extraordinary, was just fine. Entertainment options were plentiful. Everything went smoothly. My only disappointment would be in the meals, neither which can compare to those offered by Japanese airlines on the same route. I also found the staff to be courteous and attentive throughout. Announcements, though infrequent, were helpful and friendly.",1
2023-03-12,0.3,Business,Business Class,New York to Amsterdam,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Will never fly them again,True,"  Terrible. I used to fly United a lot. But having been using Delta. Thought I’d try them out of Newark in Polaris because they were a lot less expensive than Delta/KLM. You get what you pay for. Old tired cabin lousy selection of movies, meal was yuk. They didn’t even ask if I wanted a glass of wine with my meal. USB did not work. Awful experience. Will never fly them again. No wonder they get three stars",-1
2023-03-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Houston,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Never again United Airlines,True, I purchased 2 tickets 60 days in advance for a flight. I was flying with an elderly person that has hearing difficulties. I needed to be on the same flight. When we checked in for the flight 24 hours in advance. We were both given a seat assignment. About 14 hours before the flight I received a text that I needed to recheck in. When I rechecked in I found that they had moved me to a different flight that was 3 hours earlier. After 4 hours on the phone/computer trying to get back on original flight. I was informed that the flight was oversold. I later found out from the other traveler that there was several lady golfers going to a tournament. They were last minute ticket purchases due to a date mix up. It’s a guess but I bet United sold my economy ticket for a premium. I ask if the fee’s I paid for a checked bag had been transferred to my new check in conformation code. I was assured it had been. Now I need to find a 3 am ride to the airport. After arriving in Houston airport I had to find the elderly traveler. Got on the next leg of flight and made it to final destination. Went to check in for return flight. Found out United didn’t transfer fees I paid for luggage. I had receipts where I had paid. Was told if I wanted bags on plane that I would have to pay fees again. So I did. Once I got home I spent another hour on phone getting a refund for baggage fees. It’s funny how when they charged me it was instant. But my refund will take 14 days. Never again United Airlines.,-1
2023-03-10,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Merida to Calgary via Houston / Denver,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,Thank you for getting me home safely,True,"  I had a major surgery in Mexico due to an accident, and had to fly home while unable to ambulate effectively. My husband requested wheelchair service for all flights for our trip home on Feb. 28th. From Merida Mexico, through to Calgary, the service was definitely better than I had hoped for. Only at 1 gate did I have to wait for a wheelchair (even though they had one ready for me, someone else must have taken it by the time I was the last one off the plane). The stewardesses were very apologetic, and they all waited with me until a wheelchair arrived (which took about 15 minutes). They recognized that my use of crutches down the aisle was an extreme difficulty, and there wasn't any way I could deboard the plane into the airport without the wheelchair. My porters in each airport were friendly and courteous. The airline staff were very patient with my slow mobility, and offered assistance etc. Planes were on time except our departing one out of Denver was delayed by 1.5 hrs, which worked out ok as we had originally only had 45 minutes in between, which would have been very tight with me being the last one off the plane, and waiting another 15 minutes for the wheelchair. We go to Mexico every year, and have flown with United several times, and we will continue to fly United as we feel the service overall is very good. Our delays have always been minor, and we understand many things are simply out of a companies' control when it comes to weather etc. Thank you for getting me home safely after my surgery!",1
2023-03-09,0.2,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to newark,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,3.0,1,United somehow manages to be worse than most,False,"  Even by the very low standards of US Airlines, United somehow manages to be worse than most. At this particular time, my SFO-EWR flight was delayed first by 2 hours due to technical issues, which they apparently didn't even solve, as the plane had to return to SFO after half an hour. Their meal voucher didn't work at two airport vendors (then I gave up trying). Ultimately, the flight had been delayed by 5+ hours before they realized that they had to change the cabin crew who had a very long day already. I would've cancelled the flight but the website (as always) didn't cooperate. The United customer service representative - who was very helpful, but of course couldn't compensate for the overall bad experience - ended up sending me a flight voucher. Sadly it's only available for United flights, rendering it basically worthless.",-1
2023-03-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Fort Lauderdale via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,there's no progress whatsoever,False,"  In August we flew with United Airlines from Brussels to Fort Lauderdale. Our suitcase got lost on the way there. After many emails and phone calls and having provided all the necessary documents, United confirmed on November 27 that they would compensate us with $1500. They also promised to give us a flight voucher valued at $150 per person. We have yet to receive any compensation. Every week, I contact United by phone or email, and I'm told to be patient, because it can take up to 30 business days to transfer the money. Clearly, it has been far more than 30 business days since the initial confirmation on November 27 from United, regarding the compensation. Every week I call about our case, and yet there's no progress whatsoever. I expect better customer service from an American company. I don't know what to do anymore.",-1

We splurged and got 1st class. Worst decision ever - well the 1st was picking United. Anyway attendant never offered 1 drink - hey we were on vaca and I wanted a mimosa - 35 yes is a big deal! She disappeared after our breakfast which was not as we ordered - so who could ask? My husbands seat didn’t recline - broken, my tray table was stuck in up position - basic economy I got for a 1st class ticket price - no TV screen, nothing really zero amenities - I fly 1st class with Delta and American - and they sure give you what you paid for - might as well have been in Frontier, oh I forgot seat pocket in front filled with crayons and someone else’s boarding pass - yeah they cleaned alright!",-1
2023-03-03,0.7,Business,Economy Class,Newark to St. Maarten,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,crew was fast and efficient,True,"  United took me from New Jersey to St. Maarten safely in the middle of about two hours worth of severe turbulence. Our entire flight lasted a bit over 4 hours total. The plane arrived from its previous destination, Cleveland, 35 minutes ahead of schedule, but left 40 minutes after our scheduled departure time due to severe weather. The plane was 23 years old, but very well-kept. While we were over the continental US the Internet worked great and United now allows you to text for free on multiple platforms. The only thing is that when we lost Internet, I was not able to make a food purchase midair because now you have to register your credit card on the app in order to buy onboard and I failed to do that before take off even tho I was prompted to do so multiple times before my flight. The crew was fast and efficient, once the Captain allowed service in the cabin after the 2 hours of turbulence. The seat was much better than pre reclined ultra low cost carriers, if it wasn’t for the two hours that we buckled like a wild horse, it would’ve been pretty good overall. At the end of the day I’m grateful to United for making the best out of a pretty bad weather situation in the end I arrived safely at my destination and that’s all that really matters.",1
2023-03-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to London,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They care about bottom dollars,False,"  The entire duration of the 13 hour flight, I had a defunct television screen that was broken and stuck in the full brightness setting. Everyone else got rest. I got a blaring blue LED light in my face for straight 13 hours. Slept through 85% of my brothers wedding, which was the entire reason for the trip. I’m told by staff to call and explain my horrid situation. It took almost an entire month for United to offer me a $100 in vouchers (1 for $75 and one for $25). That’s not even 1/8th of an upgrade for the flight I was on. United does NOT care about travelers. They care about bottom dollars.",-1
2023-03-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Saskatoon to El Salvador via Toronto / Washington,,,,,,1.0,1,they really screwed me over,True,"  Worst experience flying ever. I booked my flight several months ago, traveling with my little one under a year I made sure to book my trip with the least connections. I had troubles adding her on the reservation so I called the airline to get this done. They took quite a bit to help me but was told it was done, there was no added charge and I was going to receive a confirmation in a couple of days. I received an email with a link to the reservation details, when following the link I could see the 3 of us were booked and everything looked good. When check in time came I went to the website and it said I needed to check in at the airport because they first flight was thru air Canada. I showed up to the airport 2 hours ahead even though you only need about an hour for domestic flights. When I get there Air Canada can not find a ticket for my daughter they took a while trying to solve it but in the end they told me to contact United that it should be an easy fix as she was sitting on my lap. When I contacted United the agent treated us as if we were lying and we didn’t register our daughter, he said there was nothing we could do and it needed to be done by air Canada, mind we told him we were at the airport with all our our bags and our little one and have about and hour and a half before the flight leaves. He said I needed to purchase an infant ticket for her and I said that I wasn’t informed when I called to add her but we could pay her ticket if necessary. United kept telling me I should do that with the airport staff and air Canada kept telling me they can’t do that… this took a while. When I saw the time was getting close and we were not getting anywhere, I asked if I could just buy an adult ticket for my daughter for this flight and just continue with the rest of the trip as paid, he said they didn’t have my daughter at all, when I said I had proof that I had called to add her to the flight and her name in the reservation details he went again to talk to his manager (3rd time).. it seemed so unreasonable that they couldn’t do anything when she was traveling on my lap. He came back and said they see her name but because it’s international and we didn’t pay for a ticket they couldn’t help me. By this time we already missed our flight, we asked to be transferred to the manager after about another hour talking she said they could get us on another flight arriving to our destination 3 days later and with an overnight layover and magically, now she was able to get payment for a ticket for her? Both agents kept an unapologetic attitude even though we were not at fault. You would think that if you call the airline to let them know you are traveling with a kid and they take her name and info, they would tell you you need to pay a ticket. I reminded the manager how hard traveling with kids is, and that an overnight layover was not ideal, also that I had book those dates for a specific event that I was now going to miss. I told her that it was a major inconvenience on top of getting stuck at the airport with a little one and all our luggage for hours without them getting anywhere to now have to come back the following day. She basically said that all she could do to help me. I was so frustrated, tired, sleep deprived that honestly could not take anymore from United I asked for a refund and purchased a way more expensive ticket thru another airline - they really screwed me over and not once took ownership for their mistake.",-1

LAX to Denver Feb 23 on the way home.  Each flight on the way there was on time, respectful and friendly. All our luggage's made it on time (We were a group of 9 passengers) On our way home we were delayed in LAX to Denver, the workers there were very nice and respectful to everyone. Our connection in Denver to Edmonton was only 40 minutes. We let them know and they ensured when we landed to ask everyone to remain seated that didn't need to run and allow us off first. We ran to our connecting flight to find out they held the plane back for us. I want to say thank you for the very smooth, reliable, friendly and outstanding services we received.",1

While I hate to admit it I lost my phone on the plane. They continued to search while boarding two planes and managing all of the chaos.

Firstly, the flight was on time. The flight crew were very professional, laid back, and willing to help. I had the best time chatting with the crew in between food and drink services. The flight itself was very smooth (I know they don't control that) and my seat was comfortable. I would fly United Airlines internationally again.",1
2023-02-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Mexico City to Cleveland via Houston,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,get such poor service,False,"  United is off my list for next trip. I like to be comfortable and being served well as I pay for. Food and even snacks are unacceptable, seriously horrendous. Bad menu choices. Staff do not serve first nor Business correctly. They never ask for my jacket to be hanged on a hanger. They serve in plastic cups in 1st class?. Every time, in every United flight (just got back yesterday from Mexico City through Houston to Cleveland, OH) the staff converse with each other very loud. After Covid (who said it is over?) there is no need to wear a mask, yet so many people were coughing and sneezing constantly, as if someone was very sick. Isn't a duty of the stewards to say something such as: ""Could you please cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough?"". Very mediocre service. It is a shame how disquieting is to pay first class to get such poor service.",-1
2023-02-25,0.3,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Fort Lauderdale to Denver,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1,Economy Plus is a waste,False,"  United airlines Economy Plus is a waste. I upgraded from Economy to Economy Plus for $109. My ticket was purchased 4 months before the flight. I purchased this upgraded seat because of a back problem that I have. I picked an aisle seat so that I could sit sideways and allieve the back pain that I was expecting. Two days before my flight, my seat and row was changed, giving me a center seat. I complained to 6 different people and they all said this happens all the time. For $109 upgrade this should never happen. I will not be flying United again.",-1
2023-02-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Springfield to Sarasota via Houston,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly United again,True,"  My flight was scheduled to leave Springfield at 6:15 am with a connecting flight out of Houston to Sarasota, FL after a 1 hour 14 minute layover. At 6:30am the counter announced they had overbooked and needed 4 people to volunteer for a later flight and $1000 coupon. At 7am it was announced that no one could board until 4 people volunteered to give up their seats--most of us had connecting flights out of Houston, so connections would be missed.Next it was announced all carryons with wheels needed to be checked in on the loading bridge. I asked the agent if it was mandatory to checkin carryons if it was a connecting flight--she replied yes. I said I hoped I didn't miss my connecting flight (also United). We were finally allowed to board, yet sat on the tarmac to be de-iced for a considerable amount of time. We finally landed in Houston at 9:32--My connecting United flight was to depart at 9:44am. I waited to pick up my carry-on, flew through the terminal and arrived at the United counter minutes after the scheduled departure, only to be informed that the door had been closed. No more flights out to Sarasota until the next morning, but one to Tampa at 2:30 pm. My friends had to drive 2.5 hours to get to the Tampa airport (the traffic was crazy that evening) and I had to wait at the airport almost 4 hours. It is unbelievable to me that the flight didn't wait for the people who missed the flight by minutes at United's failures. I will never fly United again.",-1

My flight was cancelled and the earliest they could get me out was 42 hours later. I was able to catch a flight with Southwest the next morning. That United agent said they would reimburse me for the Southwest flight. When I reached out to United to get the reimbursement they indicated they would only refund the portion of my ticket that was cancelled. They were very apologetic and sorry for the inconvenience cancelling my flight, me having to sleep in the Denver airport, but too bad for me. As many miles as I have flown over the years, this was the worst experience I have ever had. Being told one thing and then not honoring their agreement.",-1

This is one of the first times I have chosen to fly with United airlines. Worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Our flight was delayed in Honolulu to san Francisco so we missed our connecting flight. Then they booked us 24 hrs later. That was a problem we both had to work on Monday. So they had another flight that was earlier but to new jersey still put us late on Sunday to arrive in Cleveland. We ended up staying at the airport so we didn't miss our next flight.,-1

2023-02-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Knoxville via Houston,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1,do not plan to fly United again,True,"  My daughter and I flew to San Antonio from Knoxville for my grandson's graduation from Navy A school at Joint Base Fort Sam Houston. The day we were scheduled to leave San Antonio to fly back to Knoxville via Houston, there was a weather event in Houston, which initially delayed our flight. Unasked, we were put on another flight into Houston. After sitting on the tarmac on that flight for around 2 hours, the pilot stated that the plane was overweight due to fuel, passengers, and baggage, and that they needed volunteers to deplane. The pilot also stated that he had never experienced such a situation in his 25 years of flying. Eventually, enough passengers volunteered to deplane and the flight departed for Houston. Once in Houston, we were informed that our flight to Knoxville had been canceled and rescheduled for the next day. By then, it was around 10 PM. I contacted United customer service via phone while my daughter stood in line at the customer service desk, which eventually closed before she reached the front of the line (there were 85-100 people in line.) The customer service rep I spoke with was hateful and rude, and informed me that, because our flight was canceled ""due to weather"", we could request cots to sleep in the airport or we could get our own hotel. We got an Uber to a hotel and spent the night, and arrived back at the airport the next day. The new flight went from Houston to Dulles. At Dulles, we boarded a very small Embraer via stairs from the tarmac. It was raining and the metal stairs were very slippery. To top it off, when I got to the top of the stairs, the flight attendant told me, very rudely, to go back down the stairs and gate check my backpack, which was the size of a purse. I was wearing two leg braces and barely made it up the steps to begin with because of severe osteoarthritis. The gate agent could have asked me to gate check the backpack. Someone on the ground could have asked me to gate check the backpack. No one did. Just the rude flight attendant. Luckily, my daughter was a few people behind me and could take the backpack back down the stairs. Again, in the rain. After all this, United sent us each a $150 travel voucher. That is the last thing we want. We do not plan to fly United again, under any circumstances.",-1

I got on the flight in San Francisco with my hand luggage and the crew member said they need to check it in due to the aircraft being full. I said okay, will it come straight to Toronto. He answered yes. Guess what? I had to ask him for my bag tag, he put someone else’s bag tag on my bag and sent it to Denver. I lost very personal items because of some careless mistake of the crew member. They need to understand that they are dealing with peoples belongings and actually do their job properly. Anyways, the bag was not found. It was said it reached the head office, but nothing after that.  Worst airline ever.",-1

Travelling for 3 days from Germany - Munchen to El Paso Texas. I lost all the connections due to delays, I arrived at my destination with both check in luggage lost. United team from El Paso was promising me that my luggage is located and I will have my luggage before Christmas. they never offer me with any voucher as I arrived with zero clothes and personal items to my final destination. It was before Christmas. I needed to go every second day to airport to check if my luggage was found because on the phone that they gave me they never answered. United team told me that my expenses (for my survival days in my vacation)will be reimbursed and Until today I did not receive any money. I spend a lot of money, lost my luggage and they offered me zero support. One of my luggage ( 10kg) was found after 10 days but the big one (23kg) was never found. And I called so many times, filled claims and I received zero compensation from United. Every time I am calling them they give me a different story of my claim.",-1
2023-02-10,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Melbourne,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,a truly fantastic experience,True,"  I can honestly say the experience was just as good, if not better, than any 5 star airline I have flown. Check in/Bag drop was the most efficient experience I've had with any airline for each part of the journey. No waiting in long lines to get bag tags, it's via self-serve. Each time, staff offered to help us stick on the tags - travelling with 2 young kids, this little gesture was greatly appreciated. It was also very impressive that bags could then be tracked via the United App. We had no issues at all with our luggage. As far as the aircrafts themselves, we had 3x 787s and a 777 over the journey. Planes were clean, and on par to other airlines 787 and 777. No issues at all with our special meals, and staff were friendly, attentive, and very professional - the kids each got a small activity pack as well. Free Wifi for messaging apps (Text only WhatsApp, Messenger etc) on every flight. Pricing for full internet use was very fair. Entertainment was as good as other airlines, with the ability to also play content on our own devices. Staff had headphones for the kids (as opposed to wired earbuds that everyone else got).  I hope your next trip is as good as ours. I'm not one to leave reviews normally, but this was a truly fantastic experience.",1

Flight departed on time and arrived an hour early, crew were efficient and came around often with drinks throughout the flight. Food is below average when compared to other PE products but IFE is among the best if not always easy to use the choice us huge. Had the bulk head seat so there was plenty of room and the seat was comfortable, downside is the location of the headphone jack.

I still had my suitcase because we were late getting to the airport. Went through TSA and was told that I could gate check my suitcase. One of the people checking the tickets was about to let me board, but the other lady was belligerent and was complaining about my suitcase being too heavy. She gave me a hard time and rebooked my flight to where I won’t be arriving until super late. On a scale of 1-5 stars, United gets a -2.",-1
2023-02-08,0.6,Business,Economy Class,Munich to San Francisco,3.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,3,Use would depend on the price,True,"  First time flying United and after reading the reviews I was expecting the worst. Flight was uneventful, departure and arrival were on time, I got lucky in that the seat next to me was empty meaning I had some space, but could have been very cramped otherwise especially for a 12 hr flight. Staff were efficient and came around often with water and several drinks services. Toilets were kept reasonable clean and the entertainment selection was top notch. Let down has to be the food which was average at best and parsimonious in size. Also repeatedly got bumped by the flight attendant when they walked past, not once or twice but the whole flight long. They got me there but have to say that others do it better and had the seat next to me not been empty the rating would be lower. Use would depend on the price.",1
2023-02-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Phoenix,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst customer service ever,True,  Made me check the same bag they allowed me to fly to Fort Lauderdale Florida just a few days prior. We checked to bags so they also charged us a second checked bag fee which was ridiculous as well because my son didn’t check a bag so it should have been first checked bag which would have been 15 dollars cheaper! They charged us 75$ for a bag that was within there dimensions specified and we didn’t have to check prior! My fiancé called support and that told here all these hopes we had to jump through for them to make it right! Worst customer service ever and now pretty much told us they won’t refund it! While the staff on the actual plane were amazing! This just put a super bad taste in our mouth the lady at the desk for where we boarded could easily see all the information that we didn’t have a first bag check for my son and was super rude and was just trying to stick it to use. Everything in the bag including the bag wasn’t worth 75$ it was a ridiculous unnecessary up charge for now reason when it fit under the seat! Complete scam and trying to make money off people. Do the people at the desk get bonuses for making people check a bag because that’s what it felt like.,-1

My tray table was defective and slanted downward so food and drink would slide off toward me. I brought it to my FAs attention and her solution was lifting my leg up to hold the tray in place. Food was terrible. Flight entertainment was good.,1

2023-01-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Bonaire to Houston via Detroit,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,incompetent running of an airline,False," Flew from Bonaire to Houston to change aircraft from Houston to Detroit. We'll to make it short, flying into Houston they announced they had to go around Houston until a severe weather storm was at Houston Airport had passed. Going around not a cloud in the sky and landing everything was dry a calm. Due to United's incompetent running of an airline they had an aircraft at our gate that was the real reason for flying around. We missed our connecting flight and we had to fly Delta to Detroit no thanks from United. They still haven't a clue where our bags are and couldn't care less. Never again will we fly United.",-1
2023-01-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tucson to Denver,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,Worst experience ever,True,"  Worst experience ever. Seats I paid extra for where not given to me and when I went to the United service counter I was told they could do nothing for me. (I was also traveling with a 3 year old and a 7 month old) My party of 6 was spread throughout the plane, even my 3 year old, and United said there was nothing they could do. I purchased a padded stroller bag and when I received my stroller off the luggage belt, the handle was broke in half. I went directly to the United desk again and was told there was nothing they could do. They have zero customer help and don’t stand behind there mistakes. Will never fly this airline again.",-1

2023-01-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Quad Cities to Cancun via Chicago,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,Economy Plus a big waste of money,False,  I selected Economy Plus which was a big waste of money. The flight from MLI to ORD there was no beverage service. Cramped seating. No plug in for electronics. Actual flight was uneventful. The flight from ORD to CUN. Again the flight was cramped and seat wouldn't recline. There was a beverage service. No plug in for electronics. I will never pay for premium seats on United. And most likely never fly with them again.,-1
2023-01-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Baltimore,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Customer service is absolutely horrible,True," United Airlines is the new Spirit Airlines. There is an additional charge for every little thing to include carry on. There is also an additional charge for seating regardless of your child's age. When I asked about sitting next to my sons she replied, ""we dont move seats with your type of ticket."" Like I'm some kind of 3rd class citizen. Customer service is absolutely horrible. They lost my luggage tag, threatened to call the police, required my kids and I to leaving the boarding area, go back through security, which made us minutes from missing our flight. I was told that ""if we missed the flight it would be my problem"" even though they were the ones who lost the tag. I had my copy of the tag. We fly 6 or 7 times per year and typically I'll look for a reasonably priced ticket. From now on, I'll pay extra to fly on AA or Delta. Never again with United. Be warned!",-1
2023-01-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Austin to Denver,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,always a significant disappointment,False,  Upgraded my seats to find out they changed planes prior to take off.

Staff is always friendly however the airline itself is always a significant disappointment.,-1

I had booking from Reno to Saskatoon and day of flight they had some technical issues with the airplane so they cancel our flight for the whole day, and gave me a ticket for next day, and from Vancouver to Saskatoon day after that. They waste my three days and didn't gave me any compensation for that. Not recommend and will never travel with United again.",-1
2023-01-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Kona,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,I forget how bad they are,False,"  When it's been a few years since I flew with United, I forget how bad they are and I give them another try to see if things have changed. We missed our flight with Hawaiian and needed to get to Hawaii the same day so we booked the next flight out with United, and my partner paid for Premium economy/economy plus or whatever they call the step above economy. He then got a notification that he was refunded due to an error and so he tried again and again with he same problem each time. We go to check in for our flight and the person checking us in says that there are multiple premium/plus seats available but that he can't upgrade us and our best bet is to ask the reps at the gate. We get there and I explain that I'm looking to upgrade to premium economy and the woman working the gate looks at me and scoffs and says we don't have that on this flight. I asked if she was sure because I was told something different downstairs and she said, ""yeah"" as if I was a moron. I left and the whole interaction didn't sit well with me so I went back to ask a different rep to upgrade and I told her that I looked online and saw that this particular aircraft does have a step above economy and that it's called economy plus and not premium economy which I had said before because I normally fly with Eva, Hawaiian, etc. And those airlines call those seats by a different name than United does. I explained that I had called it a different name so maybe she didn't understand what I was asking for before (trying to give her the benefit of the doubt) and the same woman as before interjects and laughs at me saying,"" yeah it's called economy plus, we don't have that other thing you asked for"". Unbelievably and unnecessarily rude. What is the point of nit picking about what name I'm using when you obviously know I'm trying to pay for an upgrade? Right after this stupid and mind-numbing interaction, they announce the flight is delayed. They then get back on the speaker and say actually your gate was moved. Then we get to the gate and learn that our flight was delayed again for maintenance and to get a new plane I never fly any other airlines that delay flights like this, but every time I fly with united, without fail, our flight is delayed. I hate them and don't know how they're still in business. We got on our flight and the staff was rude and short with us until they realized that we had given the whole crew some chocolates to share, and then they changed their tune.",-1
2023-01-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SeattletoJacklsonville via Denver,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,Overall worst flights,True,  I have flown by United before but this time was awful. Just because you want to save money and fly economy doesn't mean we should be stuck in seats that are sized for a scrawny 10 year old. No leg room at all. I'm 5'4 and weigh approximately 140lbs. My knees were all the way to the seat in front of me. They expect you to put personal items under the seat in front of you but you can't bend down to pick anything up. The thing I hated the most was trying to charge my phone. It's under your seat and not a single one worked. Where it's located I'm sure has been kicked a million times. Overall worst flights. If you are a bigger person skip United or fork out for 1st class. The only nice part was getting off the planes and the crew were nice.,-1

This flight was supposed to be 2 stops, and 23 hour flight. It is now 3 stops, 3 delays and 60 hours so far and I'm still sitting waiting. And all the weather is good. I though to give them a second chance since they fail me before, I was stupid. You had been warned. No more United Airlines.",-1

Had 40 hours at the airports, online agents are very incompetent. Customer service agent didn’t even bother to help us, after so many complains and emails no help was given. Basically thanks to incompetence of the workers of United airlines I took a hit for extra $3500. Not anymore booking with this company, horrible customer service and horrible experience.",-1
2023-01-14,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Great Falls to Indianapolis,,,,,,,1,It was horrible,False,"  I had to fly United to get back home and while checking in I found my flight canceled. When I called to rebook, I was given no customer service. Then was told I had to wait 48 hours to get a flight out. I paid my fair like everyone else and should have been on the next flight out. Instead I was further inconvenienced twice: first when I told the agent I needed to get back and my job was on the line and he dismissed it. Secondly when I had to book another airline (at twice as much) that took me 14 hours to get home (Great Falls to Seattle to Denver RED EYE (was canceled) then trying Dallas RED EYE (was canceled) then Chicago then to Indianapolis. I work in customer Service for Hilton and work full time in IT. That is not how you do business or customer service. I will be telling others about this experience. It was horrible.",-1
2023-01-14,0.3,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Berlin to Newark,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,4.0,4,annoyed by the rudeness of the pilot,True,"  I was not able to check in 24 hours in advance as my e-mail requested so I arrived at the airport early. I was asked several security questions and when I received my boarding pass it had at the top, SSSS, which means give him enhanced security at the gate. Going through security I received the normal security which means a body scanner, and many pat downs. I went to the lounge and the only hot food was tater tots and mushrooms. They did have wine. I would recommend the Lufthansa Lounge. Make sure you do not go through Passport Control, or it will be too late to get to the lounge. I went to the gate early and United uses the only gate in Terminal B that has Body Scanners. When they saw my boarding pass, I had to go through the Body Scanner, many pat downs and all of my carry-ons were checked. Make sure you do not purchase any liquids at Duty Free if you have SSSS on your boarding pass. The entire process took about five minutes. I was on the plane almost an hour early. When it was time to depart, the fasten seatbelt sign came on and we waited another hour as every five minutes another frustrated person arrived on the plane. The fasten seatbelt sign went off after 90 minutes and lunch was served. I had the braised beef. Service and food were excellent as I was in Business Class. When I asked the flight attendant why the flight was delayed an hour his response was, I don't know. After the dishes were collected, the fasten seatbelt sign came on not once but twice, not because of turbulence but because too many people were trying to use the toilet. Note to United, turning on the fasten seatbelt sign doesn't empty my bladder. The plane was full, no empty seats. One hour before landing, the pilot said, we are expecting turbulence in Newark so we will be preparing the plain for landing early. Toilets were locked, seats had to be upright and tray tables needed to be up. There was no turbulence arriving in Newark and I have flown with this pilot before. Five feet before arriving at the gate, the pilot made the announcement that we are five feet from the gate and already 28 people have their seat belt unfastened. I took this flight three months ago and I'm still annoyed by the rudeness of the pilot. Most airlines say thank you for flying with us.",-1
2023-01-13,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to San Francisco,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,3,This time definitely hit a new low,True,"  We took a two week trip to Tokyo in Dec 2022 and Jan 2023. Flying with United was the worst part of the trip. First, our flight to Japan was delayed due to ""mechanical issues"" with the aircraft. What was supposed to leave at 10:35am left at 7pm. Second, on our flight back to SFO, they damaged our checked bag. Our luggage (large, hard outer-case suitcase weighing less than 50lb) came out of the carousel about 70 minutes after arrival (along with everyone else's), and it had severe cracks that rendered the suitcase completely unusable in the future (the inner padding was exposed). I tried to tell an agent about this, but no one was present at the United counter at baggage claim. I chatted with an agent on United website about this, but without any apology, she told me to go to a different terminal to see an agent. Who wants to drag a broken luggage across a sprawling airport after a 10-hour flight? In comparison, when a similar thing happened to me on an American Air flight, I was quickly reimbursed for the damage. United has great entertainment onboard and their planes are state-of-the-art, but I have never had a pleasant experience with United as a customer. This time definitely hit a new low.",-1
2023-01-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Rio de Janeiro via Houston,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,2,cares nothing about good service,True,"  Our plane was delayed in arriving in Chicago, and so our flight to Houston was delayed. However, if the Chicago gate crew had given a crap at all, they would have gotten us to Houston in time for our connecting flight to Rio. However, they had one guy retrieving 17 different wheel chairs, one at a time from the cargo area. But worse than that, the gate crew couldn't not have moved slower without backing up. It was painful to watch them eventually start to scan 300+ passengers with one hand-held scanning device that required two or three attempts to get it to work on each and every passenger. They so clearly didn't care! When I got to Houston I raced across the airport only to find that they had held our plane for us for 1 1/2 hours, but left 20 minutes before we got there. They just couldn't wait any longer. But we could have made it with even the slightest concern from the slackers in Chicago. The Chicago crew cares nothing about good service. Clearly there are no consequences to the staff for horrible service. This is a management problem!",-1

I had a connection flight from Istanbul airport to Chicago airport and then San Diego, and the employee at Chicago airport told us that we should carry our bags and then check it in again, I didn't know what is the reason to transfer baggage where i had a final destination at San Diego airport, but when I carried my bags and brought them to the employee in order to get the receipt and gave them to the employee who works on the tracks to push the bags in, I told him to be careful when throwing them on the tracks, but the employee looked at me in the eye and threw the bag upside down, and I asked him ""why did you do that?"" He did not answer at all! These negative behaviors must be dealt with because they reflect the name and reputation of the airline.",-1
2023-01-06,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to London via Newark,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolute nightmare of an experience,True,"  I was on a flight from Columbus Ohio connecting via Chicago to London. Not only did I experience delay after delay - 3.5 hours delay, they have also had to rebook my tickets twice because of this. I’ve had to fly visa Newark to get back to London. And after a long and painful flight, having returned to London Heathrow, they have lost my two checked luggages! United Airlines baggage enquiry staff told me that one of my luggages was in London and made me wait for four hours looking at carousels from other flights, in the end, I went home with zero luggage. They said my luggage will be delivered the day after, but the contact number they have provided to track your lost luggage does not work, very hard to get ahold of United Airlines customer service. What an absolute nightmare of an experience I have had. Very poor service. I will never fly with United again.",-1

On the way to the airport our last connecting flight gets cancelled, booked the “Plan B” they had available. Get to our first stop in Denver then from Denver over to LA. The boarding pass stated from Denver to San Francisco, 6 hr destination error. I am not supposed to be in LAX to begin with. I claim my baggage only to check it back in to send it to Melbourne & I notice a huge slit in my luggage, completely torn apart, I will not be surprised if I’m not reimbursed even partially for this damage. Finally here at my gate that was initially supposed to take off at 4pm, then got delayed to 6.45pm then to 7.30pm. It’s a connecting flight to San Fran to get us to Melbourne, which takes off at 11pm, so another delay is going to cut it very close. Lo and behold, a 3rd delay to 1am! Awesome experience. Not to mention, all the delays came with gate changes. Cancelled flights, delayed flights, damaged personal belongings, & we are in a city we didn’t plan to be in. Any reimbursement? Of course, not to worry, we got an offer of $75 credit towards United Airlines, very generous.",-1

It was interesting to watch how some customers were being helped and others were simply not. Shame on you United Airlines.",-1
2023-01-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Tokyo Narita to Houston,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,seat was very comfortable,True,"  Boarding was uneventful and the seat was very comfortable and spacious, probably the best premium economy seat I've been in. It had good back support, a storage area in the armrest and good storage under the IFE screen, which was quite large. We were given a nice large blanket and a good sized pillow. The food service was excellent, served on china with a cloth napkin and wine. We had dinner and breakfast and both meals were very good. IFE was okay, with enough to watch. We were supplied regularly with water and drinks throughout the 11 hour journey. Staff weren't the most interactive but were friendly and accomodating. We took off on time and arrived early into Houston. The toilets were shared with economy and were spotless. I had a look at the economy seats and they were very cramped in a  
3-4-3 arrangement. All in all, United did not disappoint in PE",1
2023-01-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Fort Lauderdale to Brussels via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,stop using Covid as an excuse,False," Very disappointed. Especially traveling after Covid. This airline has been reducing customer service, the staff are rude, I had an awful sleep in Business Class. Traveling after Covid has been a disaster. At Fort Lauderdale, the United Club lounge was disgusting, limited food, using plastic cutlery instead of metal, not enough drinks, cramped and noisy space. United ruined the start of 2023, after 3 bad years due to Covid. It seems like Air Canada and United Airlines have been downgrading their services during Covid and using ""Covid"" as an excuse for poor customer service. I am so upset with all of the airlines I flew during the Christmas holidays. I am going to avoid Etihad Airways, Air Canada and United Airlines because they were the reason for creating a bad start to 2023. I wish the United Airlines team can learn from Singapore Airlines, when you fly with Singapore Airlines, the service is outstanding and relaxing, also the planes are clean on SIA. This is a bad example of travel after 3 years of Covid. This is not good enough and a horrible start to 2023. These airlines need to buck up and stop using Covid as an excuse.",-1
2023-01-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bentonville to Bozeman,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst airline experience,True,"  I recently flew with United Airlines and it was the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. I was flying out of XNA in Bentonville, AR, and connecting through Denver to then fly to Bozeman, MT. Our flight out of XNA was delayed 30 minutes (which wasn’t a huge deal), and as we got closer to Denver, the flight attendant informed us that they were not going to land in Denver, we were being redirected to Montrose, CO, due to low visibility. We were told we were going to land and be back up in the air shortly and that we were just waiting for the weather to clear. We then had to de-board the plane and wait inside a very small airport that had 5 total gates and 1 terminal. More and more flights being redirected from Denver were landing there and caused the terminal to be so crowded that it was difficult to walk around without getting stuck in a crowd of people. We waited for 3 1/2 hours while only being told to not book a hotel room, and that United was going to get us back to Denver soon. This entire time, we were tracking other United planes that were landing in Denver hours before we were able to fly back. Finally, we re-boarded the plane and flew back to Denver, where the conditions were worse than when we originally attempted to land there. Once we landed in Denver, we spoke to a United Airlines agent because we had just found out that instead of rebooking us on a new flight, they just decided to cancel our boarding passes for the connecting flight to Bozeman without notifying us, that we missed due to the wait in Montrose. We were told we could not be put on another flight until January 4th (it was January 2nd when this all happened) and that the 2 checked bags we had on the plane could either be claimed at the baggage claim, or shipped to Bozeman after we arrive, but would not get there for 2-3 days after we arrived. We decided we would schedule a flight with a different airline for that night, and go down to the baggage claim to get our bags. We were told that United had submitted the request for our bags to be pulled and it would be 1-2 hours before they would end up on the baggage claim carousel. We sat and waited for 4 hours and still did not receive our bags. By the time we reached Bozeman, United had cost us over half a day of travel that cut into our vacation time, and large amounts of stress and annoyance. I will never fly with United again, and hope that anyone who flys with them does not have the same experience I had.",-1

I called them and they told my that my ticket is cancelled without any notice! They told me I should get a new one and i did and purchased a 5 new tickets. Everytime same thing happens! This is the worst experience in my whole life and I will never use United again.",-1

I can't give enough praise to United for the wonderful service we experienced flying out to Denver and back to Eugene, Oregon. The flight out was slightly delayed, but it did not affect our trip. The flight attendants were friendly and personable and certainly made me pause and try to remember when I last had this kind of attention. They were very sorry for the delay and were sincere in the service they provided as a result. A special call-out to flight attendant on the return flight UA318 from Denver to Eugene. He engaged with everyone on the flight in a way that will certainly bring me back for future flights. You need to know when you get it right. You most definitely did for my family and me for this trip. Keep it up!",1

Plane finally gets boarded, been here for an hour still haven’t even left the terminal. Ruined my ride for when I get home, ruined everything.",-1
2023-01-01,0.9,Business,Premium Economy,Houston to Vancouver,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,best choice for frequent fliers,False," Being a frequent flier, I have used all US airlines and many International airlines - to name few - United, Continental, American, Delta, Southwest, West Jet, Spirit, Air Canada, Qatar, Emirates, Gulf, ANA, JAL, Turkish, Mexican, China Southern, Air India, Indian Airlines, Jet Airways, Kingfisher, Sahara, Indigo, Thai, Air Asia, Singapore, British Airways, Swiss, etc. Like everything else, no airline is perfect, however the way United manages its resources and keeps 'on-time performance' is phenomenal and commendable. Another big differentiator for United is its automation - United is several step ahead in automation. This made a clear distinction during December 2022 Arctic freeze in North American continent - when airlines like Southwest could not schedule its pilots and dumped customers' luggage wherever they could. United kept most of its services intact with minimum disruption and maximum on-time performance; also United system is able to tell every customer where his luggage is at any point in his trip. The way and with speed at which United came out of COVID-19 was also seamless and shows its resilience. United's cleanliness during pandemic was way superior than others. Its safety video has always been worth watching. Its pricing is mostly very competitive even on routes not originating at its hubs. And usually its customer service responds on feedbacks which they ask for every trip. Overall the best choice for frequent fliers who value their time.",1
2022-12-31,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Knoxville,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,big thank you to United Airlines,True,"  I just like to say big thank you to United Airlines, for taking care for me and my sister to rebook new flight after we got late to our flight because flight from Germany got delayed over 1 hr. We got free hotel room, free lift to drive us to hotel, and pickup us back to airport + $30 each for dinner and breakfast .Thank you so much, great people, look forward to go back again with United Airlines.",1
2022-12-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Minneapolis,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,another flight that has been delayed 3 hours,False,"  I was to leave 9.35pm Christmas Day. After a 5 hour delay boarding the place and several people taken off because people who paid more for their ticket took their place, the flight was cancelled and we had to get off. Then we stood in line with people from other United flights including an international flight for 3 hours to get rebooked. Now after a week of getting new flights booked and flights canceled not to mention the cost of hotels etc, I am sitting at the airport again waiting for another flight that has been delayed 3 hours. At what point, is United responsible for finally getting me home!!",-1
2022-12-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Casper Wyoming to Las Vegas via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Slept on the airport with kids,False,"  First flight was delayed 12 hours. Connecting flight was delayed 20 hours. Been tossed around from one end of the terminal to another 6 times. Slept on the airport with kids, no assistance given. On our trip back, our flight was canceled because apparently we were a ‘no show’ in our connecting flight to our final destination! Since we were a no-show, and flight being canceled, there were no available flights anymore until after 3 days!",-1
2022-12-30,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Milan,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"terrible, completely disrespectful",True," Long story short, they were delayed the flight for a few hours, giving us some weird “hopes” and sharing some “progress” they are making in order to make our flight, and then just cancelled it. They did exactly the same when I was flying from Munich to San Francisco. It is terrible, completely disrespectful. I completely do not recommend United Airlines.",-1
2022-12-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,has to be some type of accountability,True," I never got on my flight on Christmas Eve because I wouldn’t have been able to make my connecting flight. I have been on the phone with the United Airlines call center multiple times with 3-4 hour wait times and meanwhile one of my bags has been on 5 flights and the other bag has been on 4. I also went to Newark airport to collect my bags and they told me to go home because the wait time would be too long and that the call center in India has no clue as to what’s going on in the United States. It’s now 4 days later and one of my bags is in Newark airport and the other bag is sitting in Houston. I have my medication in my bags and the call center told me to take myself to the emergency room to get medication. There has to be some type of accountability. I will never fly United Airlines and if you can’t trust them with your luggage, how could you trust them with your life.",-1

2022-12-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Green Bay,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,Both planes were dirty,False," United use to be a premium airline when you book united you felt this is going to be great. NOT ANY LONGER! Both planes were dirty and the seats were like flying on a discount carrier which I will not fly because of comfort. Flight crew was very unput together clothes look dishevelled hair unkept, Not customer oriented (they acted as this is the worst job ever). Just paid 700 for 800 mile flight. Asked for a Diet Coke only allowed one glass not even the can and no stupid snack really. I fly once every other week this was my first flight with United in a year they can not even compare to Delta or American. I will no longer book with united delta and American has my business or I could use another airport and fly a discount carrier which would match the service and uncomfortable plane literally felt like I was sitting in a plywood bench. I was unable to load my payment info on the app so was unable to use my credit card to even purchase a drink. Then the connection from Chicago they did not provide a beverage service, both other carriers on this route do offer. Very very unhappy with the price and the lack of service provided. I have instructed my husband who owns a travel company based in Philly not avoid booking me on the carrier.",-1
2022-12-27,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Tampa to Newark,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,needs to get its staff scheduling right,True,"  United needs to get its staff scheduling right. Both routes from Newark and Tampa, the flight attendant went missing for hours! This is the first time flying for over 30 yrs I have had this situation where the airline unable to even find backup! Anyway, from Tampa to Newark the flight was delayed by 4 hrs. The plane sat at the gate for at least 3 hrs so one would expect the cleaning service done properly right. Not in the case of United. I found filthy face mask inside the seat pouch and all over the seat and hand rest - crumbs of pretzels and cookies! There is no quality check and I don’t know how people still able to keep their job stating form the management of United. I thought Air India was worst but this airlines take the top spot of being worst. Only way it’s surviving is due to the sheer volume of demand from people in the US traveling.",-1
2022-12-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Auckland via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Do not fly with them,False,"  Topped the list of worst airline. 4 delayed flights, one cancelled, said they rebooked us onto a new flight the next day (turns out they didn’t). New flight, delayed again, customer service is shocking. Didn’t know where our bags were. The common sense of these people turns out to be not that common. Do not fly with them.",-1
2022-12-27,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Juan,2.0,,3.0,,,2.0,2,shocked at the incompetence,False," Flight from Boston to Newark cancelled xmas night when we were to fly out at 6 am the next day. Drove to Newark Christmas night, bought rooms in the Hilton hotel across from airport, just to find out that we had been kicked off the second leg of our flight (Newark to San Juan) at 6 am the next morning. We had called United when driving down to Newark to say that we would make our flight and were assured that we were still on it, but clearly this was not the case. Staff was incredibly calm and helpful, got us on a flight at 8 PM (12 hours later) - however, this flight was just pushed back 2 hours (as of now, hopefully not even more) and we are now arriving at 3 am. The amount of money that has been thrown away so far is absolutely ridiculous, and for it to take 1.5 days to get somewhere that is a 6 hour flight away is just unacceptable. I understand the bad weather and the delays, but I am just shocked at the incompetence of a well-known airline. Newark staff and United Club attendants have been very helpful, but United Airlines itself is bottom level and I will not be flying again. To spend over 14 hours in an airport from Christmas to Monday night is horrible, especially with the money being spent on flights alone.",-1
2022-12-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Corpus Christi to New York via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Will never fly United again,False,  Poor customer service. Delayed luggage. The employees at the claim office closed at midnight and left customers standing there. The only employee left there told everyone to leave and return the following day at 4 am. Called the claim center the following day (Christmas Day) 4 times to be put on hold for 1-2 hour each time. Spent Christmas without my luggage. Will never fly United again,-1

The flight was delayed for mechanical reasons by increments announcing delays virtually every 15 minutes - this caused my daughter, son in law, $ toddler to finally leave the airport at 7: 00pm having waited at EWR ten hours hours not knowing if the flight would be ultimately canceled. So I’m missing my family after being through United Hell. We were so sick & exhausted when we arrived at PBI & had to wait for luggage at 12:30 am. We need a REFUND or vouchers.. & the poor abused gate people got no updated info ever! Delays presented every 15 minutes for 10 hours!",-1
2022-12-25,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Austin via Houston,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,They waived change fees,False,"  Kudos to United for their thoughtfulness. They waived change fees in advance of expected bad weather during Christmas travel. Changes were not dependent on their cancellations but based on traveller needs. Changes were also easy to make, they took less than ten minutes on line. United delayed the flight from Houston to Austin by 20 minutes to allow late arrivals to board the Christmas Eve flight. On the Austin side the flight was only 10 minutes late. The Houston to Austin seats were large and comfortable.",1
2022-12-25,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Newark,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,2,They say our luggage will follow,False,"  Flying on Dec 24 at 12.15 pm they announce that they rebook passengers to the next flight (1.30 pm) because of a technical problem but in fact the second flight is empty so we suspect that this was in fact the reason. I had paid 200€ to have more space for the legs but I am relocated in a normal seat. They say our luggage will follow but arriving at Newark they say the luggage will arrive later, that we need to file a claim at the office. A 200 m queue is already formed. The app say we can place a claim online. We leave the airport to be on time for the family Christmas diner. The way to place the claim cannot be found online. Indeed the app says we must return to the airport. Customer care announces 60 minutes wait. We return to the airport at 6 am on the 25th. The line is still long. We are in the queue.",-1
2022-12-25,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Denver,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,I cannot stand United Airlines,False,"  United Airlines has always been my preferred airlines until what happened today. The plane was not flown out to San Diego because they had no pilot to bring it there, and they then lied saying it was an earlier flight delay. Luckily, our pilot on our flight told us all the truth. I cannot stand United Airlines as I missed my next flight afterwards because the first flight was delayed around 3.5 hours.",-1
2022-12-22,0.3,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,SYD to LNK via DEN,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,1,extending my trip by 22 hours,False, Technical problem on an old 757 on LAX-DEN on 12/22 which was delayed then cancelled extending my trip by 22 hours via red eye LAX-ORD and then ORD-LNK on 12/23 afternoon. Had to rebook twice (first rerouting was also cancelled via Houston). 44 hours trip. Did not offer any compensation (club access or hotel night). So so airline!,-1
2022-12-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boise to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst flight of my life,True,"  Worst flight of my life. They overbooked the flight, then blamed the passengers for not giving up their seats. The gate attendant kept telling us we were passing up a great deal completely tone deaf to the consequences of what they were asking. She then started singing Christmas songs over the intercom. We were then stranded on the plane for over an hour because they couldn't figure how to fix a ""minor"" issue. The cabin was sweltering too. I hope United gets a bag of coal for Christmas.",-1
2022-12-20,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to San Antonio,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,Flight was nice and comfortable,True,  Flight was nice and comfortable. Pilots were informative about flying conditions and excelled in their professionalism. FAs were attentive to needs in cabin. I was given a seat upgrade owing to me being the first to gate check my carryon. Wifi and entertainment were operative with top notch catalog. Gate agents were nice and professional.,1
2022-12-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Los Angeles via Denver,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,declined substantially over the last year,False,"  I have flown United twice in the last year, the most recent being yesterday, December 16, 2022. It seems that the quality of both service and equipment declined substantially over the last year. Yesterday I was moved almost to tears when we were kept in the plane for 2 hours while preflight checks revealed an equipment problem, diagnostics were run, and it was determined that a part needed to be located locally (supposedly someone was going to run to the local airline parts store!). Thank heaven we had not left the gate. Instructions to passengers were that we could leave the plane, but all possessions had to be taken off as well. Those of us who chose to forego this opportunity in the hope that this was going to be a short event spent two hours waiting, only to be told that we were then required to leave the plane and had to take our possessions off. In the terminal chips, water and soda were handed out -- no vouchers for a decent sandwich or salad -- nothing healthy. We were one hour in the terminal, then another 45 minutes in the re-loading process. The seat width and legroom were atrocious. With almost no legroom, some seats still had the reclining capability and the lady in front of me was reclined almost in my lap. The seat pocket was tiny and held almost nothing. I never did find any charging capability for my devices and the attendant was not even sure where the ports were; luckily I brought an old fashioned book. All told, all of the legs of my Norfolk to LA round-trip were miserable because of the quality of the plane and service, but the last leg was extra-ordinarily hellish. I got home at 3:15 this morning. While I complain here about United, I used American Airlines in September and experienced similar treatment (an unapologetic 3-hour delay with no food after all services in the airport were closed, unconscionably tight seats and few amenities). We are treated like unloved dogs by the airlines while paying high prices (my cross-country trip cost over $600 for economy -- more when counting payment for the privilege of selecting my seat, for checking a bag -- because I knew there would be little to no overhead space for even a small bag, and for using the plane's WIFI). Meanwhile, the airlines make record profits by packing passengers in, cutting the numbers of available flights, and providing no real amenities. God help us!",-1

I was traveling to Germany to see my two sons and in Amsterdam watched as I was moved over two days to one cancelled flight to another. The flight in was horrible, worst staff and food I ever experienced. In Chicago they made us stay on our plane 5 hours on the tarmac. When we got to Amsterdam the crew vanished. There was no support, no help, no representatives. I had to take trains and finally pay a driver to take me into Dusseldorf to ensure I made my visit with my children. Sure enough even the flights the following two days were cancelled. The worst was they never provided any food or lodging.",-1

When we checked in my boyfriend was not required to pay for the bag. When we start boarding the lady I’m the front stated we had to pay. I was letting her know that the first ticket we received and when we checked In we were told we didn’t have to pay. Please keep in my mind I was very polite. This lady was so rude telling me she will not let me board and making threats. I have never experienced such anger or unprofessional conduct in my years of flying.,-1

It was one hour delay in LA at starting point and one hour delay in Landing (finding gates) We were just waiting on the flight for checkout. I feel they don't plan the trips properly ahead of schedule.,-1
2022-12-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to São Paulo,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2,Points to improve cleanliness,True,"  Points to improve cleanliness: I found a piece of bread in a box with butter all green of mold under my seat. I don't know how long was sitting there but it was really disgusting. The restrooms were not cleaned during the trip. I saw a spot of toothpaste in the sink first time I went to the restroom, at the end of the trip I went to the restroom and the spot was still there. Breakfast was terrible, I'm lactose intolerant and there was only a yogurt and a piece of sweet hard bread. No fruit, no bread. During the trip the glasses of water in the bar at the back of the plane turned over because of the turbulence and it was a mess. I wonder why don't they offer bottle of water. Unfortunately the space for carry on luggage in this airplane is smaller, there was a lot of confusion because there was no space everyone to place their carry on luggage. We took longer to depart due to the confusion of people trying to place their carry on luggage. One good point was the wifi, it worked very well.",-1
2022-12-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,San Francisco to Albuquerque,4.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1,catering United Airlines Offers is terrible,True,"  Boarding and seat was fine. The catering that United Airlines Offers is terrible - most dishes are vegetarian. The meat dishes are the worst. Bistro Burger with cheese and ham, no condiments (ketchup/mustard). UAL Management, the pandemic is not an excuse for everything. Hire a new Chief Chef please, and this was another UAL flight with no Wi-Fi",-1

2022-12-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Quito to Houston,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,not a good experience,True," I guess it wasn't all bad as we landed safely, but generally not a good experience on our UA2083 flight at 1.35am on 4th Dec 22. My partner's TV controls didn't work, so we shared earphones on my screen, but the earphone port was faulty so we had to jiggle it and hold it at a certain angle for it to work. The shows were on a cable television basis, so we had to watch some shows halfway through. Despite the seat sticker saying charging ports were available, we learnt that there were none. I tried to check in online to book a vegetarian meal, but read that it was not necessary as all UA flights come with vegetarian meal options. That was a lie. Was told there was only chicken, nothing else. They gave me crisps. Upset and hungry, I changed my order of a water to a glass of wine, and the lady with short curly hair smirked, pointed at my partner and I, and said to the other steward, ""we got one of those over here"". One of those? People who drink wine? Asians who drink wine? Well, if I had my vegetarian meal, as promised by UA, I wouldn't be frustrated enough to ask for a wine, lady. Not much baggage space too, had to place our carry ons very far down the plane, so it took us forever to disembark. I really hope my next flight is better, but I'm not banking much hope on it.",-1
2022-12-04,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Newark to San Francisco,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,pick a different airline,True," Boarded early. Pilot said we would have an on time departure. Now we are 55 min delayed due to some problem in the cargo area. Travel often and it seems United is the only airline that doesn't maintain their planes properly, so after multiple delayed trips due to maintenance/repairs I'm leaving a review. Previously had a flight delayed so bad due to malfunctioning overhead panel that we had to deplane and board a different aircraft I don't know how you avoid this other than pick a different airline.",-1
2022-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to San Francisco,,,,,,1.0,1,trying to split up my party,True,  I understand with basic economy there's no guarantee we'll be seated together but they are actively trying to split up my party for no reason other than to nickel and dime their customers. We have 3 travelers and they put one traveler in a row by themselves and 2 travelers in a row where only two seats are being used. This coupled with no ability to check in unless we arrive to confirm our bags. Don't sell basic economy if you don't want people to actually buy it. So I can pay $31 or simply ask the solo person you if you put in that spot to switch with me as it's the same spot 3 rows up and they'll get a row by themselves if you don't put anyone in it.,-1

I didn't find the seat uncomfortable, good selection of entertainment, free wine, friendly flight attendants, flights on time, I even the food was acceptable though certainly not luxurious. This was quite a relief after hearing many horror stories about air travel at the moment. I didn't check luggage.",1
2022-11-27,0.7,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Chicago to Sao Paolo,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,,5.0,3,indifferent staff who needed to be pushed,True,"  What a mixed bag! First the good. After a delayed flight from LGA to ORD we had a very short connection to this flight. I was nervous enough about us making the connection, let alone our suitcase. But we were met at the door of the incoming flight, taken to a car and driven across the airport to our connecting gate giving us breathing room. And - using the really excellent bag-tracking app - I was able to see our suitcase made it from one flight to the other in just 20 minutes! Really excellent service. As opposed to what we experienced in the (crowded) business-class cabin: indifferent staff who needed to be pushed (e.g. nobody offered my wife a dessert!), really surprisingly bad quality food, little choice in wine, and narrow seats - yes they were lie-flat which is really necessary, but they were more like a mummification ritual than a bed! Ten stars for efficiency, 4 stars for in-flight amenities and service averages out at 7 stars overall",-1
2022-11-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Ghana,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,be wary of flying with United Airlines,False,"  My flying experience with United Airlines has been by far my worst travel experience ever!! Not only did my flight to Ghana get diverted to another African country but we were not allowed to depart until the following day, forcing many passengers to sleep in the airport! When I complained and asked for compensation for the night charge I incurred for being a no show at my scheduled hotel in Ghana, United Airlines has yet to contact me regarding my concerns nearly 10 business days later. On my return flight I missed my flight due to customs and I was again forced to pay another $1,700 for an economy seat after being told I could not board my original flight because it was now full and departing in 2 mins. Unless I have no other options I will never fly United Airlines again and I will make my concerns and displeasure known, so other potential passengers can be wary of flying with United Airlines.",-1
2022-11-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Wichita via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,United is impossible to communicate with,False,"  It started with a 12 hour layover in O’Hare. The plane I flew on seemed like it was designed to prevent comfort. United is impossible to communicate with. After a 12 hour layover, my flight was then delayed. On my way back, I managed to avoid a 14 hour layover by getting on a standby flight. My bag did not come with me. When I arrived in Norfolk, the woman at baggage services was very rude and unhelpful. I chatted with a United agent who said my bag was coming on my original flight. I came by the next morning to pick it up and my bag is not there. It was marked incorrectly for an address I do not live at so I had to wait most of the day for it. I hope United goes into bankruptcy so they can stop messing people around. I’ve never paid so much money for a worse experience.",-1

Meals were Mexican casserole or oriental noodles. I asked flight attendant if either meal had cilantro in it and the flight attendant gave me a dirty look and rudely said “I don’t know” with a mean face. So I took the Mexican casserole that she had in her hand , and sure enough it had cilantro in it. So I pushed the attendant button and waited for over 30 minutes and she never came back so I could exchange my meal for the noodle one. So on a 10 hour flight I only had bread for my dinner meal. I bet if I were in first class she would not have spoken to me like that or ignored me, we all are not fortunate enough to fly first class, but I would hope they treat economy customers with respect and dignity.",1

My Flight was delayed 19 hours total. I had to drive back home to sleep the night as my flight was rescheduled the next morning.

They made our move from the east coast to Guam extremely difficult. Because of them we kept getting stuck on Honolulu day after day with no money, no where to stay, no car, our luggage made it to Guam before we did, so of course we didn’t have any clothes either. My husband is active duty military and united has prevented him and his crew from going underway on schedule. Save your time, tears and money and go to a different airline.

I had a trip and they had a good route, so I thought maybe they got better after specifically not flying them for a decade. No, they still suck. The people that work for them are awesome. The delivery of their product/service is the worst. Old planes, delays and cancellations .. they cost me so much time and $ by simply not delivering. So much money and experience they have, you'd think they could deliver, but No. I'll never fly them again.",-1
2022-11-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to San Antonio via Houston,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1,hands off the worst airline,True,"  United is hands off the worst airline. I was traveling to visit my fiancé for thanksgiving. And I had just finished my last final in medical school so I was really happy but United ruined it. It all started when I tried checking in my bag. I am a United credit card holder so logically my first bag is supposed to be free. I tried adding the bag through the app but it kept charging me. So I contacted the customer service who requested me to seek help at the airport kiosk or the staff and reassured that it should be an easy fix. I agreed to it. When I sought help at the airport, the staff including the supervisor proceeds to tell me that I bought my flight with my miles so I am not eligible to check in my bag for free even though I am a card member. I tell them that the customer service rep confirmed that none of that should be a problem. They tell me to bring an email stating that. Now where am I supposed to find an email? I call the customer service again. Again, this is happening an hour and a half prior to my flight. The customer service rep tells me it shouldn’t be a problem. Miles are considered rewards not punishment. I try to hand over the phone to the United staff at MIA and they refuse to talk to him. They keep saying they want to see an email. The customer service rep tells me he can’t send any email other than a generic one per the airline policy. So the United staff at MIA leaves me at that without any help. The customer service rep tells me that I should just pay for the bag and request a refund later. As much as I didn’t want to go through the whole process of requesting a refund and all that, I agreed to it it because I didn’t want to let this ruin my day. Then, I head over to TSA, the nice lady checks my boarding pass and points me to the general line. But this man comes in and asks me to get my ID out before I even enter the line. Note that, there is a huge line at TSA (I am no where close to the TSA guy). I tell him that I have it right here in my hand’s reach but he won’t let me enter the line unless he sees it in my hand. I tell him the line is so long and I don’t want to drop it. Still, he won’t let me go in until he sees my ID in my hand. I have flown so many times in my entire life and I never had anyone stop me at the beginning of line and manhandled me like this. Then at TSA screen, their machine breaks and they lose my mac. I end up finding it in another lane. oh also, my flight gets delayed. I am not exaggerating. This is all happening in the same day. Once I get in the flight, the flight goes smoothly. But now I am worried because the arrival time is too close to the departure time of my connecting flight. Even after everything happened, I was hopeful that United will do its due diligence like every other airline, and hold the flight for at least 10min because that should be enough to get the passengers in from the delayed flight. Also, perhaps that the crew members would help these passengers out first to accommodate the delay. I am sorry but that just has been my experience with American and southwest. They just understood and helped. Little things but made a huge difference. But United did not do any of those. They had zero communications and did not make accommodations. Couple other passengers and I ran 30 gate gates over in 10min just do find that they closed the gate even though there is 10min left, means there was no communication about the delayed flight.

2022-11-16,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Pohnpei to Guam,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5,hands down the best flight,True,"  Of the six flights I took with United, this was the best. No seriously, hands down the best flight. Although we had a really old 737-800 with super old IFE systems and no wi-fi the crew is what made the flight really memorable - the two who were in my section had a great personality, They were interacting with passengers and were really genuine about both service and safety. I really wish more United crew would learn from these two role models. The catering was a chicken sandwich which to be honest was the best and the cheesiest chicken sandwich I had ever had, I really wish United would offer these on HNL-GUM routes too instead of those cold pastas.",1
2022-11-16,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Honolulu,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1,it is just mediocre,False,"  I flew this airline not by choice. I flew from LAX to Honolulu to Guam to Pohnpei and back the same way. The terminal was old and really run down. The terminal post TSA is dull and has absolutely 0 personality pretty much like staff this airline has employed. The aircraft a super old 777-200 took us from LA to Honolulu, the most embarrassing 777-200 I have ever seen in my life, it had no IFE, you had to stream it to your device. The cabin crew were laughable at best, they were all ""aloha"" and ""mahalo"" trying to create a ""vibe"" with flower in their hair etc and it is the most cringe thing I have seen in my life. No matter how hard they try to show they have a personality or try to be friendly it is just evident they are faking it and this is visible in the way they work. They don't come around the cabin with rounds of water, snacks etc, they don't interact with passengers stretching out in the galley etc. Even if you are carrying trash in your hand they will continue talking to each other totally ignoring you until you disturb them and ask. I am not saying the airline is bad, but it is not good either, it is just mediocre, literally buses with wings.",-1

Attendants stated I had to go to their website and enter credit card numbers to pay to get WiFi. Ridiculous and can’t believe I had to pay in the first place and then put credit card numbers on line. What happened to the tickets we paid for? Doesn’t that count? It’s not the cost but the principal. Attendants would not help to download the app. I am 77 yrs old and not computer literate and could have used assistance. They were abrupt and not respectful to a customer who paid for tickets.

Twice I had to wait for an agent. There were so many people who needed assistance. I was running out of time then my final message was to line up to ‘additional services’. It was a super long line. Only 3 counters open. By the time it was my turn, they said I need to rebook as I was late. So they booked me next day. No charge. LAX to Honolulu  5 hours no food but a small cookie.

I won’t say all staff, the flight attendants and one very nice and helpful agent named Alby T are the only ones to mention as a superstar ! The rest I came in contact with were unhelpful and couldn’t care less about you as a person. I arrived in Denver to catch my connection only to wait on delays and then be cancelled, while I was trying to rebook another flight the airline took it upon themselves to automatically book me on another flight the next day, I never asked for this! Once That was done they reopened the original flight and then tried to ask me why I changed it because this flight was now booked and I couldn’t get back on! They kicked me off the flight, I would assume to attend to their premium customers, and then tried to blame it on me. After 5 different gates on standby without success they flat out refused to give me a voucher or hotel room and just expected me to sleep on the floor in the airport. This was not in any way my fault, they booted me off the flight and sold the seat to someone else! Bait and switch? I think so. They don’t care that I’m disabled, my medication is in the bag they made me check and I can barely walk after 15 hours in an airport! If you have a choice, book with someone else and ask them what would happen if this happened to you before you book! 4 flights later, here I sit in the Denver airport wondering what spot on the floor I can sleep on. Been up since 3am and now it’s 8.",-1
2022-11-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Honolulu to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,Awful experience,True," Honolulu to Los Angeles. My 1st time flying United Airlines and one thing is sure, I will never take United airlines ever! Took the 9:40pm flight on Nov 2, 2022, thinking that I'll be able to take a good rest during the 5-hour flight from HNL to LAX. I was all wrong. All throughout the flight, the attendants gathered in the galley and talked and gossiped and laughed loudly. The attendants never had the sensitivity to all those passengers seated next to the galley, the flight being an overnight flight, talking loudly and laughing endlessly. At one point I made eye contact with an attendant who was an active participant, to signal discreetly that that the noise was annoying. She looked at me and kept quiet for a sec and resumed talking, gossiping and laughing again shortly. What was unbelievable was when the Captain announced that we were landing shortly and followed by another announcement asking the attendants to take their seat, 2 attendants continued gossiping across the aisles loud enough for both these 2 attendants could hear each other. They ensured they did! Unbelievable. I reported this on my way out when I chanced upon the Captain by the door. The Captain responded, ""I will let them know"". I hope the Captain really addressed my complaint. Awful experience I've had on this flight. United Airlines NOT RECOMMENDED!",-1
2022-11-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Paris,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst airline possible,False,"  If you enjoy flying the worst airline possible, fly United Airlines! We flew out of San Francisco bound for Paris. It was to be our very first time in Paris. We only had 6 days available, so we wanted to make the most of it. We had friends that were there and we were going to meet them for dinner that evening of our arrival. We have not seen these friends for years. The flight to Paris had to land in Newark due to mechanical difficulties. We were made to wait in Newark for 4 hours while a new crew arrived for the new aircraft we would be flying. While we waited for 4 hours they gave us water and chips, what a joke. Upon the arrival of the new crew, the ground crew began the boarding process. It was at this time that they realized that the computers were not working and they could not use the electronic boarding system. Why they did not check this out while we waited 4 hours and they sat around laughing and having a great time, so we waited an additional 30 minutes while they tried to figure that out. Eventually they realized that they would not be able to board us electronically, so they did it manually. It was utter chaos, like the blind leading the blind. We finally boarded the new aircraft, and guess what, that aircraft had mechanical difficulties, so we waited another hour while they fixed that and fueled the aircraft. Why they didn't check the aircraft and fueled it while it sat there for 4 hours is beyond me. We were supposed to arrive in Paris at 10am, but landed at 8pm. By the time we arrived at the hotel it was 10:30pm. Why 2.5 hours to get from the airport to the hotel you ask? Our luggage, for some strange reason took almost an hour after the aircraft landed to reach us after we landed. Then of course there was the traffic in the evenings in Paris. Had we landed at 10am we would have been to our hotel by 11am. The delay caused us to miss our reservation at the Louvre Museum. Nothing was available until the end of November, long after we were gone. We were never able to see our friends, since they flew out the next morning, and we missed an entire day of our vacation. All and all, quite possibly the single worst experience I have ever had with any airline. As a point of reference, I am in my late 60's and have flown on many airlines.

That was hours on the phone trying to fix .. then we got delayed on departure so missed our connection flight in Houston so they rebooked me on a late flight with my husband on standby. Gave us a meal voucher that said"" sorry for the delay but enjoy a meal on us"" and it was $15.00. You can't even buy 2 bottles of water for £15.00.

I tried to use that ticket to book a new fight but they had zero direct flights and I would have gotten there too late. I just canceled it and called when things settled down.

I had a non-stop and then a bait and switch to a stop in Newark, NJ! Their 'Economy' option turned out to be more expensive than 1st class and let's be honest...no one travels without luggage so an extra $70 to take luggage is ludicrous! If you can't take a carry-on, you should be allowed to check a bag for free! The worst part of this trip was the customer service after a delay in take-off caused several passengers to miss their connecting flights. A group of us went together to 'Customer Service' to be reassigned a new connecting flight. The group of us who went all got different agents. The others were quickly reassigned a new flight for the next morning. Not sure why my agent could not find the same flight to Seattle as the others were booked on. She said she could not find anything until the next day? I could have a hotel and a taxi ride to the hotel, but I had to find my own way back from the hotel (20 miles away across the Turnpike!)! I finally had to speak to the supervisor who was able to 'magically' find me a seat on the same flight as the others in my group.

They were multiple groups that weren’t able to get on their flights due to delay at customs yet the airlines did not nothing to help.

The flight attendant said our bags were faster than us but out bags never made it and United dod not put them on the next flight we spent the first 3 days in Peru without our luggage. Our first day was wasted due to having to shop for replacement items and clothing before then flying to Cusco. United said our bags would be at the hotel after having to hike Machu Picchu on a tour scheduled weeks in advanced with clothing bought out outlets. The bags were not at our hotel and we had 15 minutes to get a taxi to the airport before it closes to get our bags before spending another day without. After all that united said they would give us only $200 travel vouchers each that we would receive in 48 hours. It's been over a week and we have not received that and when calling again I got hung up on and the lady was very rude. This was my first experience flying out of the country and this was not a good experience from a airline I frequently fly with for work and being a milage plus member. This showed incompetence and negligence from United and I am not pleased.,-1
2022-10-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,made us check our carryon bags,True,  Absolutely ridiculous. They made us check our carryon bags- upon entering the aircraft there was tons of overhead space. When I asked a crew member why they made us check the bag all he said was “i don't know why she started checking them so early. I told her we had plenty of space and sent her a count”. I’m so done with this airline. I fly them all the time and this happens too often. I’m done! No longer will I fly with this airline.,-1

2022-10-16,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Denver,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,here’s some positive feedback,True,"  Can’t remember when I left a positive review for anyone but these women deserve it. Truly the kindest staff I’ve seen in a decade, all three of the women at the gate 71B at 5am on a Sunday for flight 2376 to Denver were phenomenal, sweet, efficient, accommodating and they offered free checked our bags for everyone and did it quickly. They even changed my seat closer to the front of the plane because my layover is only 40 minutes. This experience bumped United up 100 points in my book. In spite of all negativity in this world, here’s some positive feedback!",1
2022-10-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Eureka to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,isn’t the first issue but the most confusing,False," Booked flight through the United website. After checking out I received an error message saying there was a change to my itinerary and I needed to call customer service. Called customer service and the “change” to my itinerary is that they wanted to charge us $200 more for the flight. Went around in circles with them for two hours getting no answers for why there was an increase in the price after I booked, or why the prices on the website are not accurate. The price on the website is still the same as when I originally booked the flight. Asked the customer service agent to go through all the prices of that same trip for the month, since I am flexible on dates and obviously can’t trust the prices listed on the website. They put me on hold on and off, asking me if different dates would work and me telling them that it depended on the cost of those dates, until she finally got back on the phone and said that actually the original flights I booked were the cheapest and that I needed to pay $200 more than it asks on the website to book them. Finally got off the phone without booking the flight after two hours of talking to them. This isn’t the first issue I’ve had with United but definitely the most confusing.",-1
2022-10-16,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paducah to New York via Chicago,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,"Thank you, United, for being exceptional",True," Yesterday afternoon, due to extraneous factors, I missed my flight from Barkley Regional Airport in Paducah, KY to LaGuardia Airport in NYC. I reached out to United through their Help Center. Within an hour, they put me on the only other flight out of Paducah that day. Not only that, but they had the friendliest flight attendants I have ever met. United's customer service was unconventional and unparalleled. Thank you, United, for being exceptional. I made it back to NYC later last night after all, and I am so appreciative.",1
2022-10-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Redwood Coast to Boston via San Francisco,1.0,,3.0,,1.0,2.0,1,it is catastrophically bad,False," United is not even a budget airline and it is catastrophically bad. They canceled my extremely expensive flight with no notice at all, and rescheduled for me for 24 hours of transit hell. They do not offer any hotel or transportation voucher for weather related cancellations. Gate agents are nice and quick to admit how poorly the airline is run, and how terribly the company takes advantage of people. Really uncomfortable seats. They made the economy group check our carry on bags literally right before we got on the plane, but then we got on the plane and saw there was actually plenty of room in the luggage space. The agent I called when my flight was canceled told me to speak to a gate agent for a hotel voucher, but the gate agent said that can only be done on the phone. So clearly they are poorly trained with little communication between departments. I now have a personal grudge against United and will be warning all friends before they travel.",-1
2022-10-14,0.6,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to State College via Newark,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,4,quite impressed with the seat,True," The pre-flight experience was actually not satisfying. United changed my schedule for the return flight several times and finally gave me a connection with a long layover. At Frankfurt Airport there was a very long line at the United check-in counter - it took a long line until I was able to check in. The inflight experience, though, was much better. I was, in fact, quite impressed with the seat comfort in Premium Economy: the seat was wide, had a lot of legroom and was softer than on the Lufthansa return flight. The inflight entertainment was excellent and United provided high-quality headsets. The food, on the other hand, could have been better - the pasta was bland and the roll cold and hard. In this respect, I could not notice a difference as compared to regular Economy, which I found a bit disappointing. The service from the crew members was efficient and polite enough but they rushed through the cabin section as if they wanted to get their job done as quickly as possible. Overall, the flight was comfortable. Even if the rate was not cheap I did not regret having spent the money for a much more comfortable seat and, thus, more relaxing overall experience.",1

2022-10-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Athens,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,United is literally washing their hands of this issue,True," I have been a member of United for more than 10 years and have the United credit card as well. This flight was $2300, so not cheap. My return flight to SFO was originally scheduled on 7/27/2002, but due to strikes in Germany by Lufthansa covering the Athens-Frankfurt trip (UA 9312), I ended up being stranded with my daughter near Athens airport for 3 days. When going to the counter at airport to rebook one day before, it took me 7 hours on 7/26/2002 at the Lufthansa airport counter to get a new ticket. Lufthansa gave us a voucher for a hotel 30 min away from the city, with nothing to do around. Return trip was a complete nightmare. First at check-in, after 1.5 hours to get to check-in attendant, I am told I cannot check in my luggage until my final destination and that when they rebooked my ticket, they made a mistake and put my daughter as an infant instead of a teenager. We flew back on three different airlines from different alliances, which led to terminal changes both at CDG and JFK. This gave me no time for getting my luggage which ended up being stuck in France for three days. Under federal law, if an airline cancels a flight I am entitled to a full refund. United took two months to respond to basically deny any kind of compensation, since that law only applies to domestic flight. For my daughters trip, she had a round-trip starting from Athens and she was supposed to return to Athens. After this fiasco, we decided to cancel the return ticket. As of today, months later, we did not get refunded for the return, nor any compensation for the strike either. United is literally washing their hands of this issue and put all the blame on LH. What is the point of an alliance if they relinquish their responsibility to them. They should compensate me and negotiate themselves with LH. Here is the meagre and only email received from United Customer Care Team after working on my case for 2 months. They sure work slowly. Stopping business with this airline: ""I am sorry to hear your flight was cancelled with our Star Alliance partners at Lufthansa due to strikes in Germany. I understand your tickets were purchased with United, however, your Regulatory claim due to law is regarding a flight with our Partners at Lufthansa and our Star Alliance agreement is the operating carrier must handle any regulatory claims. Your claim has been sent to LH to review and respond to you directly.""",-1

The ""flat bed"" isn't flat, can't just raise leg rest without reclining seat, lighting very poor: hard to read by. Meal LHR to SFO was inedible (9/22).Am not a fussy eater, but even I can't manage raw (no exaggeration) eggplant. SFO-AKL left 1.25 hrs late : chaotic boarding & they seemed not to know who'd actually boarded the plane. Before the late departure, they summarily and quite rudely kicked us out of biz class lounge at SFO. So, nearly 2hours crammed in unventilated area at SFO waiting to board, standing in line w no info. Food decent on this leg but Plane arrived 1.5 hrs late so I missed domestic NZ connection, having to wait 8 hrs for the next one. Many people in similar situation : United offered no help at all. To add insult to injury, they charge for on-board wifi : dont know of other airlines that do that in biz class. To summarize: no class, uncomfortable and unhelpful.",-1

We flew business class. 45 minutes at the ticket counter to check in. Lost luggage that took 5 days to return and the airline did not return it, my vacation resort sent someone to the airport the retrieve it. Hours online with Customer Service with the airline, promises of callbacks, never followed up or called back. As far as this airline knows, my issues are still unresolved and they do not care.

When we got to Newark NJ we missed our flight by 2 minutes because the plane left 2 minutes early which we were not informed about and then we asked to get in the soonest flight back home and it was all the way in the morning but since the delay problem was “uncontrollable”. They would not even give us a hotel or money for anything! The only reason I took a flight was to make it to my exam at 8 am which of course I missed and they did  nothing about it.

Both flights were on time with very minor delays on departures. The seating in premium economy is spacious and comfortable with ample leg room. Service was typical domestic airline service (complimentary soft drinks and biscoff/nuts) with other snacks available for purchase. The private screening WiFi service worked very well.

I was not allowed to tell my mother where I was because they would not let me go back into business class. My mother was in a panic because she could not find me. Since I was downgraded at the last minute, the plane was about to take off. Finally a fight attendant figured out what happen and told my mother. She was still very upset throughout the flight. I understand that downgrades happen, but the way it was handled was horrible. To top it off I was only offered a worthless coupon to be compensated for the difference in seat price.",-1

I was so frustrated to deal with the wechat access and code issue, until the flight took off, you can imagine how stressful I was at that time. When I came to the counter to explain the customer service to cancel the current flight and have to deal with re-schedule the flight, I felt so thankful to have Brittany Toliver being very patient and kind to search new fight for us, then also ask Monica Huie together to help me find the next available flight and also keep the business class as I had after considering my health issue.

2022-10-01,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Los Angeles,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,1,should value and take CUSTOMER SERVICE seriously,True," Vancouver to Los Angeles. I just wanted to share our family experience with United Airways Ground Service Attendants. I booked our ticket on AMERICAN EXPRESS travel page, we got a confirmed flight for AIR CANADA via UNITED AIRLINES. And it was NOT a PLEASANT one! I have been and still is working in Customer service ALL my 20+ years. And in all of those years working with 2 different big companies I was trained the VALUE of CUSTOMER SERVICE. To which SAD to say my family DID NOT get from the 3 ladies at the gate counter that were assigned on duty on September 30, 2022, 04:55 pm, Flight UA1756 at gate E77 YVR-LAX. I am fully aware that system will randomly assigned the seat according to the availability. But, is it not when you are flying with minors especially when they are under the age of 10, Airline System must prioritize the family to be seated together during the flight? Just like what they advertised on their website? Well, It SURELY DID NOT happen to my family, as all 4 of us are seated on 4 DIFFERENT ROWS!! Is it not the reason Airlines have personnel working behind their computer to make sure that when an issue such as this arises they are there to fix it?? (Could it be their tactics to force you to pay extra money?) I have asked in multiple occasions the United Airlines personnel behind the computer to kindly seat us family together or at least myself and my 2 kids, as it will be hard for the kids, myself, as well as the one who will be seating beside them. Unfortunately, the 3 ladies kept brushing off my concern, so I have asked to speak with the supervisor but I was told that there was no supervisor on duty as it was the last flight? So then I asked for the one in-charge on that shift but she repeatedly told me ""that My family are on economy seats and they CAN NOT do anything and that I should have paid for a preferred seats!"". I have got no complain whatsoever to be seated anywhere on the plane, not even requesting a front or more leg room seat, I was just SIMPLY asking to be seated with my 2 young children. But all 3 of them kept saying that the flight is full, if I want I can just ask the other passenger to switch seats with me?? Here's what FRUSTRATES me about the CUSTOMER SERVICE of their personnel, in situation like this, WHY do I have to look after myself/my family we paid money too to be on the flight? Is it not their job to assist us? Also, why would they have their staff be on the floor, wear their Company ID's but not be allowed to show it? Since when in customer service industry, a PERSONNEL IS NOT ALLOWED to provide their name? (Calling out HR and management, is this how you trained your people?) Anyways, upon boarding, while looking for our assigned seats, my husband approached one of the flight attendant if there's anyway she could help us with the seats, as we were seated separately (too bad I can't address my family's sincere appreciation to HER as I'm told that getting their name is ""AGAINST company's policy"" as per the agent on the ground). SHE gladly assisted us and was able to seat myself with my son who's 5 and my daughter who's 8 with my husband. Again, shout out to her as she definitely turned the bad experience into a good one! TO THE 3 ladies on the counter most especially to the one who I dealt with, I sincerely wish that she gets some PROPER COACHING from their management. That should value and take CUSTOMER SERVICE seriously as this is their means of income!",-1

Inside there was a huge queue of passengers who wanted to ask for information on what time the plane would leave, only one person was attending the counter. The flight was canceled but the United employees never told us that, they never gave an official announcement. When I was finally able to talk to the person at the counter, he said that we would have to take other flights. He sent us on a late flight to Seattle and we had to sleep there without luggage, I asked him to take down the luggage from the canceled flight and he said it was impossible. Arriving in Seattle at the counter, ask for a hotel explaining the situation, for which we were taken to a truly horrible hotel called Quality Inn. In the morning we fly to Denver and finally to El Paso. It was terrible, we arrived almost twenty four hours after the original arrival. Our bags arrived three days later in El Paso. It was a very unpleasant experience, with their attitude United staff seem to not care much about the customer. I will never fly with this airline again, I already investigated and there are many very unpleasant stories that happen frequently.",-1

One for myself, and one for my son. I asked the United agent to use any of our available flight credits towards the two tickets and I would pay the difference. When they sent me a confirmation email, I noticed only my name--so I called United. They confirmed that I had two tickets and sent me a confirmation email listing both myself and my son as passengers. On the day of travel we checked in at the baggage check area and got our boarding passes which included seat assignments. When we tried to get on the plane, I was told my son did not actually have a ticket. We were flying a red eye and needed to get back east for a funeral. United told me I would have to purchase a ticket or we would not make the funeral. They also charged me 20% more for the ticket. I called customer service and explained what happened the next day and they said to submit a refund request and United, ""would make it right."" United Customer Care rejected my request in less than a day.",-1
2022-09-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Colorado Springs,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,most horrible flight experience,True,"  I am reviewing this United/SkyWest flight because it was the most horrible flight experience we have ever had. It started by having the gate change 3 times necessitating walks to the next gate (over a 10 min. walk ea.) We are mobility impaired with no shuttle around. While waiting on the second change we observed the same type of jet (CRJ200) going to Aspen fully boarded waiting with a failure to start #2 Engine for over 1 hr. This is a real confidence builder! They finally gave us a new gate over 10 min. walk and of course there was a departure delay. When we boarded it was extremely hor as the A/C wasn't working properly. They assured it would be ok when we got airborne in 10 min. over 25 min we weren't rolling and it was getting worse! Finally we were in the air the A/C still wasn't working properly. Very hot and uncomfortable trip. Needless to say this will be the last trip on united from COS to and from DEN we will be taking as the road shuttle service will be cheaper, faster and more comfortable. United was a complete Failure.",-1
2022-09-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Jacksonville,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United Airlines is terrible,False,"  United Airlines is terrible. I volunteered to change my flight due to Hurricane Ian. I did it preemptively, and United showed me the change happens at no cost, including an upgrade to first class. Their system was ""broken"", and I was allowed to nearly confirm my ticket with the upgrade. Everything showed me I was good until the very end where it said I had to call their customer service. Turns out, after more than an hour on hold, I had to pay for the the upgrade. It may not sound like a big deal, but the fact that I'm paying for another night at a hotel + moving my schedule around, under the premise that as a courtesy I'd get a complimentary upgrade, was what made this move okay in my mind. I'm less annoyed by the lack of an upgrade and more that they're team is inept. Their customer service isn't service. If you have a choice, do not fly United. At least you know what you're getting with Spirit. PS This is after being grounded on the tarmac before a flight due to a ""loose screw"" in one of the wings.",-1

The Crew messed up the baggage number which resulting my baggage ended up in Oregon instead in San Francisco. United Airlines was very slow in responding the problem they created at the first place and didn't send my baggage to its destination after a few days. Take note: they wont compensate you for their own mistake so I will file a complain in DOT. Horrible experience. I would not recommend anyone to fly United Airlines.,-1

United board the plane in groups, but no one was checking as you boarded. Cabin baggage limits were not checked, although announcements were made. All the customers that had more carry-on than they were allowed, boarded as soon as they wanted and took up all the available cabin storage. Personal items that are meant to be stowed under the seat were in the overhead bins and when pointed out to cabin crew they basically said their was nothing they could do, and they did nothing. Travelled 15hrs with mine at my feet. Seats are atrocious, skinny, thin and hard, cut off the circulation in your legs within an hour. The 2 middle seats (centre row of four) must have been designed by a ""muppet"" that will never sit in them. The mounting for the seats in front is right where your foot goes, severely limiting leg/foot room, worst still it angles back towards you. Cabin staff not friendly and certainly not helpful.

To say that this airline is awful is an understatement. My wife and I planned our honeymoon to Croatia using credit card points through AMEX and based on the points and the destination, we were advised to use United. The first problem with the airline is bin space and baggage allowance. Our first destination was to Washington DC from Houston and my wife had a bag that had many of her necessary needs for our International flight and due to inconsistencies they told her that she would not be able to bring her bag on the flight and that it needed to be checked since bin space was limited (we saw people place take three personal bags onto the plane and place into the bins above). When asked if she would see her bag in DC they told her no and that she would only see it when we landed in Croatia. We had 2 destinations (DC and Zurich) that we would be landing at before then which was a total time frame of around 16 hours. Due to this my wife was unable to keep many of her things that she needed for the long flight. They allowed no wiggle room despite bins having space when we entered the plane nor did they provide us with advice, just kept telling us it would be seen in Croatia. Next issue was after we landed in DC and made it to our gate to Zurich, I walked up to the front desk (since we were on our honeymoon) to ask if there were any upgrades available. The very rude lady at the desk laughed in my face causing others to look at me and told me that ""We haven't done that since the 70's and even if we did, everyone would be on their honeymoon! It's a full flight and you can go sit down now"" She never looked at her computer nor did she apologize for nothing being available. Lastly on our 9 hour flight from DC to Zurich, being in the premium economy class, the TVs did not even work on the flight and we were told to watch from our devices and we were never given a choice for a dinner meal (the vegetarian meal) because they ran out of the meat meal and were never offered an apology or even given something extra to make up for the deficiency. This Airline clearly is just taking advantage of people during a flight/travel crisis and they could not give a care in the world about correcting their deficiencies. Good luck if you ever fly this airline.",-1
2022-09-24,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1,This is going to be a brutal flight,False,"  Air travel is usually not a pleasant experience, but after several rough goes with United in the past, what is happening as I type is beyond. The lady next to me refuses to move her leg out of my space, and the guy in front of me repeatedly and forcefully reclined his seat over again as soon as he felt it hit my knee. I tried to be polite, they were awful. I then asked flight attendants for assistance, to which they shrugged and said there's nothing they can do. I'm stuck in a tiny ball in the window seat with arthritis in my back. This is going to be a brutal flight. They were already subpar by my standards, but they were the only option. If they're the only option in the future, I think I'll just pass. I'm being ripped off to have my back problems exacerbated because no one wants to even attempt to help. If I could leave zero stars for the cabin crew, I would. They have tiny seat space compared to Jet Blue, Delta, and American. The cabin is also absolutely sweltering.",-1
2022-09-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to London,2.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Don't use them,True,"  As long everything is smooth its good airline, but if any small bump, like delay, cancelation, mistake in charge etc, they are the worst. No one to talk to, even when at the end you do reach some one they push you of, no refund, no service. you can be stuck in middle of no where because you dont have who to talk. Don't use them. Better take airline that a bit less comfortable but you know that if anything wrong they will help you!",-1
2022-09-23,0.8,Family Leisure,Business Class,New York to Los Angeles,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4,Staff are good and accommodating,True,"  This is one of a few United flights out of JFK, meaning there is no United Club. We got access to the Alaska Lounge instead, and it was just as underwhelming as the old United Club. Terminal 7 at JFK is small and old, so there is nothing to roam around. On board, the seats are comfortable flatbed seats but without direct aisle access for window passenger. Since we travelled as family, that was not an issue. Also, for a domestic flight, the seat is quite generous. Staff are good and accommodating. However, the food is mediocre, and menu choices are exactly the same as what we got on our United flights back in January. I am not sure how frequent United rotates their menu. The flight departed and arrived relatively on time, so that is quite good providing all the issues we heard about airports.",1
2022-09-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Pensacola,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,,1.0,1,additional connection into our itinerary,False," Spokane to Pensacola. A couple months after we (7 family members) booked our flights to Pensacola, the airline pushed an additional connection into our itinerary. We had paid a higher price when booking just to avoid having more than one layover, but the airline threw one in anyway. We had a one-time chance to cancel or reschedule on our own if we didn't like the change. However, when we looked at the current flight schedules and prices, they were of course for a lot more money now. It took us two entire days to get to Pensacola because of further plane delays and complete flight cancellations on almost all of the flights. Lack of customer service at the airport caused further nightmares. We prepaid for all our checked luggage for going on our trip and coming back, however, it took an assistant at each airport to key in secret codes while getting boarding passes because the prepaid amounts did not show in their system. We had to pull up copies of our emails showing our prepayment, because the airline did not have records. While on the planes, the stewardesses and pilots were always very nice and helpful. This shows where the majority of trouble lies with the airline. Their booking system and airport staff.",-1
2022-09-22,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bozeman to San Francisco,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,4,Great service today,False,  Great service today from the Boise cabin crew members on the flight from BZN to SFO. Friendly and worked well. Did a great job keeping the cabin serviced.,1
2022-09-21,1.0,Couple Leisure,First Class,Jackson to Indinapolis via Denver,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,4,We were actually very pleased,False,"  We recently flew from Indy to Jackson Wyoming and back with layovers in Denver. 4 flights in all. With all the news lately about short staff and cancelled flights we were very worried leading up to this vacation. We were actually very pleased. Plenty of help at ticket counter, gate and great flight crew. Special mention for all 4 crews of flight attendants who all worked flawlessly in concert to make sure we had whatever we needed. All flights were on schedule, like planning and organization are actually important to someone besides us. While waiting to board one flight we heard the neighbor's gate offering vouchers for people to take another flight because of overbooking issues. You can probably guess what airline that was. It was like that for the last 30 years and still today. Great job United! We can't quite come up with a suggestion to have made this a better experience.",1
2022-09-20,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Rochester,5.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,improve customer satisfaction and quality,True,  I boarded a United Airline flight from EWR to Rochester. The flight was scheduled to depart at 9:20pm. However we we kept in the plane up till 11:00pm. The cause was due to improper standardization and lack of lean transformation improvements. The resultant effect was a total loss of man hour resources of 50 onboarded passengers. The RCF was due to positioning of a smaller plane side by side with the Bigger plane with no exit plan for the smaller plane which I was on board. I recommend that United airline management considers the deployment of lean transformation strategies to correct the deficiencies in this system and improve customer satisfaction and quality delivery.,1
2022-09-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not fly with them ever again,False,  They overbooked a flight from Munich to San Francisco by 11 people and left behind many of us because they overbooked the flight without warning us. I had been travelling from Italy since 3 am and waited in Munich for 5 hours before they told me I could not board. Of course the next flight for that same day was full so I had to stay the night in Munich. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. I paid 900 $ for this flight (one way) and ended up having a 24 hour delay. I will not fly with them ever again nor recommend it to anyone.,-1
2022-09-17,0.6,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Los Angeles,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2,by far the best check in,True,"  Have to say by far the best check in and boarding my husband and I have  experienced at Sydney airport ground staff. Every staff member was amazing, customer service was awesome, very friendly and helpful. Vik at check counter was very helpful who made us feel ease and very professional. Paula was wonderful at boarding gate and very professional. The service from the staff was faultless, amongst the best I've had. From the time we arrived at check in and at departure gate was just easy. Big thank you to Sydney team!",1

Forced to check carryon for $35! Last time flying with United Airlines. I’d rather walk.  Now flight attendant is late causing a delay.,-1
2022-09-12,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Phoenix,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,customer service was incredible,True,"  United customer service was incredible. We had a flight booked from Athens to Phoenix with Lufthansa, with the last part of the flight, Chicago to Phoenix, being in correspondence with United. Lufthansa had a delay arriving to Chicago, where we had to go through customs, and as a result we lost our last flight to Phoenix. United rebooked our flight with zero charge, offered us a comfort gift of water bottle, tooth brush etc, blankets and a couched area to spend the night, found our lost luggage and changed our seats according to our preference as my fiancee is over 6 ft tall. It doesn't sound like a lot but when you have been traveling in an airplane the whole day and something like losing your last flight happens, offering some comfort really counts, considering it wasn't even their fault.",1
2022-09-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Lexington,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Customer service was incredibly unhelpful,True,"  I thought Spirit was bad, this airline competes. The plane firstly is tiny and not comfortable. They didn’t offer any drinks or snacks and the staff was not exactly friendly. After delaying our return flight, they cancelled “due to weather” although the weather was not bad and our plane was sitting at the gate and they had initially told us they were waiting for the pilot. They offered no compensation and said the soonest they could get us home was in 3 days. A flight left shortly after ours was supposed to, going to the same place yet, somehow, ours was cancelled for “weather”. Customer service was incredibly unhelpful.",-1
2022-09-11,0.9,Solo Leisure,First Class,Tampa to Newark via South Pasadena,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,this flight was comfortable and pleasant,False,"  In the flood of negative reviews about United, it is incumbent on those of us who have good experiences to also comment. I was upgraded to the front cabin from Tampa to Newark. We boarded punctually and in good order; we departed early, and we arrived at the gate 15 minutes ahead of schedule. The breakfast served (scrambled eggs with ham and tomato) was tasty and ample. I was particularly impressed with the enthusiasm and efficiency of the TPA based flight crew. On the return flight to Tampa, I chose the exit-row window seat. The adjacent middle seat remained open, so this flight too was comfortable and pleasant. This plane had seat-back monitors, and the choice of films, programs, and live TV was impressive. I will be flying United again in three weeks, this time transatlantic. I am looking forward to the experience.",1
2022-09-11,0.1,Business,First Class,Washington to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst airline out there,True,"  United Airlines is quite plainly put the worst airline out there - from the perspective of service, trouble shooting if issues arise or just plain professionalism. I actually find Spirit and Frontier superior in terms of quality.",-1
2022-09-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,"Overall, terrible experience.",False,"  Awful I paid for row 7C, with no seat in front of me. They arbitrarily changed me to 21C, a so called exit row, but the second set of seats with no extra leg room. The flight is delayed over an hour. They made me check my carryon. Overall, terrible experience.",-1
2022-09-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Denver to London,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a greatly inferior experience,True, Denver to London. I purchased a business class Polaris cabin ticket with my own compartment. At the last minute United changed planes and the seat was no longer anything close to what I paid a premium for. When contacting the United they absolutely wouldn’t take accountability for the switch. This was nothing less than a bait and switch leaving me out of thousands of dollars. You pay for something and get a greatly inferior experience. Cheating there customers and absolutely refusing to take responsibility. Do you really any to fly an airline with these ethics?,-1
2022-09-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Moab via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,customer service which really doesn't exist,True,"  Phoenix to Moab via Denver. This is the first and hopefully my last trip on United. Our plane left Phoenix, AZ (with no a/c while on tarmac because of missing part that was in Denver, CO) and were to land in Denver at 2.28p.m. and leave for Moab Utah at 1:10. We landed at gate B55 and our connecting flight was to be at B19. When we arrived at B19 I received a text saying the gate had been changed to B94. I am disabled and have a hard time walking but we got one of the guys to give us a ride to the elevator to go downstairs to B94. I had let them know we were on our way and we got there at 1:11 and the plane was still at the gate but they would not allow us to board. They sent us to customer service which really doesn't exist as the people just sit there and tell you there is another flight tomorrow which wouldn't help us as we had a train to catch the next day before their flight left Denver. I called the service that was to pick us up in Moab to cancel and they told me that United had a flight to Grand Junction and that Moab Express would come and get us. That cost us an additional $265 which United is not willing to reimburse but instead gave us a $150 voucher to use by the end of 2023 that I hope not to have to use. I am willing to pay more to fly another carrier than use the voucher. They only give you something to drink and you have to buy a snack. Frontier Airlines and Southwest board the handicapped with the military and people traveling with small children but not United.",-1
2022-09-08,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to San Francisco,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,5.0,4,The best customer service,False,"  The best customer service at the boarding counter and check in counter. These ladies went out of their to help me. I was so happy to receive such a good service by company employees. They made sure I get on plane, they offered wheelchair service. I don’t mind playing because of the service.  United airlines employees are great, God bless them for helping me all the way to my destination.",1
2022-09-07,0.1,Business,Business Class,Munich to New York,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Don't fly United business class,True,"  One of the worse experiences. I have flown on business class for the better part of the last 20 years. I have seen United service from staff to food going down. Today was one of the worse flights I had in years. I flew from Munich so they served 2 meals. The first meal, both of my choices were not available .I ended up with pasta that tasted awful. It came with a small salad and a bun both were old and stale. Wine options were very poor as well. The second meal they had cuscus or a burger. The burger was a frozen one that they warmed in the microwave. When I pointed to the staff they shrugged there shoulders and stated that is what they got. United business will be from now on my last choice. I flew Lufthansa the week before to Frankfurt and it was completely different. Don't fly United business class! Not worth the money, look for the Europeans or the middle eastern companies. Much better.",-1
2022-09-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orange County to San Francisco,,,,,,2.0,1,i will never fly them again,True,"  I got a ticket for my wife with united airline on Aug-4 -2022 to go from orange county to San Francisco, this was fine. got a retune ticket on Aug-27-2022 to come to OC from San Francisco, for $175.60. after I booked, they asked for $50.00 extra for carryon, and another $30-$50 if I wanted to select a seat. This is highway rubbery, to book a flight then hit you with more fees. I cancelled the airline within 50 minutes. Then I booked the same flight for $170.00 with Alaska Airline, which included the carryon as well as seat selection. no other fees added after booking. After 40 years of flying United Airline for business and please. i will never fly them again.",-1
2022-09-05,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Midland,2.0,,1.0,,,3.0,3,not an airline that values customers,True,  United is not an airline that values customers. The last time I flew with United in April 2022 they changed seats on me after I boarded the airplane. A person came to me saying it was their seat and I had just double checked the seat number. My lap child was asleep in my arms already sitting down with my stuff put away the gate agent boarded and very rudely demanded I move seats to the new one which was 20 rows back in a middle seat mind you sleeping toddler in my arms. I asked the lady if she would take my new seat she kindly did but when she got to my new seat it was also taken. The rudeness and pure lack of humanity I will never forget. Fast forward to today I decided to give them another chance and yet again rude attendants and lack of compassion. If you are flying with small children I’d recommend any other airline.,-1
2022-09-03,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Rome,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,switches your seats without telling you,False,"  Horrible. This airline switches your seats without telling you. My wife and I selected seats next to one another months in advance. Only to find as we board the plane, that our seats were switched. They do not take responsibility and simply ask you to defer to the other passengers. This was a 10 hour flight. The airline needs to give a courtesy notice via email when seats are changed. If we had know in advance, we could have went to the checkout counter in order to find a solution. Very poor service and expensive.",-1
2022-09-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,customer service is awful,False,"  I am a traveling person, usually fly 6-7 times per year for vacation (usually fly Delta) I usually avoid certain airlines, but had no choice on my Cancun trip. This airline is all about the money and don't care about the people who fly on the plane. The customer service is awful. After a horrible start to the trip the flight took off the flight was relatively full with the exception of a few rows that was empty and a few with only one passenger. A passenger who was a little large in size and sitting in the middle of a row got up and occupied on of the available empty seats. Well let me tell you the flight attendant was so mean and loud she asked him to get up and return to his seat if he did not he would have to pay $140 extra to sit in that seat. That plane flew to Cancun with those empty seats. I thought this world can be so cruel and mean people and businesses only pretend to care about people. I would never fly with this airline again never.",-1

I paid an extra $600 the day of my flight to be upgraded to a first class seat. Our initial plan was delayed and we missed the connecting flight so I sat/slept in the Denver airport all night and wasted my $600 first class seat. I requested a refund and have been asked to submit it again. I've now submitted it 3 times! That is very low...crooks! Use a different airline.,-1
2022-09-01,0.2,Couple Leisure,First Class,Vancouver to Omaha,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,United First class is not worth it,True,"  United First class is not worth it. We flew Vancouver to Denver en route to Omaha. Our Denver flight was delayed 3 hours due to “mechanical issues”. We tried to go to the United lounge but were denied because we “were not flying internationally”. Canada is not international? We are first-class ticket holders and you, United, have a 3-hour delay? The staff of the lounge was very courteous but “this is United policy”. dumb. When we did get on the flight, at 11 p,m., food service consisted of a 6-oz bottle of water, a packaged cookie and a small package of crackers. Attendants were cranky and unresponsive. I get that they were tired too, but it was certainly no fault of the passengers. Again, United first class isn’t justified. We had recently flown Air Canada and Air Alaska business class, both of which were great—friendly staff, nice food. Bye, United.",-1

First flight cancelled ... no compensation, put onto connecting flight instead of direct flight as originally booked. Not enough time was allocated for layover resulting in missed connection and spending more money on overnight hotels. Rebooked for following day and sat on tarmac for 3 hours. Final flight home and I'm currently sat in airport after boarding and unboarding after some system failures. We're now 3 hours delayed for getting home. Customer service is shocking and how a company can stuff up on so many occasions in one trip baffles me. Will never book with them again!",-1

One of the flight attendants and a baggage clerk were dreadful - rude, obnoxious, tons of attitude. Another review mentions United has really deteriorated over the last few months, and that is exactly what I have experienced. I'm done with them.

2022-08-30,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Denver,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,3,forced to check in carry-on luggage,True,"  I traveled from Albuquerque to Denver in United with carry-on luggage, and had a follow up flight from Denver to Kansas City in Frontier. The United gate attendant in Albuquerque forced all group 4 and 5 passengers to check in their carry-on luggage to be picked up at the out of security zone luggage area in Denver. I explained to him that I needed my carry-on luggage on board as I my next flight was in Frontier and I would not have time to go to the luggage area, and go through security in Denver, otherwise I would miss my Frontier flight. My request was ignored and a luggage tag was placed on my carry-on item and was instructed to leave the carry-on item at the boarding gate by the plane. Upon boarding the plane I spoke with the flight attendant about my concern that I would miss my connecting flight in Frontier, and she said there is still plenty of space for carry-on luggage and that I could just put my tagged luggage in any overhead bin, which I did. I was also told to return the luggage tag to the gate attendant in Denver so they could account for the luggage in the system.",-1
2022-08-30,0.1,Business,First Class,Norfolk to Washington,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,Employees try their hardest to avoid helping,True,"  Employees try their hardest to avoid helping. The self check-in/baggage drop process is chaotic. I stood in line for almost an hour because almost everyone at the kiosks we’re having issues and the two employees who were working were avoiding eye contact with anyone who tried to ask for help and walking around slowly like they had nothing to do. When I got to the kiosk to check my bag, the machine had a difficult time reading my ticket. By the time it read my ticket, I got a screen saying that I had to check my bag in 45 minutes before departure. My flight departed at 6:00am and it was exactly 5:15am. When I asked the agent about it she shrugged and said you gotta take it with you. I told her that I had liquids in my bag and she told me to throw them away. When another associate got involved, he just waved his finger for me to leave. I booked a first class seat to be able to experience decent service and a free checked bag and all I received were two rude and lazy associates who did their best to accomplish as little as possible. I had to throw out over $100 worth of my facial regimen and personal care liquids. I would have been a little more understanding if the associates acted with compassion but they acted with no class and a lot of unwarranted attitude. Will go out of my way to avoid United from now on.",-1

The flights and flight attendants were fine but the airlines did not have enough food on the flight from from Paris to Washington. They had only Turkey sandwiches. Choice of cranberry juice or sprite. No apple/orange juice. There were a number of people who were vegan or vegetarian on the flight that did not eat anything. The flight attendants mentioned that they only had 10 non-turkey sandwiches which is kind of surprising in this day and age.,-1

2022-08-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lehigh to Milwaukee,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Very disappointed,False,  Well we started with being told we were flying first to Newark NJ which turned out to be a packed full small bus and not a plane. I complained and they told me they could put me on a plane to Chicago then to MKE for a $250 change fee and a $200 up charge per passenger which was $900 more then the already $1200 spent on the trip. Then I asked if there was an upgrade available even at a discount which she said they could upgrade us for $298 per seat which was double the upgrade to first class on the app. I was very upset. We finally made it to Newark. We went to the gate to be told they don’t have a pilot and that they hope that they will have one soon. After an hour delay the pilot showed up and we were on our way. Kudos to the gate agent because he allowed my elderly mother to board the plane first because there were not enough seats in the terminal for her to sit so she stood the whole time. Then to find out there are no plugs for our devices like advertised on the website. (We we’re in premium economy. ) I have flown United for over a million miles between personal and business and never had an experience like this. I will fly American or delta from now on. Very disappointed.,-1

I tried contacting them for a month and a half for a reimbursement for my lost/delayed luggage and still haven’t gotten any response back. They first decide it’s okay to send over my luggage 10 days after I’ve finished my vacation! I went a whole 10 days without any of my belongings. They decided to send over my luggage to the country I left. They did not send an email or call that they were going to hold my luggage for no reason!  I finally got contact with Canada to see if they could send my luggage back home to where I was. It took nearly 2 months to get my bag back home and my luggage came broken.,-1

Cancelled flight, rescheduled on a flight that would not work. I had to reschedule myself. And then had to pay a penalty for changing my reservation! No communication! Terrible service in every area. The food was cold and terrible. We got breakfast with a side of bad attitude. The flight attendants are rude, don't give a damn! I paid for a premium upgrade, my headphones didn't work so I spent 10+ hours playing games on my phone. Disgraceful.",-1
2022-08-26,1.0,Business,Business Class,Berlin to Orlando via Newark,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5,Great customer service all around,False,"  I traveled on United Flight 1105 on 8/22/22. We had a significant delay, total of 6 hours. We were sitting on the field and weren't able to take off due to bad storms. The flight crew was amazing! Cabin crew very friendly and attentive and captain updated us constantly on the status, even came out at some points and talked to us directly face to face. I felt they made every effort to get us of the ground given the circumstances. Further, I didn't realize upon arrival that my luggage was badly damaged, as we arrived at 2am and I had traveled at this pint for almost 24 hours. I file a report two days later and was given the option of choosing a new piece of luggage within 24 hours. Great customer service all around.",1

Everyone boards in groups 1 or 2, the attendants don’t care about your needs or happiness. With gold status rarely am I eligible For an upgrade and most recently with group 1 status, I still am unable to get an overhead above my seat! They don’t care, don’t want to follow rules unless it benefits them. For a free for all, I’d rather pay 1-2 and use Frontier - at least they care.

With very little hope, my husband approached the desk attendant, My, and asked if we could get on an earlier flight, My was so courteous and helpful.

Making the story short, we booked a flight from ATL to KIV flew out in July and are to return September 7th. United notified us that they need to change our flight because they are some miss-connected flights. Well, we have a flexible time to check for flights up to September 15 all they were able to tell me is they can’t accommodate 5 passengers and are unable to fined any flight for us.",-1

If the tell you there is an unexpected delay because of the weather 9 out 10 times they are lying. They know full well that the weather is going to be bad, connections will be missed and passengers will get stuck at airports for days! Yet, they deliberately choose to fly anyway (its their policy and i think they keep their pilots in the dark to allow for deniability). Reason being if they cancel a flight, they are liable. This behavior deliberately endanger the wellbeing of their passengers and crew.",-1

I have never experienced this in the airlines even the smallest airlines help their passengers when there’s a delay, but United Airlines is a heartless people. I had to sleep on the floor last night hungry with no food and water because we got diverted from Phoenix to ORF airport. At first, the pilot said that there was a severe thunderstorm and we needed to stay a little bit inside the aircraft to clear it; second, the pilot said he needed to put gas in the plane, and lastly, he said he could not fly because its 9hrs total of hours already and that's due to severe thunderstorm happening in the east coast. They have been saying this severe thunderstorm issue because they don’t want to provide anything for the passengers and even compensate us for the delayed service. I have to pay extra on the parking lot today for $38, and I called out to my work also. United Airlines doesn’t care about their passengers; they just need your money.",-1

Now they have to wait more than 6 hours to get another connection and they have to make another stop in Munich before they even get to Romania.  UA could have communicated this delay to at least show up 6 hours later at Newark airport. My parents are elderly, they have medical issues and this is very unsafe for them. United Airlines cancelled the original flight that my parents booked back in June. Then they offered them this alternative with 5 hours of waiting in Frankfurt, which my parents had no choice but to accept. They didn't answer the calls placed numerous times and the waiting period was almost 2 hours each time with no real person interaction but disconnected in the end. Treating people like this is unacceptable! My parents should be reimbursed for this flight.",-1
2022-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Munich,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,"disrespectful, unprofessional, and useless",True," Newark to Munich. I’ll do my best not to fly with United ever again. This airline is a catastrophe! The staff are shockingly disrespectful, unprofessional, and useless, taking pleasure in having ‘power’ over the passengers who are supposed to shut up and follow every absurd order without hesitation. They made me feel like a convict rather than a customer who paid for their services. My daughter and I made the mistake of flying with United from Newark, NJ, to Munich. It was a disaster right from the start. During online check-in I realized that you couldn’t choose your seat. My daughter and I were conveniently assigned two seats in the middle of a 4-seat row. The only way to get out was to pay extra, and not too little. This is pure blackmail! I already paid heftily for our tickets and simply couldn’t afford to pay more. Nor did I expect to. I guess I'm spoiled. Problems and tension continued on the ground. When we were checking in our bags, a United employee in charge couldn’t answer a single question we had and just grumpily pointed her finger at the check-in kiosk. It appeared that she couldn’t speak English at all and had no clue about the check-in process. Boarding was performed in the ‘Meet the Parents’ style, with group numbers and very strict rules on who goes where, how and when. When our group was finally called, the passengers were told to form 2 lines. One of them was going faster and I had the audacity to switch to it. That was a huge offense to the supervising employee (who actually did nothing at all before he noticed me and didn’t care that there were 4 people in one line and 40 in the other one). He forced me back into the initial line and, to teach me a lesson, invited 5-7 people ahead of me to switch to the shorter line. I asked him if this was really necessary because I ended up ahead of them thanks to his ‘lesson’. He just snarled at me and withdrew with a job-well-done air. Right before the airplane door, they suddenly forced us to check in our carry-ons (that United allows on international flights), claiming that there was no more room on the plane. I told them that our bags were quite small and that we had a very tight connection in Munich. Should our carry-ons be lost, we’d have no basic stuff to survive for a couple of days. But that didn’t convince them. What’s worse, they didn’t give us any time to remove our valuables from the carry-ons. We had to decide within seconds, on the floor right in front of the plane door and under unkind supervision of boarding personnel. As I was franticly going through my carry-on to salvage my computer, an employee yelled at me ‘You wanna fly? Gimme that bag!’ Some service. Our carry-ons did make it to Munich. However, ALL of my underwear (used and new) was missing from mine. This is the craziest thing I have ever experienced! And I have no illusions about reimbursement. If I could give negative points to United, I would. After reading other reviews, I actually consider myself lucky and feel very sorry for everybody who had to go through this hell.",-1
2022-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cabo to Cincinnati via Houston,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,Service was sub-par,False,"  If I could give no stars, I would. It’s not an option. It should be. So, the wife and I took an amazing week long vacation to Cabo. Our airline of choice for the trip was American Airlines. We got to Cabo with no problems, on time and had excellent service from American. The vacation was awesome. Everything was great with our trip until we got to the airport for our return trip home. Due to weather, we could fly American from Cabo to Dallas/Fort Worth but would have to stay the night because our return flight to Cincinnati was cancelled. The ticket agent said we could fly out on an earlier United Airlines flight to Houston, have a longer lay over and get home later than planned, but we would get home by midnight. We decided to go with United. Big mistake. Initially when we checked in for American, we pre-paid our checked bags. American wasn’t set up to refund our pre-paid checked bags, we were flying another airline, so I get having to pay for checked bags again for United, but it still peeved my off. Although we had boarding passes printed by American, we were directed to the automated kiosk to check in for United. We did. Then we went to the counter. They did the same thing we did in the automated kiosk. Exactly the same things. This slowed us up and we had to rush to make the flight. We made it in the nick of time to  United Airlines counter staff. The flight to Houston was notable in the fact the we sat in the very last row of the plan and had listen to the cabin crew gripe about the flight crew and United Airlines in general. Service was sub-par. That’s the reason I hate to fly United, no one is happy that works for them. No one. Upon arrival to Houston, we found that a corner of my wife’s check on bag was broken off and a wheel was missing. The baggage person didn’t care and said we could not do anything about it there and would have to file a claim at our final destination. Once we cleared the baggage check we found out our flight to Cincinnati had been canceled. Figuring we were going have to overnight in Houston we tried to retrieve our bags but were told that we could get them there. Linearly, the bags at this point were right past the entrance to the conveyer belt. We were told we would have to wait to get our bags until our cancelled flights departure time and even then, it would take a while. We were then directed to out departure gate tof our cancelled flight. The staff at the gate stated the flight had been cancelled due to staffing, gave us a QR code to rebook a flight home or go to customer service for help. We walked to the United Airlines customer service area and joined the 400 people already in-line waiting. While waiting 4-plus hours in the line I called the customer service line on the QR code and found I could fly out of Houston, to Cincinnati, 24-hours later or fly to Louisville tonight. Louisville is an hour and a half drive from Cincinnati and we had no way to get to Cincinnati from Louisville. Apparently no “weather” issues to Louisville but to Cincinnati “weather” issues. We rebooked our flight 24-hours later and were told to go to customer serviced for boarding passes and vouchers for hotel rooms in Houston. After waiting for four hours in a line for customer service we were told that the cancellation was weather related not staffing and as such, United was not responsible for providing food vouchers or hotel vouchers.",-1

They upgraded me from economy to economy plus, I don't know why, I didn't ask them to, but I appreciated the extra space. Both flights departed and landed not only on time but a few minutes early. Good service and comfortable seat. I didn't check luggage. This experience would not have been remarkable pre pandemic but now seems little short of miraculous. Thank you United!",1

They are not going to provide bassinet (smaller aircraft), not allow me to bring my bassinet, not willing to get me a seat where I can get enough leg room to carry my baby on my lap. They just want your money and asking to pay for every minor thing. What a money grab airline! Do not recommend this airline.

2022-08-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Kelowna to Chicago via Vancouver,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2,I've never been so mad at an airline,True,"  On my way from Chicago to Canada, my bag never left Chicago. It was a pain in the butt to try to get my bag back the next day, but because they knew where it was, it was able to be done. Everyone I talked to both on the United and Air Canada side could not give me any information along the way and it was never scanned or documented. But at the end of the day I got my bag back. Now on the way back, I had a connecting flight in Vancouver, and there was a plane delay. That happens all the time - I travel for work so I'm constantly on planes, and the delays do not bother me. This delay however caused me to miss my connection, so I had to be rebooked from Vancouver to Chicago with another connecting flight through Denver. I triple asked and was reassured that my bag would follow me to Chicago and that they would reroute it. I was not allowed to pass customs until my bag was confirmed in Vancouver, so I know it at least made it to Vancouver. When I got to Chicago (at 2:00 a.m. the next day instead of the 8:00 p.m. the previous day as I was expecting), it was clear that my bag could not made it with me. I submitted a file reference number, and was told my bag would get to me either tomorrow or the next day. The things in my bag are for work, so I need them to do my job and I am at a major disadvantage not having them. Since then, I called on Saturday as well as multiple times on Sunday and now it is Monday and I've called three or four times today as well. I almost never leave reviews and I almost never call as much as I have, but my confidence in their ability to get my bag back as extremely low. Every single person I've talked to (And I've talked to people in both United and Air Canada) has first said that they don't know where the bag is and then after I insist that it made it to Vancouver, they put me on a hold and then come back and confirm that it is definitely in Vancouver and they just need to have it released by Air Canada. Everyone I've talked to has been very polite, but nothing has really been helpful in getting my bag back. They've said that they need to contact Air Canada to get them to release the bag to send to Chicago. I have now been told this four times. Two of those four times they put me on a hold to contact Vancouver and then came back maybe 3 minutes later to say they couldn't get a hold of anyone so they'll message them to release the bag. The only flight to Chicago leaving Vancouver is in 2 hours from now and I'm not very confident that my bag will make it on that flight which means I'm going to be SOL for work tomorrow. My bag is literally just sitting there in Vancouver and no one can seem to figure out how to get it on a plane. It's located, we know where it is, we know how to get it back to me, but it's just not happening. I recognize that United is trying to get back on their feet after the craziness of the last few years and they have limited staff. And I totally emphasize with that. On the other hand, it should be an easy interaction to figure this out and it wouldn't take very long. No one can seem to explain to me why it's an issue to take 3 days to get Air Canada to release the bag (And I'm not even very confident that that is the issue, since after talking to Air Canada that doesn't seem to be the problem) to send to Chicago, and still no end in sight. At this point I'm considering my bag a goner, and just hopeful that I have enough time to replace everything. I've never been so mad at an airline.",-1

After 2 hours of waiting at the gate we were told our flight was cancelled all because a spot of rain on the Denver runway. Then whilst waiting to rebook in the waiting lounge we saw the same destination being flown to despite ""the rain"" that apparently caused our flight to be cancelled.

2022-08-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Chicago,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,We will never fly United again,True,"  The complete and utter lack of customer service your company displayed yesterday was the absolute worst thing I’ve ever encountered in my life. My husband and I were traveling with a 10 month old and a 4 year old to see my grandmother for what could be the last time our entire family will ever all be together. Our original flight from MCO to IAH was changed and we were rerouted to O’Hare. You changed our flights, had us arriving to O’Hare at 12:33, knowing our connecting flight left at 12:47. You also know flights close doors 10 mins before actual flight departure time. You gave us 4 mins to make a 19 min walk, according to your own app and it’s directions to different gates and terminals. You changed our flights and assigned us a flight you knew we would never make it to as it is physically impossible. No one, aside from our one amazing flight attendant, did a single thing to help us. We spoke to the gate attendant upon exiting our flight, as per directions from the pilot, and she called the connecting gate, asked if they had any holds, and said “ok nevermind.” She got off the phone and said. “No they don’t have holds. You’ll never make it in time. You’ll have to go see customer service.” She never even told them a family of 4 was literally running to make the connecting flight. We got to the connecting gate 5 mins after the door closed. Our plane sat at the gate for 15 mins before being taxied out. There was more than enough time to let us on. Once we walked back to customer service, the horrible interactions and total lack of assistance with our situation continued. The back up flight scheduled for us had us sitting in the airport for 8 hours. Your “head of customer service” outright called my husband a liar when he explained to her that we had 4 seats, argued with him for 5 mins, then only retracted the comment when he pulled up our boarding passes and showed her our 4 seats. They then filled out the ticket information incorrectly, completely forgot to give my husband a ticket all together, and we nearly missed yet another flight due to the complete and total incompetence of your employees. That same head of customer service also told us we “might get partial refunding for our flights, but she’s not sure.”  I’ve been back and forth with the luggage/claims dept trying to get our luggage delivered back to our house. One agent said it would be here within 12 hours, and by noon today. The agent I’m speaking with currently told me at first that my luggage had been delivered to Tulsa. I called and was informed that it was out for delivery, to our home in Florida. Now the agent is telling me it will be here within 24 hours because it was, in fact, accidentally sent back from MCO to Tulsa. Now our bag is missing all together and “should” be delivered to us “sometimes soon” via FedEx. We shall see… I don’t have a clue what is going on with your airline and your company, but if this is a common occurrence within your company, I can’t imagine you’ll be around much longer. I’ve flown with every domestic airline in the US over the past 15 years and never have I experienced anything like this in my life. We will never fly United again.",-1
2022-08-21,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Zurich,,,,,,,2,Disappointing experience,True,"  I just booked my first award flight with United Chicago to Zurich, Sept 13. Disappointing experience. First, I would choose UA partner Swiss which flies the same route the same day, but UA said no. So, UA assigns me the last row, row 41. I said, no. I'll pay for a better seat. Economy+. OK. 32B, but that costs $229. Swiss charges only $70 for a better seat. I ask about food service on this 8 hour overnight flight. Only one meal, dinner. Knowing that airline meals are awful, I order a special meal: Vegetarian Asian. No breakfast. One can buy a box breakfast. No thanks. Will I have to pay for a plastic cup of wine? AI will buy something nice at a deli and carry it on. United, as others, descend to the lowest common service like Spirit.",-1

It began in Rochester, NY, where the United customer service representative failed to explain to us why our third flight (Frankfurt to VIE) was changed by the airline and then proceeded to charge us for the change, without telling us. She also said it was free to check our bags, yet later we saw that we were charged $75 for each. While boarding our flight in Rochester, the staff began to let people on, but then had to instruct them to get off, because the plane was not ready, delaying our flight further. We had a 7 hour layover in Frankfurt due to the flight change. On the way home, it was just as terrible. What was supposed to be a 4 hour layover became a 7 because our flight from Newark to Rochester was delayed. We were not given any reason why. Upon asking several staff members, they met us with apathy. This is no way to treat tired, anxious customers who have paid good money for their flight.",-1
2022-08-17,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Miami to Chicago,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,she had no interest in helping me,True,"  I upgrade our seats to first class. My children sat next to each other and I was across. The lady that ended up sitting next to me had a dog. I told the attendant I’m allergic and she said ‘Maybe you could get someone to switch with you’. I guess she had no interest in helping me. Though she moved people’s carry ons to help the woman next to me. In the process the attendant hit me in the head, 3 times! The lad with the dog could not get it in the carrier so I stayed on its leash, at my feet. Difficult for me to get comfortable. Especially when it started licking my leg! When food came out it was on its hind legs, paws on the gray tables and it’s owner feeding it! At one point the attendant took the leash and walked it up the aisle. Didn’t think that was allowed? Meanwhile, my throat was closing and tears were running down my face. It was bad enough the first class seating was old and run down but to deal with my whole flight like this was unbearable. Since United is all about their customers I tried calling to complain and get my money back but they would not listen. Complaints are only online, though in 3 weeks I haven’t received a response! Never again!",-1

Then on my way back from LAX to London, the plane had to turn around mid-air again! This time because of the hydraulics. Next, because we are in Europe, the airline is obliged to a refund and should take care of accommodation. This was, at the point of writing, almost two months ago. Customer service has continued to say they would check my case and call me back but none of them do (5 times so far!) For me, this has to be, by far, the worst airline experience I've ever had. Incompetent pilots, incompetent ground staff, and incompetent customer service. I would give this a 0 but that's not possible",-1

2022-08-14,0.8,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Chicago to Heathrow,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,4,thankful for the sanitary wipes,True,"  Boarding began 45 minutes late but proceeded swiftly and smoothly. In fairness, thanks largely to an excellent tailwind, we arrived 8 minutes early. The seat was a rather tired Polaris offering which, despite the delay in boarding being partly due to cleaning staff still working on the aircraft, was more than a little bit grubby. We were thankful for the sanitary wipes provided when boarding. The seat is comfortable with a choice of two pillows, slippers and an excellent duvet for this overnight flight. IFE was mostly older movies and partial TV series and the 'noise cancelling' headphones were the worst I've ever experienced. When announcements interrupted the movie I could hear it clearly both on the headphones and the cabin speakers at the same time. Noise cancelling nil! The cabin crew were great and the food was acceptable for dinner but I did not like the breakfast offerings so did not bother. I managed a good four hours sleep.",1
2022-08-13,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Chicago O'Hare,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,2,a terrible experience,True,"  We were supposed to have a flight on August 10th at 11:15 am. However, once we boarded the plane, we were informed that the screens needed for flight were down (a mechanical problem) and that it would take another 10-15 minutes until we could leave. Unfortunately, ""10-15 minutes more"" became the anthem for the next four hours while we remained in the plane or wandering the tarmac, hoping that finally we could go home. At around 3:30 pm, they finally informed us that it was certain that the flight was canceled and the next flight would only go out at 11:15 am the next morning. This meant that we lost a whole day to this United mishap, which posed a problem for us as I, alongside my wife, had work the next day because of prior commitments that we couldn't take off more time for. This cost us an entire day of income and it is already difficult to organize a trip together due to the fact that we have two daughters in college with different schedules. After deplaning and taking out all of hand-carry luggage, we were made to wait 1 extra hour just for our luggage, which never even left Paris as we never did, to come. Then, we waited in line for another few hours to receive our new boarding passes and information for the hotel where they would put us up. They also expected us to use the airport shuttle that stopped relatively far from the hotels when most of the passengers on the flight had a lot of luggage that we were made to drag and walk with by ourselves. We ended up having to pay for a taxi to take us to and from the hotel because it would have taken us even longer and would have been quite a hassle. By the time that we left the airport, we had been there for approximately 11 hours (from 8 am to 7 pm) and had wasted the entire ""extra"" day in Paris because of United's troubles. The next day, luckily check-in was relatively easy, but when boarding was delayed because catering came late, and they began to say ""just 10-15 minutes more"", I really thought that this was it, we were going to get a canceled flight again. After all, that's how it started the day before. Luckily, we were able to board the plane starting 11:10 am (flight was supposed to lift off at 11:15 am), which caused approximately a 30 minute, which honestly was fine considering everything else that happened. The rest of the grievances are minor in comparison, but after the complete shit show that United puts on every time we fly with them, it's important to include. There is usually a 50/50 chance that the charging port at your seat doesn't work and for a longer international flight, this can be quite annoying. A flight attendant also questioned my identity and asked to see my passport because I was shown as ""missing"" even though another employee had been the one to scan my boarding pass and I had gone through the several (maybe even useless?) clearances required in the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. In addition, after asking for an ice cream after the flight attendant handed out ice creams to everyone but me, the flight attendant proceeded to point toward my stomach and said mockingly that he thought I was trying to lose weight. Now, I understand that he was trying to make a joke, but after the United shit show, I wasn't really in the mood and I think being strangers, that comment was just very strange and rude. Overall, flying with United is a terrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you want things to go wrong.",-1
2022-08-12,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Paris via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,Not for families,True,"  Not for families. I have a love/hate relationship with United. They are the closest airport to us with a hub, so very convenient. And we do enjoy the United lounge. However, we are a family of 4. A Couple and 2 children. We always book on same reservation and we never book basic economy so that we can make sure we sit with our children. This is the second time United has changed our flight at the last minute and the refused to give us seats together. We are all given center seats and all over the plane. This is ridiculous! I never thought I would say this but Southwest has much better service for families. How can that be??",-1

Everything was late from the flight crew to landing time. Flights were missed and the employees couldn’t care less. They offer hotel rooms on your dime at an unreasonable price. Everyone is extremely hateful and overall they just don't care about customers. Also their WiFi is a joke.,-1
2022-08-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Providence to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"I will never fly United again"" ",True,  Worst service we have ever gotten. Our flight was canceled Jun 22 after we were already on the tarmac. We pulled back into Tf Green Airport and were told we wouldn't be able to get back home until 2 days later because of volume and delays. We booked another flight because we have children at home that needed us. Our original flight price was 580. And the new tickets were 300. So we are 880 in the hole. United only issued us a refund for 260 and gave us a 100 dollar voucher each. Not only do I not want the vouchers I will never fly united again!  I called 5 times and was told I would be contacted back. Never happen what a joke.  It's been 2 months and still no resolve. Trip cost us double what it should.,-1
2022-08-11,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Washington,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1,What a disaster,True,  What a disaster. We landed on time but due to lighting they shut down the luggage belts for 3 hours! The United reps were rude every other airline was receiving luggage. My family was waiting on the storms were done a good hour before they started sending the luggage again. After all that they lost all my luggage so waiting for nothing.,-1
2022-08-10,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Accra to Washongton,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,such unprofessionalism,True,"  My siblings and I travelled to Ghana for our grandma’s funeral on our way back to the USA we encountered an experience on first class that no one should experience. My brother in law was wrongfully accused of recording a flight attendant with his device and threatened that it’s a federal offense. My brother in law respectfully said no and the flight attendant with her manger proceeded to look at the footage on his device to make sure there wasn’t a recording. There was no recording of the flight attendant on his device because he was recording himself and his breakfast. The flight attendant didn’t even apologize after not seeing any footage. She had the nerve to say we didn’t see the whole recording so my brother in law had to show more footage. The audacity of the flight attendant to just accuse someone is beyond me. I was so irritated by the encounter that I approached the flight attendant and in flight manager about the situation to find out what kind of nonsense is this. After I complained to the inflight manager another passenger in first class complained to me and said that same flight attendant was so rude. No one pays first class for an international flight to be treated this way. To say I’m disappointed in the customer service and the experience on today’s United airlines flight is an understatement. Flight attendants must do better because as a former registered nurse that’s not how you treat people.  It’s so sad that those in customer service industry sometimes forget that one day you can be on the receiving end of the same nasty attitude you give to other people. The flight attendant needs to be put on leave or a performance improvement plan to get a reality check. Check your attitude and nasty antics at the door, take a break or retire. But that behavior is unacceptable. No one should be subjected to such unprofessionalism.",-1
2022-08-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to New York via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,my last time with this airline,True,"  I have been waiting for this flight for last four hours. They been telling me, crew members aren't here yet. This is not the first time. Last time I had issue with this flight too. I had ticket with me and when its time for me to hoard in they told me they don't have any seat left despite I have everything thing like my tickets, seats number and everything. I even complained United airlines but they didn't even response properly. This is my last time with this airline. From now onwards I will never buy united airlines.",-1
2022-08-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Melbourne,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst experience ever,False,"  This is the worst airline you can fly with. All the staff were unhelpful and won’t even bother to assist. The check in clerk incorrectly checked my bags to the wrong destination and then blamed me for giving her the wrong information. There is a reason all bookings are on your system so train your staff to use them. There is no such thing as customer service. They can’t even sort out a meal change request because their catering is outsourced. Apparently you need to call in and change 24 hours prior. I have been calling to change this for the past 3 days only to be told ‘we can’t help you, try sorting it out at the airport’. I am a frequent traveller and have visited many countries and flown with many airlines but this has been the worst experience ever. Airlines from third world countries have way better service level and understanding for their customers than United! Shame on you! We pay for your salary and maybe it’s time you started realising that and treating your customers better.",-1

They kept saying to weather but there were no weather issues. My flight was supposed to be to at 6:30am but they rescheduled me to 5am without noticed so I missed my transit flight from Newark to ORD and they took my bags on that flight. I was in the airport until 2pm and they would not rebook me. They kept cancelling every single flight or not taking passengers due to overbooked flights. They asked if I wanted to go the next day. I informed that I cannot because I have work the next day. They still insisted I wait. After arguing from what seemed like forever, they finally agreed to book me with American Airlines. I would not recommend United Airlines. Services is terrible and they are known to cancel and overbook flights.",-1

2022-08-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Los Angeles,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,our first flight with UA but it was a horrible experience,True," My flight is UA1756 on July 29, 2022. This was our first flight with UA but it was a horrible experience. First of all, at YVR, we were waiting for someone to call our group number to be in line for boarding but no one called our group number which is 3. We are obeying the sign (which said be seated till your group 3, 4 or 5 is called). Finally we saw some with group 3 are waiting in line so we then got up to wait in line but we were told we had to leave our carry on luggage to be put away. After landing, no one told us where to pick up our luggage and it asked 4 to 5 UA staff to find out where to pick up. In the aircraft, these flight attendants are not professionals, unfriendly and very bad service is offered. The return flight UA 608 on Aug 2, 2022 was much much better. That is why I will give a one star to UA. Hopefully the good crews are awarded and the bad crews are fired. It is hurting the reputation and this review is going to be posted in the internet as well. By the way, my seat is broken and can't be adjusted.",-1

On this occasion I flew to Berlin on July 22, 2022 and they managed to lose my luggage. I haven’t recovered it as of Aug 5 2022. On my way back from Berlin to Kansas City on Aug 5, after cancelations again and delayed rebooked flights, I am supposed to be in Kansas City at 12.40am, when the expected time for me to be there was 8.15pm. What bothers me the most is the complete lack of cooperation of the employees. However in the end, I hope people who got a nightmare of a vacation because of this airline, demand that their leader, their CEO, be fired. This would be a fair thing to do at least!",-1
2022-08-05,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Denver,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1,United had overbooked the flight,False,"  Nearly 24 hrs before leaving from Omaha we received notice our flight may be delayed due to weather. After checking weather for both Omaha and Denver we were unable to find any type of weather that would delay our flight. Upon arrival in Omaha the next morning for departure our flight was listed as on time. Nearing departure time there started to be a light drizzle/sprinkle (no lightning). All other outgoing airlines were still flying (Southwest, Tac-air, etc.). Our pilot came out and explained he's been flying for over 20 years in the industry and he said we would not be leaving on time. After an hour long wait it was determined we were finally clear to leave. After boarding the plane there was a long delay while stewardess tried to figure out how to fit more people on the plane than there were seats. United had overbooked the flight. Due to this delay we were late catching our connecting flight in Denver which we missed by 6 minutes. Yes 6. United refused to hold our connecting flight fort 6 minutes and we were forced to holdover in Denver and try to find other connections. This was United's one saving grace as the manager in charge of fixing these errors was able to get all 6 of our group on a connecting flight an hour and a half later. Between a pilot who wanted to be overly cautious during a spotty shower and United overbooking our first leg of the trip it nearly cost us our family vacation. Plus never even got so much as a sorry except from the manager who helped fix the mistake and only got to talk to her after dealing with a very snippy customer service rep and me losing my temper and asking to see a manager.",-1

The only problem I had, is that I got one of my suitcases broken, but it's a very fragile material. I recommend this airline.

2022-08-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Reykjavik via Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never travel with United again,True,"  To begin, an incompetent United associate scheduled a 52-minute layover at O’Hare Airport. When I discovered the flight change 3 months later they refused to deal with me, even though I was the passenger, and would only talk to my travel agent. They failed to notify me that they changed my flight to something unfeasible. 52 minutes to change flights at O’Hare? Eventually, I was able to get it changed. The two passengers in my row for my transatlantic flight were a 6-hour & 15-minute nightmare. I sat next to a big man who used my leg space, even to the point of touching my leg with his the entire night. I never slept. His continuous loud yawns and his arm and elbow into my seat space didn’t help. Next to him was a younger guy who appeared to be sick. I thought he was going to throw up, but he just burped/hiccuped very loudly for most of the flight. The flight attendants had to constantly ask him to move his legs and feet, which wasn't easy, especially when they repeatedly had trouble waking him when they tried to move the cart down the aisle. Why didn’t the flight attendants notice either passenger and do something? Months before departure I called United with my request for vegetarian fare. Incredulously, the flight attendants asked every passenger if they wanted the cheeseburger or veggie burger on the return flight so that, by the time they got to me, there was only one left. When I told the flight attendant I had preordered, she replied, coldly, “There’s no pre-ordering.” If this is true, why does United offer the ability to do so? The guy behind me was not as fortunate as I. Despite having pre-ordered, they had no vegetarian meals left. Needless to say, he was very upset as he ended up not eating. Why was this allowed to happen? What is the purpose of enabling you to request a dietary choice in advance if it will not be honored, especially after everyone else on the plane is given a choice that ultimately exhausts the supply of that which you ordered? Flight from Newark to San Diego--I had to endure a screaming, crying baby, which began before the flight began and lasted for the entire flight. Every few minutes throughout the flight, this baby/toddler would let out with a high-pitched scream that was painful. Never mind why the parents would inflict this torture on fellow passengers—why would United Airlines? Why didn’t United take action? This 6-hour & 55-minutes was pure torture. Again, United personnel looked the other way. I tore my used anti-bacterial wipe to stuff in each ear. It might have helped a little, but the pieces of paper were not earplugs, so I spent most of the long flight holding them pushed into my ears with my fingers. On the same flight, there was a rude stewardess. She chose to ignore me instead of answering my question when I asked her where she was going with my bag that I had stowed over my row before I sat. For some reason, she moved it down the aisle. Would it have been so difficult to reply when I asked her calmly where she was taking it? Instead, she just gave me an unfriendly look and continued. When the plane was in the air, the cart moved down the aisle to offer drinks, she and another stewardess decided not to offer me a drink, even though they gave them to the people sitting next to me. I wasn't asleep. I had to raise my voice to get them to come back. United Airlines is not the first-class airlines I thought they once were. I will never travel with United again.",-1

2022-08-03,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,separated from the rest of your party,True,"  This is the best airline to choose if you want to be separated from the rest of your party. I rode a flight from Cancun, Mexico to Denver, Colorado and was separated from the person I bought my ticket with, we tried changing seats but it was “not” possible, we were only a row apart so it wasn’t that bad. We had a layover in Denver and it happened again, however, this time we were separated by 20 rows and I was placed in a seat which one would have to pay for. I spoke two of their kiosk agents, both who had said I had to pay to move my seat but to my knowledge, if no one buys the $92 seat next to me, the airline would assign someone automatically. The kiosk agents said they had no supervisors to speak to and to wait for a physical agent. My party was not the only one affected on this flight, there were at least 5 other parties that were, one being a family of 6 that had little kids involved, the agents did say this was the only way they would change seats but everyone on our flight was separated. Our physical agent fixed all of our seats but it makes no sense to automatically separate parties in the first place- especially if you’re going to give one of the members a seat you would otherwise have to pay $92 for.",-1
2022-08-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to London,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,I won’t fly with United again,True,"  Booked the trip through Lufthansa, despite paying a high ticket price for the round trip (>1,500 $), I was put in economy basic fare. Having a Lufthansa Senator Status, I assumed the staff would try to accommodate and provide service where possible. On my inbound flight with Air Canada all worked very well and was put in a good seat. When I politely asked United staff whether I could change my seat, the man at the gate made fun of me saying ""she has basic economy"" and turned around not caring. Even though I understand that basic economy does not include a seat selection (which it does on most other star alliance flights for status customers), I would assume to be treated in a nicer way. Frankly speaking, I have a lot and have never been treated this way as a frequent traveler. Simple put: they don’t care! I won’t fly with United again, unless I have to.",-1

I was traveling from Europe to Nashville via Chicago with United Airlines. In Chicago I saw my baggage for the last time, it was my last connecting flight. After arriving to Nashville my baggage was lost, I went directly to customer service, ask them what's happened and I submitted claim for delayed baggage. They told me that it usually takes five days to find delayed baggage. You know what? It's already 7th week and I still didn't get any information about my baggage and they didn't even pay for my lost baggage. I'm just student and I had in this luggage stuff for 3 months and I lost everything. This airline absolutely doesn't care about their customers and they even don't trying to solve problems. This would never happen on European Airlines. I can't understand how bad attitude can have this Airlines to customers. It's the last time what I have flown with United Airlines, so be careful if you want to fly with them. Thank you United Airlines that you made my first stay in US so hard I will never forget this!",-1
2022-08-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Scranton,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,United you are the worst!,False,"  United is giving Spirit a run for its money for worst customer service. I had a $1,100 flight credit and I tried to use it on 2 flights. One was flight $389 and the other was $455. I was told by a very rude customer service rep that I could only use the credit on one flight. Not only that. Any left over value would be forfeited. So I had to find a flight that was close to $1,100. That is completely unacceptable! Southwest Airlines would never do that! United you are the worst!",-1

What does all this loyalty lead to? Apparently -- not very much. On a recent trip from BWI to DEN and then back to IAD, as a GS flyer and using PlusPoints I was unable to get an upgrade on either leg -- and this despite there being many open seats in first more than 72 hrs before each leg. In addition, ground ops at both BWI and DEN were horrid with deplaning, cleaning, and boarding taking so long that time was unnecessarily lost. I appreciate that challenges that all the airlines are facing, but this is now getting pathetic and embarrassing. What is worse is that there is no ownership of the issues or any effort to genuinely apologize for the poor service delivered.",-1

Bad flight beginning to end, an pleasant start to a dream trip to Hawaii: flight was delayed because pilots arrived late, and then we waited another hour in the plane while they waited for paperwork to come. They allowed numerous passengers to bring 2 and 3 pieces of full size carry-on luggage, like suitcases and large duffel bags! Many passengers who followed the rules and only brought the 1 allowable piece of luggage ended up not having space in the overhead storage! When I mentioned something to the steward about that, she told me to just worry about myself. Really? Flight attendants never checked bathrooms, never replaced paper towels to dry hands or emptied the overflowing trash bins - halfway through the flight there were no hand towels, there were trash piles on the bathroom floor and trash actually in the aisle on front of the bathroom and the bathrooms were gross! Flight attendants could care less. To top it all off, we had to wait 45 minutes for our luggage at baggage claim. Crappy, uncaring service - come on United Airlines, do better.",-1

2022-07-30,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Chicago,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,Never had a good flight with this airline,False, Columbus to Chicago. Rude and uninformative staff. They put tags on some carry on when boarding without saying why and had us leave them outside the plane with a ticket in hand saying “pick up at gate”. Apparently that meant before gate and with no bags there some continued walking to the actual gate. The lady at the reception desk was very rude and immune to listening when she thought we were idiots. Never had a good flight with this airline.,-1

I am standing in the Priority line and see there are two people waiting on one guest. Then, one of the United workers call the next person to wait on, with no regard to me standing there. So I say ”is this the priority line” then here comes this guy to get me over to a machine that tells me that I can’t check my bags. He says you have to check your bags an hour before your flight - well I would have been able to had there been people working at the desk. So as I still waited on this individual that is unprofessional, incompetent, and ignorant to put me on the next flight, the horror worsened. Long story short, I missed three flights leaving OKC going to Chicago, then am told that they can book me a flight for the next day, Saturday. Had I wanted to fly out on Saturday, I would have booked my flight for Saturday and not Friday. They expected me to sleep at the airport, not happening.

So happy to go to Hawaii and than this happiness turn to a nightmare. As soon they start the plane the smell of the gas went inside in the cabin. The plane had a mechanical problem. They keep us for four an half hours on the plane. After 4 and half hours they decided to let us out of the plane .We waited 2 more hours at the Airport until they got another plane to take us to Honolulu.

2022-07-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rochester to Fairbanks,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,My family and my friends will never fly United again,False,"  My daughter was scheduled to leave on Saturday, we arrived at the airport 2 hours early, no plane showed up, there was no one around to ask questions to, after the plane was scheduled to leave one employee showed up and was quite pleasant and explained that there was a rain delay. No problem, she was quite helpful and pleasant even tho she was quite outnumbered by anxious passengers. That flight was canceled and my daughter was scheduled to leave on the same flight the following day, Sunday. Now, Sunday was a mess. There was only one woman checking bags and people in for 2 different flights, she was stressed, and quite short tempered. I’m sorry, but it’s not the customers fault that people don’t show up for work. Once checked in my daughter went through security and made her way to the gate, where once again as departure time came closer there was no plane and no one around to help. After boarding time was supposed to start one lady showed up to talk to the waiting passengers. She was quite rude, she said the plane was running late, but it wouldn’t be a problem and everyone just needed to wait. When my daughter tried to ask about how late the plane would be, because she was worried about missing her connection, she was told to sit down and wait. No questions answered. The plane finally arrived 20 minutes late, the employee that was there then announced that the flight was overbooked and until someone gave up their seat the plane would not leave. By now people were frustrated and basically laughed in her face. Instead of threatening passengers I’m sure she could have found a better way to ask someone to give up their seat. They finally boarded the plane, and then proceeded to sit on the plane for 40 minutes, the attendants then told the passengers that they needed to call in a mechanic for a possible bird in the engine, and to expect it to take an hour. They got off the plane, and within 10 minutes they were reboarding, people expected it to take an hour so they had left their seats to find food, the rude employee then announced that the plane was going to leave without passengers because they had walked away. Completely unnecessary. My family and my friends will never fly United again. Her plane finally left over 2 hours late, and if the employees had handled themselves properly it would have been much easier.

Our Tucson flight was canceled. We attempted to get a later flight into Phoenix but the customer service agent on the phone refused to book us because the only seats were business class. After arguing for 20 minutes and asking for a supervisor the seats were gone. The agent indicated he could not issue a hotel voucher. I had to stand in line for 2 hours to get the voucher. United sent us to a filthy, seedy hotel with no shuttle service back to the airport the next day they were all booked. Now we are finally rebooked on a flight to Phoenix which is further delayed. We will have to rent a car and drive to Tucson.",-1
2022-07-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Midland to Houston,,,,,,1.0,1,canceled without e-mail or message,True,  I got a message from United Airlines saying that my flight has been delayed from 7:15pm to 11:52pm on 7/24/2022. The surprise is when I arrive to Midland Airport my flight was canceled without e-mail or message. I talked to the customer service they told me that no flight for me today. I had to find a Hotel at that time and a rental car.,-1
2022-07-25,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to San Francisco,4.0,,4.0,,,5.0,3,could not provide a blanket as requested,False,"  I have been a passenger on United Airlines flights for over 22 years. But this is the first time that I got sick after the flight. The 4 hours and 40 minutes flight from Chicago to San Francisco was delayed for a little over 30 minutes. The flight attendant could not provide a blanket as requested. He said they have no more supply of blankets. It means I have to tolerate the cold for over 5 flight hours. After landing, I had fever, sore throat and cold. The total flight duration from Italy (temperature of 100 degrees) was 22 hours and 41 minutes with 2 connecting flights. The 1st two Lufthansa flights were generous with blankets. United Airlines should have provided a blanket too and could have made a difference.",1
2022-07-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Little Rock to Kalispell,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1,Customer Service was a nightmare,False,  Don't book with United if you are flying into or out of Little Rock. They delayed and cancelled to and from when traveling from this destination. Stuck in Denver for over 12 hours and they had no solutions on how to get my wife and I home. Customer Service was a nightmare! They did not help us at all. We had to pay for flights for the next morning on Frontier.,-1
2022-07-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Charleston,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1,United does not care,False,"  This airline is giving me the worst time ever. The over was fine, I requested a vegan meal and I didn't get one but that was fine. However, now I am trying to leave Berlin at a different date than I originally bought my return home ticket. I have been on the phone and texting with United for the past 3 hours and I have gotten nowhere. They convinced me to buy an upgrade so that my flight can be changed and now say my flight can be changed but there are no flights for my class, so I bought that ticket for no reason because now the only flight they're telling me I can do is 700 dollars which is almost as much as I paid for the ticket anyway. United does not care and they will not help you unless it puts an exorbitant amount of money in their own pockets.",-1
2022-07-21,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Washington,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,3,8 year old is 3 rows from me,True,"  Probably one of the worst airlines ever, flew with my two kids 8 and 12 and they couldn’t even have us sit with each other even though half of the plane was one person. They could of easily switched two other people to sit with each other when asked why an 8 year old is 3 rows from me, the agent said he doesn’t “make the seats”, when a minute before he made an announcement that he assigned the rest of the seats very interesting!  Would not recommend them at all. I am sure i will try my best to never fly with them.",-1
2022-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Kahului,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,terrible experience with United,True,"  I would like to share my terrible experience with United to spare potential travelers of the pain and suffering I endured. I was held hostage by this airline and their unprofessional dealings for 36 hours. This included the pilot, expired food, fake vouchers, rude crew, and general incompetence from the staff. My vacation to Hawaii was tainted by this experience, and I will never fly with this airline again. Due to made up excuses that were thrown around which included “staffing issues,” “mechanical issues,” “work hours,” and “fueling purposes,” all the passengers of this flight were upset because United toyed around with its passengers and kept giving us false hope about getting us to Hawaii. Around hour 10, United decided to pass out free waters and snacks; these were expired granola bars and fruit snacks.  Finally, we thought there was hope when the Captain of the aircraft came and made a grand speech about how he’ll get to our destination for sure that evening. He even received a standing ovation and cheers. We still waited 2 additional hours after that. Then when we finally were able to board the plane, the stewardess threatened all the passengers saying that if we do not board under a certain amount of time, we would not be able to fly out to Hawaii. This is when I knew we were never getting out of there. All 300 passengers worked together to quickly board the plane. The plane just taxied for a half hour around the runway and made an abrupt announcement that his staff could unboard. Then, the captain lectured the passengers that we essentially ran out of time and could not fly. We were all held in the plane for another thirty minutes until we could unboard. They would not let us exit because the customer service line was already way too long. Apparently there were more United flights that had issues. When we finally were released, there was a massive line at customer service. Workers did not know what was going on, and lied and said they ran out of hotel vouchers because they did not want to deal with the long line. Those who were lucky enough to receive some kind of voucher got hotel rooms (instead of cots they offered for use in the airport) and none of the meal vouchers worked. We were finally able to fly out to Maui the following morning; of course it was delayed by two hours. We had the same captain who completely changed his demeanor because management was around, but it did not fool any of the passengers.  One stewardess yelled at us for trying to stay on the plane longer than we had to. Another stewardess  said we cannot leave the plane without handing in the survey, which by the way they provided nothing to write with. Avoid United airlines at all costs.",-1
2022-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Durango to Pittsburgh via Denver,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,United truly failed all my expectations,False,"  Everything about the flight back from Durango was absolutely horrible. We got an email at midnight saying our 730am flight was delayed. We tried getting on another fight, it was at 3, there were no United workers at the desk to check bags, waited 30 mins. That flight was delayed because the last at check in said she cloudy figure out computer. We get to Denver late 435,our connecting flight had to be boarded at 5:01. That pain took forever to take off. And now we are in Pittsburgh sitting on a plane for 50 mins so far, and can't get out of the plane. Pilot said there was nobody at our hate to meet the plane. Then he blamed it on the weather. United truly failed all my expectations. This was my first and last time flying with them. When I should have been in Pittsburgh at 3pm originally. I don't understand why you email in the middle of the night to try and screw people that need to be places. We picked those times for a reason.",-1

Allow 2 hours from bag stop to boarding and you’ll be fine. Aircraft running 15 mins late, boarding organised, staff pleasant. Take off a little late but time made up en route. All staff worked hard and were both visible an responsive. Aircraft clean. Good service overall. Prompt arrival and baggage off fine Good flight",1
2022-07-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Medford,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst I have ever experienced,False,"  This airline has been the worst I have ever experienced in the 8 years I was in the military. I have flown every other airline and have never been treated so poorly. My flight was late and it was the last flight of the night, so I was going to miss my connection at layover. Once checked in I was told to speak with customer service on the phone. When I did, rather than comping me or helping find a later connection with another airline, the united “customer service” member canceled my entire flight. When I stated “No, No. I am not in my home city do not cancel my flight.” He said oh I see I will reinstate the ticket. He confirmed he reinstated it and I waited another hour for my flight. When I attempted to board I was told I couldn’t because it showed it had been canceled. When I explained what happened they didn’t care and said there was nothing I could do. They said I would then have to purchase a full priced ticket for the next day if I wanted to leave. In the end I was on the phone for literal hours, stuck in a city I didn’t live in, with no bags, because they were put on the plane and after asking to speak to two different supervisors they finally booked my tickets for the next day. No comp, no sorry no nothing except the bare minimum and no understanding from any member. You also cannot purchase anything on flights without the app. They repeatedly said that as everyone else was boarding. I will never be using United airlines again and I will always recommend people pay a little extra to go with any other airline.",-1

My flight was changed 10 times. I was suppose to leave at 4:19pm and ended up leaving at 8:10pm. The gate was changed 5 times. The employees at the counter were very rude. I never would fly with them and will not recommend them at all.,-1
2022-07-19,0.3,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,San Diego to Eugene via Denver,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2,I am very disappointed,True," My original flight that was supposed to arrive in Eugene at 4pm was cancelled and they put me on a new set of flights that added 4+ hours to my travels and has me arriving at 9pm. By the time they put me on the new flight, all the free seats were taken so I had to pay $100+ extra just to secure seats on both these flights for the cheapest available seats. I arrive with my carry on that I have used as a carry on over 4 times with United and at the gate they tell me it is too late and make me pay an additional $45 for it to be checked. I am very disappointed that I have to pay all this extra money when United messed up and cancelled my flight to begin with. At the very least I should have been offered free seats since I had free seats on my previous cancelled flight.",-1

He helped us out of the way. His fabulous job is really appreciated. Everybody was so good, they are doing remarkable job. Our flight was late, but pilot was sharing all information to passengers about the flight. This flight was very comfortable and I will always remember how Angel Chavez helped me and my wife.",1
2022-07-17,0.3,Business,Economy Class,"Victoria to Tulsa via Vancouver, Denver",3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,Pathetic people handling,False,"  Pathetic people handling. My first flight was delayed from the origin, ended up late at the second airport, with all the security checks and passport verification, missed my connection flight. Their help desk denied their fault but promised to help me book another flight. I had booked a travel itinerary of 12hrs approximately from origin to destination. Due to their poor coordination and weak flight schedule, they helped me by increasing it to 17 hrs! As a cherry on the top of the cake, the made me walk between counters, them and Air Canada, until 10.30 am after landing at the second airport at 7.45 am. Also their idiotic staff boards the air plane in FIFO method (First In First Out) instead of the sensible LIFO practiced by most airlines, thereby chocking the aisle and filling up the overhead storage. Would not recommend this airline to anyone.",-1
2022-07-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Unbelievable mannerisms from that flight attendant,False,"  One of the staff members told me to put my backpack underneath the chair which I was complying to, but she then started to rush me and even went as far as kicking my backpack that had a laptop inside. She even had an angry look on her face because she seemed annoyed with me and then with the person in front of me, when she was correcting them about putting their bags under their seat she seemed much nicer to them. I am really upset by how she kicked my bag that had electronics inside and now my laptop is a little different than before. Unbelievable mannerisms from that flight attendant.",-1
2022-07-16,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Honolulu to Washington via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolutely abysmal,True," Honolulu to Washington via Los Angeles. I had to find a place to write a review, which aught to provide some indication of how poorly I thought of the service. Before even boarding the flights my problems began. I have had multiple flight cancelations resulting on rebooting for both my outgoing and returning flights. What United provides complimentary is a joke. On some flights there are outlets for charging, but they were not working on mine. On no flights was there in-seat entertainment screens. Meals must be purchased if flying anything other than first class. Even flying first class doesn't provide access to lounges. Absolutely abysmal. Leg room is non existent, even when I paid to upgrade to economy plus. Between the cancelations and the lack of service benefits and extra fees, I will do everything I can to avoid flying with United in the future. Please find other options for yourself.",-1
2022-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Chicago to Newark via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,violates federal disability regulations,True,"  I have been recently injured in a motorcycle accident, which broke a few of my bones. My first issue is that the United personnel refused to help me lift a bag into the overhead compartment, despite my disabilities, which violates federal disability regulations. Then, a delayed flight caused a missed connection, which is not a huge deal in itself, but caused a lot of other issues. I was automatically rebooked from a first class seat (which i need due to current disabilities/ injuries) to a middle seat, so I lost the in-flight meal i was depending on for both lunch and dinner after a hectic day of issues caused by United. I also had just a few minutes to run across the Denver airport with multiple broken bones, my arm in a sling, and 2 bags because they refused to hold the 2nd plane. I was certainly not at fault for the first plane being late. This cross-airport run caused me severe pain and suffering throughout the entire flight from Denver to Newark.",-1
2022-07-15,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Newark,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3,could do a better job regarding food and drinks,False,"  It was an okay flight and just barely okay service. Food is terrible. The flight attendant gave me the wrong meal (out of two options) and was nowhere around by the time I realized. All the passengers were made to discard their water before boarding, but during the flight drink was offered only twice, for 11 hours flight. To get more water I had to go to the flight attendants. They could do a better job regarding food and drinks.",-1
2022-07-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Los Angeles,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,The staff were just chatting and laughing with each other,True," Horrible! Slow to board passengers. Then sat in the plane at the gate before taxi out for an entire hour past take off time. Then sat on the runway for another 20 minutes only to be told there was a problem and had to go back to the gate. The employees of United seemed to take all of this in stride, don’t seem to care that we are well over an hour behind schedule and people are missing connections. The staff were just chatting and laughing with each other and don’t care at all about the situation or passengers. This all seems common place for them.",-1
2022-07-14,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Laramie to Bismarck,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1,try to never fly with them again,False,"  Changed my flight at least 5 times, even when booked 3 months in advance. Many hours in the layover in Denver, and when I tried to get the ""free"" airline change for another date (with another time schedule) it turned out to be $50 per person because of a ""Transportation Fee"", ""9/11 Security fee"" ""US flight Segment tax"" and ""US passenger Facility change"". I understand these costs, but they told me it was a free one-time change! Total BS if you ask me- such a scam to get more money for their own issues. I hate United and I will try to never fly with them again, because this kind of stuff always happens. Don't book with them!!",-1

However even with so many set backs, United Airlines staff was exceptional. The agent that provided me with food voucher was unbelievable under pressure.",1
2022-07-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Newark,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,lied to me saying I would be reimbursed,True,"  Both flights of my trip were cancelled and messed up.  My Friday flight was cancelled, and I was not booked on the next flight they booked me for the 5:33 pm flight and not the earlier ones. I waited standby for 2 flights since I was already at the airport at 8:30 am, the third one I was going to wait standby got cancelled but finally made it on the 5:33 pm flight. I was 7 hrs late getting to Newark airport and I missed half of my Friday event. I also missed a full day of work on Monday because they cancelled my Sunday flight. The United Airlines customer service person at the Newark airport couldn’t give me a voucher for the Sunday night hotel that I was now going to have to get since my return flight had also been cancelled while I was flying to Jersey. They also hadn’t booked me for the next available flight but one that was 24 hours later than my original one, then while I was waiting in line about the voucher that rebooked flight was cancelled and they tried to rebook me for Tuesday morning flight (I would have had to stay 2 nights & miss 2 days of work). I was able to get them to book me on one of the earlier flights on Monday when I got to the counter however they could not give me a voucher for hotel. They gave me a number to call to get a voucher. I called and they said they couldn’t give me any voucher over the phone, and I would have to book a hotel and pay for it myself and then would need to try to get reimbursed after my trip. I have tried to get a refund on my flight and to get reimbursed for the hotel, but they denied it. I put in for the refund and filled out 3 Customer care feedback forms to try to get reimbursed but nothing. I even tried to contact the CEO by email and got no response either. I want my refund for the flight and reimbursed for the hotel. Again, I was 7 hrs late getting there and missed half of my event, had to pay for hotel and missed a day of work. They denied my hotel reimbursement and I have requested multiple time mam’s copy of the phone conversation where the agent lied to me saying I would be reimbursed. Oh course they are refusing my request for the proof that they lied. I suggest never fly with United Airlines.",-1

I spend at least 100k per year. I booked an international flight, with the assistance of a United customer service representative. I did this to ensure there would be no problems with my trip. My connecting flight was delayed. United told me they could not get me on another flight for 2 days, that I had to remain in another country during that time, and they would not give a hotel voucher, because I used miles to book the flight. I will no longer be using my United credit card.",-1
2022-07-12,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Koa,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,4,"Friendly, experienced, proactive and calm",True,"  A busy morning at LAX. Paid 100USD for a heavy bag 2 kg over weight. I could have repacked but didn’t want to and staff were very helpful actually. No lounge as it was an economy flight. Boarding prompt and on time. Aircraft relatively new and well maintained and clean. On time departure. Cabin crew went round promptly with drinks/ snacks. It was a full flight. The cabin crew were delightful and a true credit to the airline. The stewardess Mrs Donovan and her colleague whose name I sadly cannot remember who looked after our cabin were very good indeed. Friendly, experienced, proactive and calm. They were on hand throughout the flight, if one was visiting the toilet etc then they would ask if you/ family were ok, did you need drink , snack etc. on top of this they worked hard to keep toilets clean which on the max 8 is difficult as they are tiny and an awful design. I was previously sceptical about North American carriers have had sup par experiences with American Airlines previously but feel that this flight which was my first with United, achieved a level of overall service that I have not seen in many airlines for some time.",1
2022-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Vancouver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have ever flew,True,  The United airline rep took my bag and say they going to check it in for me. But they never did. They took my bag but never send to to my arrival destination. I ask and call many times but they never found my bag. Literally the airline take my bag but never register it or sending it to me. Now I lost a luggage with all my clothes and valuable in there and they never gave me a clear answer of when or where my luggage is. This is the worst airline I have ever flew in my life. I don’t know how this type of airline with such terrible customer service still be in business.,-1
2022-07-09,0.8,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Chicago,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,4,The service was very good,True," Overall we were quite pleased. The service was very good, the IFE system had lots of options including a ton of movies, the seats were lie flat, a bit narrow but comfortable enough and the food was OK, not as good as we have had on biz class on ANA or Asiana but good enough. I suppose flying biz almost guarantees a higher level of service and food but really no complaints at all. I have to give mediocre marks at best for ground service as frankly matriculating thru LHR was a nightmare. Even with premier status we had to get into the general security check line which seemed a half a block long and by the time we got to break off into the gold channel it was 30 minutes from the time we put our items on the trays for scanning until they cleared them. That's how long we waited. That's not getting your moneys worth to be sure. Staff were indifferent at best.",1
2022-07-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Albuquerque to San Andres via Houston / Panama,,,,,,1.0,1,not going to ever fly United again,True,"  I’ve decided, I am not going to ever fly United again. I paid for a ticket in full last month. And when I started trying to book another flight I found plenty of flights for about the same price or less than what I paid last month. I was supposed to have a credit for $1100 dollars. I found flights for $750. But when I went to use the credits that I had. All of the sudden now the flights are $2500. Meaning I have to pay additional charge of $1100. And I got charged $250 to use the money I already paid. But since it emergency I go ahead and pay the extra. And after I finalize the transaction. Instead of a confirmation code I get an error code. And a message to call in. So I call and the agent is trying to help me book the flight. The agent wants to charge me an additional $2800 to book the flight. And tells me there is no other flights available. So very upset now I hang up on him and go back online. I find the flight again and have to go threw the whole booking again. This time my card gets declined. I go and check my transactions and it shows my card has already been charged for $1100. So I assume I’m booked and paid for. But I go to United site and no upcoming flights , no reservation nothing. So now I’ve paid $2200 and still no flight. The charge is pending on my account and since I’m already paying double for the same ticket I have no money to even try and book a new flight. United don’t care. They don’t see the flight, the payment, nothing even though I sent screen shots. They advise me to reach my bank. My bank says since it’s pending they can’t do nothing and that it won’t post until 7 days. Back to United and still nobody cares.  I have to wait for this pending transaction to either post or get credited back to my account. Surely by then there will be no more seats left on the flight that I already paid $2200 for. And if there is they will want me to pay an additional price I guess for the same seat I saw for $750 this morning. But if you are trying to use a credit. That seat turns into $2200. This is how United treats their flyers.",-1
2022-07-07,0.8,Business,Premium Economy,Sarasota to Edinburgh via Newark,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,pleased to say I was impressed,True," Sarasota to Edinburgh via Newark. As a loyal Southwest and Delta flyer, I was hesitant to book on United especially after their many PR disasters in the last half decade. However, I booked it due to the cheap fare. I was pleased to say I was impressed. My first flight, UA750 from SRQ to EWR was off to a bumpy start due to weather in EWR. The A319 was actually the 100th ever made and its 25 years of age didn't show as its sports the newest United cabin. The crew were great doing two beverage services. The flight took nearly another two hours due to routing and holding patterns and even a almost diversion to EWR. Thankfully, we made our connection onto UA36 service to EDI. The 757 was old, and had the old interior. Pleased to say it was not bad, but i think the new interior would have been nice to have. Food was fine, not better than Delta but not worse either. Anyway, an on time landing into Edinburgh was also appreciated. Overall, the crews were great, the aircraft were fine, if a little old (both aircraft were 25 yrs old) and the food was acceptable. They delivered on their part of the bargain which is all I care about in the end. Good job UA!",1
2022-07-06,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Des Moines,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Horrible experience with United Airlines,False,  Horrible experience with United Airlines. When booking online I received a message to call customer service to finalize booking. Everything was good until I placed that call as requested. She couldn’t locate my future flying credit and had me on hold for about 45 mins (mind you I didn’t need help with the credit being applied. I already had that part done). I believe she was stalling in order to finalize the booking at a higher rate. I had to pay $411 more because of her being so lackadaisical and again stalling during the call. Then I get to the day of the flight — they lose my bag with all of our clothes for a 3-day business trip. They claim the bag is in Chicago but we’re in Iowa so I’m confused?! The airline wasn’t even packed so how do you lose a whole duffel bag during an overlay? Like take the bag from one flight to the next - united has incompetent staff with no regard for how their actions effect others. Now I’m on the phone with customer service who is also no help. Said my bag was located and would be on the next flight out but that was a lie. 7 hrs later still no update from United. I’m still unsure on where the baggage is.,-1
2022-07-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Dublin to Los Angeles via Chicago,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3,We were lied to,True,"  Dublin to Los Angeles via Chicago. But the nightmare continued after we boarded the Dublin flight. It (Dublin to Chicago) was delayed because of loading luggage, and also because there was no headset for cockpit to communicate to ground crew so we could push back. So we were an hour late into Chicago. We had a 1 1/2 hour lay over in Chicago. We got to the gate in time but when the attendant scanned our passes, we were told there was no ""Clarks"" on this flight, We had automatically been rebooked on a later flight and our seats had been given away (to whom I don't think United should rebook people on a later flight without giving them a chance to make the flight first (unless it has already taken off). We got on the flight from Chicago to LA, the one we were originally scheduled for, on stand by status, but because there had only been about 15 minutes between the flights by the time we landed and deplaned, our luggage did not make it. My husband and I were unable to sit together and the flight was uncomfortable the whole time to LA. United announced on the plane that we could track our luggage on their app, it wasn't working. We went to the baggage desk at baggage return, and arranged our luggage to be delivered. My husband got an email saying it would be delivered at 9:30 the next morning (July 3), so we waited at home all day. 1 pm he called United, they said it was on a truck and tried to contact delivery company. My husband was told by United that it would be delivered some time this evening (July 3). When he asked what that meant, he was told by 6 pm. At 8;30 pm, we still didn't have our luggage, so he called United again, this time they could not reach delivery company. July 4th we got another email saying it was on the truck, with a link to track our luggage, it was not working well either as it showed the driver all over the place and there was no way he could have gotten from place to place that fast, impossibility. My husband texted the driver but got no response from him. About 2 pm, my husband called United again, and we were told that the driver still had 75 stops between him and us and our luggage would be delivered before 10 pm. We did finally got it, but it took two days. We had plans to go to friends house for the 4th. Were we expected to stay home for 2 days to wait for our luggage, really? Even UPS and FEDEX give you a window. We were lied to.",1
2022-07-05,0.6,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Dublin to Los Angeles via Chicago,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3,given the wrong information,False," Dublin to Los Angeles via Chicago. First there is no way to check in electronically before arrival at the airport. And there was no way to contact the airline as we tried to find out if there was a luggage weight limit. And because we were booked on Aer Lingus, we could not check in electronically for the 2 United flights to follow. Third and the most important: we were given the wrong information! The lady at the check in desk at Aer Lingus said she could only give us the boarding pass for the flight on Aer Lingus from Glasgow to Dublin. All of our flights were booked through United, United is the one that put us on Aer Lingus. She said she could not issue our boarding passes for the connecting flights from Dublin to Chicago and Chicago to LA. She told us we would have to go through the ""transfer center"" in Dublin. THERE IS NO SUCH THING! The people working there (Dublin airport employees) told us we would have to go through customs, downstairs and go to United check in desk, When we got through Irish customs and to the United desk, the lady said our flight was closed. She worked on her computer to get us on and we were given our boarding passes for Dublin to Chicago, and Chicago to LA. But then we had to clear Irish customs and security again, and then we had to go to USA pre clearance- security and customs again with long lines for all of these. I was very upset and anxious the longer it took, it seemed like one line or queue after another. Our layover in Dublin was only 2 hours and we almost missed our flight. We were finally cleared and ended up running across Dublin airport to our gate. I was anxious, upset, tired, in physical pain and it caused stress between my husband and I. By the time I boarded the plane, I felt ill. (I am disabled) It all could have been avoided if we could have gotten our boarding passes either at the Aer Lingus check in gate or she could have told us to go to United at that time or if we were allowed to check in electronically ahead of time, but United and Aer Lingus don't talk to each other.",1

Kiosks would not print my bag tag and I had to wait in line a few times to just get the tag. I eventually missed the flight by a few minutes.

My first time flying with United and will be my last. Flew from HNL to SFO with 2 checked bags. Had a 16hr layover in SFO and had to go get my bags, recheck them, and go back through security. First airline I have ever flown with that didn’t move checked bags over to the connecting flight. And yes my connecting flight was also with United. Not only that when I went to retrieve my bags security wasn’t even open to go back through. So I had to wait in the pre-security area for them to open. Get it together United.

In MRY you could tell the flight would be delayed from earlier flight, but never let people know it was delayed. Then in Denver they said my flight was on time 10 mins before my flight. I had to sprint from gate 90 something to 40 something. Then after boarding it get delayed. If they would have notified people when they knew I would not have had to sprint 50 gates. Then when boarding they made me check my carry on, and there was plenty of space in overhead bins. Fly Southwest if you can, way better.",-1
2022-07-03,0.7,Solo Leisure,First Class,Washington to Charlotte,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,would fly United Express again,True,"  This is my first time reviewing a flight I have been. I will start with airline itself which while bearing United Express is operated by Mesa which does flights as United Express up and down the east coast in the E175 and other aircrafts. When I was boarding the plane boarding was fairly easy and we were told ahead of time that there would be limited service and bags would most likely need to be checked on the aircraft as it was a full flight. I don't remember how many bags were checked but it was a lot. Upon boarding we were all given santaizing wipes, and boy did I need one for my particular seat 4A as it was not particularly clean on the windowshade, tray table, plastics, and air controls, why does everyone insist on putting their dirty fingers on everything? Anyways, the seats around me were cleaner by the looks of it. I was just unlucky and I couldn't trade with another first class traveller as no one wanted to move. The seat featured a socket, an adjustable head rest, and a lot of padding (can't say the same for economy and I am glad I upgraded early on as the flight filled last second.) The seat was quite comfortable with a lot of pitch and recline for a regional jet. Enough about the seat, lets move on to service. Initially, we were told there would be no service, however more on that In a bit. On the ground we started off with orange juice and water as well as the complimentary COVID bags United is still giving out with Pretzels, Nuts, a stroopwafel, and water. Unfortunately, the flight attendant in the front managed to spill some orange juice on the tray she was serving from and the plastic cups were wet at the bottom, I really shouldn't have taken the water as it dripped on me and the drink holder that was also attached to the seat. She did apologize about that as the previous crew had managed to shove things into the compartments making it impossible not to spill. She then afterwards proceeded with the safety briefing and collected the trash before we took off. Once in the air service did improve for First as she had to delay the in-flight service a bit due to the captain thinking there would be more turbulence than there actually was, again more on that in a bit. She managed to serve first class with both alcoholic beverages and regular ones as usual, however she referred to everyone by our names, guess it was passed along somehow. Very professional. Economy However, did not get service as the periods of high turbulence made serving 68 people impossible as soon as she started she had to sit down. So anyways. I managed to get through my flight looking at the in-flight map as well as looking at movies and shows to watch. I do have to say I enjoyed myself and would fly United Express again.",1

I've arrived at LaGuardia today July 3rd at 2:30am flight to Houston at 5:30am. I couldn't board. Waited till the next flight taking odd at 9:30 am, couldn't board. My ticket was purchased months ago. I received an email regarding my flight a day b4 or shall I say, hrs b4 my flight. Stating that my original flight was canceled and I'll be placed on stand by. This is horrible! At 10am I was told, that I will have to take a cab to Newark for a 5:30 pm flight. They paid for the cab and gave a food voucher. United airlines think that's enough to make up for their errors. It is unfair. I'm running on no sleep for the past 28hrs. I'm missing my nieces birthday party in Texas. And I am highly exhausted and frustrated. I'm still taking flight cuz I gave a promise. But this is unfair, and unprofessional of united airlines to do such a thing, at last min.",-1

The issue is not with cancellations or delays some or most are understandable but with the actual product ie. their employees and aircraft, not sure which is worse but packaged together shows this airline doesn’t care about the product, their employees have no pride with their employer, pitiful. We flew fas a family of four first class Houston-Honolulu. Each was the aircraft was filthy, seats were less than average to poor condition, one seat back was broken causing it to slant back and to the left. Three of the four planes we flew the lavatories were absolutely disgusting. Once aboard, customer service was non-existent, never offered head phones. Basically saw them during food service then gone. The lead FA was more concerned about being noticed than his customers. Return flight no better with the exception that approximately five minutes before boarding we were told the planes monitors and wi-fi were not working and to download whatever we needed to for the over five hour flight as we were boarding ! Not enough space to continue. Emailed our complaint after receiving a “How did we do” email for the first flights and received a form email with a $50. Credit for future traveL, I will never fly United again. United should be embarrassed but obviously not because they don’t care.",-1

They refused to help us at the ticket counter. Made us use the self serve machine despite needing assistance. Rude agents and ticket counter assistances. Switched our prepaid seats, which we paid extra for to ensure my husband and I sat together, moving us into different rows and seats. When asked why the response was; families traveling together needed to sit together. You are not allowed to bring a carryon onto the plane when you buy and economy ticket.

2022-07-01,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to St. Louis via Chicago,3.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5.0,5,seats were just uncomfortable in general,True,"  Last fall I flew with my dad from Jacksonville, Florida to St. Louis, Missouri to tour a college with two layovers, one in Chicago, Illinois going to St. Louis and one in Washington D.C. coming back from St. Louis. The flights from Jacksonville to Chicago and from D.C. to Jacksonville were great, and the meal box my dad and I shared from Jacksonville to Chicago was delicious. The flights from Chicago to St. Louis and from St. Louis to D.C. were unfortunately more lackluster compared to the prior two. This is really only because the seats on the planes they were on were tiny and my dad and I were squished together like sardines despite the seating being in a 2-2 configuration. To give you an idea of how small the seats were, I’ll tell you this. My dad and I are both “bigger” if you know what I mean, my dad being bigger than me. On the planes my dad couldn’t buckle his seatbelt all the way due to his size and he needed a seatbelt extender. Now despite him being a bigger person, he’s never had an issue with seatbelts fitting him on airplanes and he has flown quite a bit in his life. I’m a decent bit smaller than he is and even I had to squeeze a bit to fit in the seatbelt, and beyond that the seats were just uncomfortable in general. Now the planes for these flights were operated by a regional airline so naturally they were smaller. I’ve since checked United’s fleet and I’m pretty certain that both of the planes were CRJ 550s. However everything else about these flights were great and the first flights I mentioned were on bigger jets so the seats were much more comfortable. The flight crew was polite and attentive and once again the food on the flight from Jacksonville to Chicago was great! Another positive was when we got off the plane at D.C., we had to come off the plane using the stairs not the “tunnel” (I don’t know the technical term) for some reason. I have a fear of falling down stairs and these were really steep. The ground crew was very kind and helpful in helping me get down. If you’re thinking about flying United I would say go for it just try and make sure you’re flying in a plane bigger than a CRJ 550, especially if you’re a larger person.",1

I asked them to give me a copy and I can fill it out quickly, they could not find it in their system and called someone else, but leisurely left on our own. We approached the desk, one agent took the matter seriously and searched for over one hour to find the form, until one supervisor told them to why are they wasting their time, issue the boarding ticket and let the passengers go. At the time we had 20 minutes to get to the plane. At that time the agent charged us for two luggage, (we were entitled to 4 free luggage). There was no wheel chair to help us thru the inspection area. We were hoping to fined help and wheel chair in the other side or an electric cart which we requested in advance. Nothing showed up, we had not choice to walk all the way near the gate until an electric car until an electric cart helped us to the plane. Inside of the cabin we found out that they sold our seats which was reserved for us with disability and forced us to seat separate to the seats# 34k and 32b. No matter what we said to the flight attendant, the answer was rude. The meal was very poor. On the return flight to Houston from Frankfurt, there was only one person with wheel chair to help all the disable passengers who left us waiting the the beginning of the Tunnel. I received one email from the customer service who apologized and claimed to add 5000 mile points to out account, I replied to take it back and do not insult us with their generosity. if you are disable, please make sure to hire you own driver because at United they do not care. If you are going for a overseas trip, take you dinner otherwise you will starve. If your seat is reserved, do not get angry if you find our your reserved seat was sold for a higher price.",-1

This being our baby’s and pet’s first flight, we were really excited and were looking forward to a pleasant journey. We had already communicated with the United Airlines regarding the dimensions of the pet carrier and purchased one accordingly. Please see the attached screenshot of chat history. Check in went smoothly and we passed the security gates without any hassle. However as soon as we boarded the flight, we were very rudely stopped by a flight attendant and informed that we won’t be able to fly because of the size of the pet carrier. Shortly thereafter, we were asked to take our seats and boarding continued. The same flight attendant, very rudely repeated in stern words multiple times that we will not be allowed to fly and we were ushered out of the plane with a pet and a crying infant. We were traumatized, disturbed and insulted. We will never ever fly with United. Under the pretence of following rules, we were subjected to a lack of basic human courtesy! What should have been a pleasant journey turned out to be a nightmare. Please be aware that United doesn’t care about passengers with families and pets.",-1

United was carrier for Lufthansa flight. Tickets booked said no charge for 2nd bag. They charged me $95 “per United policy” otherwise no check in allowed. Paid. They also changed seat from Aisle to middle and way in back for 8 hrs flight. Why?- “we changed airline, don’t ask any questions about seat change as plane changed. Your seat is sold.” CS Manager at O’Hare cared less about both issues. She says - “Ask Lufthansa for a refund.” Pathetic service and it will go downhill from here if they don’t improve.",-1

Before the pandemic (covid) if you booked and paid for your ticket approx 3 months in advance you used to get a nice discount, not any more. I guess United are trying to get back the money they lost during the pandemic and it is screw the elderly (who are promised a discount but do not get one), and the frequent flyers. I have just paid for my wife's ticket and the previous day to her flight caused a price increase of $500.00, guess United presume the price of gas is going to skyrocket on July 19th. Looked at the price for my ticket going in September and I get a discount of $45.00 I am surprised they can afford it. The food has never been good and United are not the only airline this applies to, but now it is even worse, I mean they should be embarrassed beyond belief. You now need to pay for anything descent. I am pleased and surprised they do not charge for the wheelchair to take me to the gate, that is of course when you can get someone with a wheelchair, I have a bad heart and a pacemaker but sending someone with a wheelchair does not make United any money, in fact causes them to spend some, so I understand. We will still fly United as we think they are the best for this journey, it is just a shame the older you get the more they want to screw you.",1
2022-06-25,0.6,Business,Economy Class,Ottawa to Chicago via John Wayne,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3,All in all not a terrible experience,True,"  All in all not a terrible experience. But I flew on 4 different planes during my trip and was surprised at how varied the experience is between flights. Communication with customers to let them know what services will be available on their flights would be a great help. One flight would be a newer plane with individual screens, charging stations comfortable seats. and the next would be a plane from the 80s with none of these features. The app would not work for me - I had uploaded a credit card on the ground - but it did not work on any of the flights - as this was the only way to pay for food, I was left making sure I bought snack prior to boarding (which was disappointing). I Asked several employees for assistance and they were not able to help (they were friendly and willing, but not able) and mentioned that it was a common occurrence. Staff on all 4 flights, and check in was friendly with the exception of the check in staff at John Wayne. It appears that they might be overworked and they were generally unpleasant and unhelpful - in their defence it was 5AM and 2 large flights were checking in (there appeared to only be 2 staff members) but I assure you that no one felt liked a valued customer during check in.",-1

We were shuttled between terminals A and C four times before they cancelled our flight. I then stood in customer service line for four hours to get reissued tickets for today 6/23. No hotel accommodations offered even though the airline agent who was working with the travel company I used to book the trip had indeed said hotel accommodations would be made available to us. The agent was almost indignant telling me it is not a policy of United to issue hotel vouchers. The couple in front of me were issued hotel vouchers. I did Receive two $10 meal vouchers once I got my reissued tickets only to be told by the airport food service outlets that they were closed. I went back to the counter to request a cot and blankets and was told by the same United agent a cart would be coming out soon to get cots. So, spending the night in the Newark airport is what I had to do. Im hoping my travel insurance will cover the trip interruption and lost day of work and not to mention the inconvenience. I understand the airline industry is going through challenges at this time but the lack of compassion and empathy the staff displayed was uncalled for.

Flight was delayed on both ends, no entertainment, no food. Kept us on a hot plane in Florida for almost 2 hours. A/c didn’t work. Wi-Fi doesn’t work (which you need to use their entertainment app). This airline makes no effort to provide any level of service. Not customer service, basic airline services of being on time and having working planes. Pretty pathetic.",-1
2022-06-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Chicago via Munich,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,impossible to check in with United,True,"  I purchased a return flight between Chicago and Athens. in the way there, both flights were operated by United but the return flight had a leg operated by Aegean. I had to check in with them, no big deal, but it was impossible to check in with United as I kept getting a message telling me this last leg was operated by another airline, which it wasn’t. I could not change seats or do anything. I tried calling, but was discouraged by the 60 minute wait time on out of country phone rates. I tried messaging but was never able to connect to an agent. My layover in Munich was only an hour and as I wasn’t checked in, made for a very stressful transition and back of the plane seating. Not life threatening but frustrating in the face of all the rhetoric purported by United. Friendly Skies, what a joke. I give them a one out of ten because of the general niceness of their crew",-1

We just flew 16.5 hours in the last 5 days, this had to be the one that we felt the most taken care of. Major shout out to Claudia Chavarrio, Elizabeth Villacreses, Giana Duong, and Tyler Arrington. Flying with a 2.5 year old and 1.5 year old is plenty of a struggle but they gave us plenty of comfort on this leg of our journey. The patience and kindness they showed us won’t be forgotten. As well as giving us a good laugh when we needed it.",1
2022-06-20,0.9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Kahului,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,5,Economy Plus was well worth the price,True,"  I flew from San Francisco (SFO) to Maui (OGG) on June 13 (flight 2623), and returned on June 17 (flight 1639). Economy Plus was well worth the price for these 5-hour flights! The seats are comfortable, especially if you bring a blanket and a small pillow for your lower back. They gave us small, thin blankets that are great to roll up and use as support for your neck/head. Pretzels, soda, and water are free. They sell basic meals that you pay for with a payment method you must indicate before the flight; they don’t accept cash or credit cards on board; it’s an entirely contactless system. There was no WiFi available because we were flying over the Pacific ocean, but there was free entertainment (movies, games) accessible via your phone/tablet/laptop. There are USB charging outlets between the seats, and you need to share the 2 plugs among the 3 seated passengers in your row. On both flights, all crew members were great. The flight attendants were permanently available, very efficient and friendly. On the return flight, right before closing the doors for departure, the Captain stood at the front of the cabin and made a warm welcome-aboard announcement that set the tone for an enjoyable travel experience. Because of the excellent flight and cabin crew, these flights in Economy Plus were a huge improvement compared to my two previous United flights in January when I flew in Business (PTY-HIA) and in First (HIA-SFO) class and at that time felt disappointed. I think I’ll stick to Economy Plus from now on, because ultimately what makes the difference is the crew, not the type of (expensive premium!) cabin you pay for. The only reason I’m not rating these two flights a 10 out of 10 is that I think United should give at least a _token_ extra snack to Economy Plus passengers. An important note about SFO: right now there are massive issues with staffing shortages and construction blockages at this airport. I got my boarding pass on-line and pre-paid for my checked bag, so at the airport I only needed to print the bag tag at a kiosk and drop off my suitcase, which was quick. The terminal was like a chaotic human beehive of stressful activity. For over 1 hour I was in a haphazardly-moving line that at times blocked access to offices and lounges, snaked around escalators, etc., with almost no guidance from staff, before I reached the entrance to the beginning of the usual line for the Security Screening area. I arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure, hoping to have my usual time to kick back and enjoy a sit-down meal and a beer before the flight, but I came out of Security with only 25 minutes to spare before the flight started boarding. If your flight departs from SFO in the near future, on ANY airline, I suggest you consider arriving 3 hours in advance for domestic flights.",1

I didn't get the standby flight and proceeded to customer service after a 3 hr wait. Lost one bag after waiting 7 hrs in the airport. Went back the next morning where they informed me that my luggage was sent to my final destination city without me in spite of the flight being cancelled and filing a claim, that's height of incompetence. Waited whole day for my bag to make it back after repeated assurances, only to be told at end of day that since i was on standby to fly to Seattle on Sunday, the checked-in missing luggage stay in the final destination, since I would be going there the next day at this point.

Hope FAA has some better customer ""Bill of Rights"" that protects traveler's from such inconveniences, Just because they can. The penalty for a cancelled flight must be multiple times the cost of ticket, so that airline don't jump the gun in trying to cancel a flight if it is not booked completely.

We do understand that weather can cause delays and cancellations (we had three) and that the date we travelled was a record for these events, but the United Airlines staff, with a few notable exceptions showed absolutely not empathy or human compassion. They showed basically that they did not care and mistreated their costumers in all occasions. We travel a lot but will make sure that we will never fly United Airlines again.",-1

They would not refund my ticket after cancelling my flight. I would not even be there to take the return flight because they cancelled my flight to get there. The agents working the desks at the airport went to hide for 30+ minutes before they sent out the final cancelation email notice.

First my flight was delayed just before we were ready to start boarding due to some thunderstorms, then it was canceled. I tried getting the next flight but was put on standby. I didn't get the standby flight and proceeded to customer service where they informed me that my luggage was sent to my layover city without me, pretty sure that's illegal. I asked them to make sure that my checked-in luggage stayed in my layover city since I would be going there the next day at this point. I then flew to Philly but a few hours after landing in Philly I got a notification on my United App that my bag was being redirected to Philly. I then got on my phone for 8hrs! trying to reach customer service about my bag but just accepted that United Airlines was too cheap and lazy to give their employees a phone. And of course it was out of the question to treat me like a human being and refund me some money for their screw ups. I then had to drive all the way back to Philly airport to see if my bag was in Philly or my layover city because nobody would pick up the phone! I tried tracking my bag from their website using my ticket, baggage receipt and my bag tracking stub but none of it helped me find my bag....none of it. After lugging myself back to the airport they told me that my bag was in fact in my layover city. I am now flying to my final destination today, a day late, but lost my business class seat on my new flight. First time ever not flying in coach (I was so excited to finally have the money to treat myself for the first time but scratch that, United is here to ruin your day). You people are the absolute worst and turned what was supposed to be a fun vacation into a nightmare. I don't care what your excuses are, my bag should never have been sent to a city without me and your total inability to help your customers is unacceptable.",-1

My return flight from Washington DC to Seattle was canceled last night. After 4 hours of talking to United customer service and 3 hours of customer service line in the airport, they did absolutely nothing to give me a next flight home. Not even a blanket or pillow, they scheduled me for a flight from Seattle to Washington, not even knowing Washington DC is different from state of Washington. When I reached back again to tell them I was sick and needed my medication they did nothing but being rude. The customer service lady told me “I can’t do anything, I can only give you options to choose” and when I asked her what my options were, she said she didn’t have any options. She asked me to stand by. Terrible customer experience and no one was responsive. Customer service lied to people’s faces they had changed their flights, but the next morning when we showed up to out flights they were all either delayed or full.",-1

And their staff has zero customer care attitude. They just could not care less. The flight was delayed due to a windshield issue. With a 6:30 pm departure, the message about delay is sent only at 5 pm when all the passengers are bound to be at the airport. Then it is going to be 7 pm departure. Then they cannot find a gate and it js 8 pm. Then it is a new gate at 9 pm. Then the flight attendants are missing and it is 9:30. And by the time the flight leaves is 10 pm.

2022-06-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Chicago,3.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,3.0,1,been my worst travel experience,False,"  Worst travel experience I've ever had. My flight from Cincinnati to Chicago was delayed 2 and a half hours due to maintenance issues and then we sat on the tarmac for an hour + because the ac wasn't working and the power went out. By the time I arrived in Chicago I was over 3 hours late and missed my connection. I was told United booked me a hotel but they never sent me a confirmation number for my hotel. I was left to wonder around the O'Hare airport after 10 o'clock at night until I found an employee that would help me, but then I kept getting mixed information. I finally received a confirmation number and found the shuttle station only to find that the only hotels offered were 20+ minutes away and none of them had a shuttle service. I found a taxi to take me to the hotel I had selected that was 8mi away, but I was told by United staff NOT TO CONFIRM my selection until I had reached the hotel to check in. Because I did not confirm my selection, the option was removed in the middle of my transit to the hotel and I was only given the option for hotel 16 and 17 miles from the airport. I ended up having to pay a $140 taxi fare for a 30 minute drive to my hotel and was never provided a transit voucher (which other passengers said they were told they would receive but also never got a transit voucher). My connection was booked for the next morning for Denver at 8:48am and my final flight to Fresno at 11:21am. My Denver flight was delayed for an hour and a half before we even got on the plane and, as the day previous, I was stuck on the tarmac for over an hour in a plane with no ac, crowded conditions, and people getting sick from the heat. We arrived in Denver at around 11:50am, half an hour after my connection took off. My connection to Fresno was rebooked at 7:07pm. I spent 7 hours wandering severely sleep deprived, nauseous, and in pain through the Denver airport. I had high hopes for the 7:07pm flight because my plane had a record of being on time or early with no complications at every other flight it had that day. It was not until 5 minutes before the plane taxied into the gate that we were informed that our flight was suddenly delayed by an hour and 50 minutes. I have sat here in this airport for the past 9 hours, the past two hours watching my plane sit empty, no staff in sight, no apparent maintenance being performed, and no reason provided for the now 2 and a half hour delay. I had a very short, much needed vacation planned out for this weekend, and I have spent half of it traveling with an incompetent and time consuming airline. I will have to take United again in a few days to return to work and I'm already dreading. I will never be booking another flight with United Airlines. I have flown numerous times since the age 3 years old and I enjoy traveling and the experience of flying. This has been my worst travel experience I've ever had.",-1

I usually fly with American Airlines but decided to try them this time. They are deceitful in their promises. I called at least 5 times between April and June to ask if I could get a voucher since my flight was an overnight flight plus a waiting time of 16 hours. I am traveling with a child. All the agents I had spoken with, were unanimous in saying that I would receive one at the counter when I was going to arrive at Houston's airport. It was all a lie and not only that, the staff was extremely rude and heartless. Did not care for my situation and not even apologized for the lies this company makes.  Had I known, I would have found a hotel for me and my daughter at least a month ahead. I would have saved money too, but now it's not worth it. Definitely not flying with this company again and I will make sure to let all my friends and family know how poor and nonexistent deceitful company this is.",-1

After 30 minutes in the customer service line trying to figure out our next move, the customer service rep for United Airlines took her time to find different options to help my group. she helped us for 3 hours even after her shift. She did not give up on us. She was extremely patient and caring and didn't show any frustration as I know we were not an easy group to deal with. She kept her composure the entire time and even helped us get a hotel and coupons for breakfast and dinner. She even helped get the taxi to go to the hotel I could ask for better help, she went above and beyond for us, she was a perfect example of what a customer service rep should be like. I now would consider flying more with United and definitely will refer my friends and family.",1

I traveled in economy class and didn’t expect much but the flight attendants were super hospitable and caring. My first flight was from Oklahoma City to Denver then from Colorado to Portland . The flight from Colorado to Portland was the best. There was one flight attendant in particular who was super sweet. I’d like to brag about him a little, his name is dug and he was so kind. I got up to use the bathroom and I love milk, I asked dug if I could have one and he said of course. The milks were already open probably from people who ended up not wanting them. He apologized and I said it’s perfectly fine. He then went and found me one to drink, I was shocked that he took the time to do that and then proceeded to ask me and many other people if they’d like any other snacks and he’d bring them in his hands and it made multiple people happy. He was doing his job beyond what was expected and I know these things might seem small but it really does make a difference.",1

This has been one of the most torturous days of my life. I cannot even begin to explain how frustrating and mind blowingly awful this experience has been. My initial flight was delayed due to a mechanical error so I was rebooked through another airport. When I arrived my flight was cancelled altogether and no food or hotel voucher was provided for my overnight layover. I then had to fly standby in the morning and received confirmation that my bag was on board. It did not however show up at the carousel and after 7 hours of waiting at my home airport I am STILL without a bag or the ability to file a claim. I suppose I will remain here until I die.

2022-06-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,tortured experience,True,"  Denver to Fort Meyers. On May 14, 2022 I called United Airlines (UA) to determine my credits. After getting the value ($550ish) I decided to continue with the agent and book my flight. Three and a half hours later, with many ""I need to speak with my support staff"" the agent ran my card and said it was not accepted. Panicked, I provided another card and it was also ""not accepted"". In the meantime, I contacted my bank on the landline and was told UA had made multiple charges (thousands) against my account and had depleted the account. They had also charged the second card. I informed the agent of the situation and provided confirmation numbers, and requested a supervisor be party to the ongoing tortured experience. They complied and the supervisor canceled the original reservation and created another stating she had upgraded me to economy plus at no extra cost. My original reservation was upgraded to economy plus at my request as I wanted checked bags and early boarding at a net price of $1000.00 after credits applied. The new reservation was about the same. Curious, at no extra cost? Did I mention that my bank told me it could take days to repair my account, did I mention this a 4 hour telephone call, did I mention there were innumerable ""excuse me I need to speak with my support staff"" did this on a Friday night, finally did I mention that I'm a retired mature person? Anyway, I expressed my dismay and they suggested I contact unitedairlinescustomercare.com. Also painful. Ultimately, UA customer care noted that the supervisor had upgraded my reservation ""at no extra cost"", again curious, and considered the case closed. Defeated, I accepted the futility, and took a long night trek to calm down. End of story? Nope. While confirming my ticket prior to the flight, I notice I had not been upgraded, and was charged an additional $160.00 for my luggage and had been assigned a bulkhead seat which I had clearly stated I did not want in the original reservation. Total cost for round trip flight was, as best I can determine, $1800.00, as I stared at a bulkhead separating me from first class that cost considerably less. It's ok, on my return flight yesterday, I left a Chex trail mix bag and plastic water bottle in the seat pouch - served cold.",-1

We had a terrible experience with United and their customer service. Our flight was delayed for over 24 hours. We got on and off two broken planes, I twisted my ankle climbing up the many ramps. We didn’t eat, didn’t sleep, lost out upgraded seats we paid for, out hotel costs tripled because of having to change days and our vacation destroyed. I was assured customer care would help us kindly, yet I received a very unacceptable and unfair response from the representative, after I was assured at the airport and over the phone that we would be helped. I’m not a complainer but this was truly very discouraging and we felt like we were not valuable customers. My boyfriend will probably never fly again and I will ensure my company friends and family steer clear of this airline. I've never had such a terrible experience and I fly often. All of the people on one of the flight received the same compensation which was appreciated, but we also faced a previous 4 hour delay and then had to cancel another flight due to a recommendation due to weather and were not offered anything to make up for all of the stress, lack of sleep and food and loss of time and money on our short trip. I honestly expected more from United and I’m very upset by the response and coldness/lack of understanding from customer care. I truly expected better. They gave me a 2500 mile credit worth less than $25 and insisted I be grateful for that. Just terrible and utterly disappointed.",-1

Their passenger rights are completely outdated as they offer no compensation at all for flights that they cancel even when they get you to your destination over 12 hours later (the next day) than you had planned. I had a layover that was cancelled “due to weather” even though other United flights were leaving that same airport with no issue. Just a way for them to get around owing you anything. I then was out on a flight reaching me to my destination a day after I was supposed to, which I couldn’t do because of work. After reaching out to them, they offered no explanation and had poor customer service. I never complain about anything but I will NOT be flying them again and you shouldn’t either.

2022-06-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Des Moines via Denver,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst flying experience ever,True," Salt Lake City to Des Moines via Denver. Worst flying experience ever. I am never flying United again. My first flight was scheduled for 8:30, it got delayed eight times, ranging from 30 minutes to hours for each delay. No explanation except ""mechanical problems."" Gate was switched three times. Gate staff were nowhere to be found, I walked all over the Salt Lake City airport, checking each United desk for help and there was none. When I did finally find someone, after the flight was already delayed by four hours, all they said was the plane was ""in flight."" They would not answer any questions or provide any other help and were extremely rude. They would not let me onto another flight going to the same place because ""you can't fly before your checked bags."" The United app was extremely glitchy, wouldn't show where our plane was or any sort of update, and didn't give all of the options for alternative flights. Their website also kept crashing. Our gate ended up being in the basement and we had to take a bus to get to the plane. After finally starting to board the buses, we were informed the plane has another mechanical problem. We had to de-board the bus and then re-board again 20 minutes later. The desk attendant was extremely rude and only escalated the situation when some people got a bit angry, which was totally understandable. Then we sat on the bus for 30 minutes for no apparent reason. We were finally wheels up five and a half hours after we were supposed to depart, so most of us had spent over eight hours at the airport. The only apology we received was from the captain. I obviously missed my connection to Des Moines, so spend another three hours in Denver waiting for a later connection. Finally boarded, spent forever on the tarmac waiting to take off. The air vents were so loud and the loudspeaker wasn't working, so I couldn't hear any of the safety briefing or any announcements on the plane. When we landed, we pulled up to de-board, then turned around and sat in the middle of the tarmac. There was a thunderstorm going on. At this point the thunderstorm was projected to keep going for hours and I was about to pee my pants so I got up to see if I could use the restroom. I walked up to it and before I even had to chance to ask the flight attendant, she yelled at me that we were on an ""active"" landing area and I must return to my seat NOW. (Maybe the captain said something, but I don't know because the intercom was unintelligible.) I went back and started crying. Over 30 minutes later (still storming outside) we pulled up again and finally de-board. I sprinted to the restroom crying hysterically. All I got from the flight attendant was a sheepish ""sorry.""",-1
2022-06-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Shannon via Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never use United Airlines again,False,"  The only reason I have ever flown this airline is because it has a hub at my local airport (IAH). If I could give this joke of a company a zero out of ten, I would. At the check in kiosk in Terminal C of IAH, we booked two checked bags for $140 to Shannon. When asked why they were so expensive, we were instead shamed for being Basic Economy customers. We were supposed to arrive at Newark Liberty for our connecting flight, but instead we were diverted to Baltimore because of storms in the New York area. The weather is obviously not United's fault, but the only help we got was from another rude kiosk agent who would only answer questions about our canceled flight to Newark and not about our connection to Shannon. Just as a side note, we arrived in Baltimore at 11:15pm. the agents words verbatim were ""I know you didn't ask to fly here but I didn't ask for you to come to my hometown either!"". Airlines would normally give you a pre-booked hotel voucher, but all we got after 3 hours at the BWI kiosk was a $130 voucher where we had to find and book a hotel ourselves. The next morning, we were finally told about our connecting flight from Newark to Shannon by the BWI kiosk staff, but it wasn't even good news. Instead, we learned that we had been booked onto a flight to Shannon from Newark the day after we were due to arrive in Newark! We ended up begging the United staff once again to get back the seats that we had booked, and all we were given were standby tickets that would maybe, just maybe, put us on the flight we had booked if anyone else couldn't make that journey. Luckily, we were notified later on that we were booked back onto that flight. But wait, that's not the end of it! My brother and I checked our luggage in when boarding onto the initial flights, and when we finally arrived in Ireland, we were shocked to find that my suitcase had severe damage to one of its wheels and my mum's Microsoft Surface Pro was covered in cracks. Overall, I will do everything in my power to never use United Airlines again. Fly the Friendly Skies should not be this joke of a company's catchphrase.",-1
2022-06-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Panama City,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,45 minutes to check one person,True," Houston to Panama City. This was my daughter's first time flying alone and the check in process was a nightmare. We got there 2 hours early as the instructions told us too. The line for the unaccompanied minors wasn't that long but the check in desk spent 30 or more minutes for each person they were helping. There was a lady who came over to help the people in front of us who didn't speak English and she didn't speak their language either, the person that did was helping someone else, so I said ma'am my daughter's flight is about to take off can we please go around, she then turns with a attitude stating no there in line (mind you she had no clue what they was saying at all) it took another 30 minutes and 3 workers to help them. By the time they got to us our process probably took 10 minutes and we had to be rescheduled because we wouldn't have made it to the boarding location in time. While at the desk I explained to the man that we had been in the line for over a hour and the lady started going back and forth with me as if it's my fault it takes them 45 minutes to check one person in at the time. This lady was so rude and shouldn't be allowed to deal with customers at all. When I asked for her name because I was going to report them she refused and that was the only time she stopped trying to go back and forth with me. The man there did try to make it a little better and I appreciate that but she is a bad representative for this company.",-1
2022-06-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to  Puerto Rico via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst service ever,False,"  United Airlines is ridiculous. We had a family of 15 trip planned to Puerto Rico. We drove 5 hours to Salt Lake City, stayed the night and then arrived 3 hours early to fly out. At boarding they came on and said it would be about 45 minutes because they were fixing something on the plane. Then 5 minutes later said there would be a slight delay because they were bringing a new plane in from the hanger because the one that was there was deemed not safe. That slight delay ended up showing as 3 hours. Then it became 4 hours and then cancelled. We got in line and got on the phone with customer service right away to get our tripped re routed. The service agents there were nice but said there was no way to get our family rebooked but customer service could. So one family member spent 8.5 hours on the phone with them. They hung up on her many times hoping we would give up. Right after our trip was canceled they had another going to the same place that they were overbooked by 3 so they were offering $700 vouchers for people to give up their seats. Not once were we offered anything except $30 voucher to eat at the airport. We were willing to split up the family to different flights to get to Puerto Rico. Then they said they weren’t going to book it but would just give us a measly voucher of $300 which is 1/6 the price of the cost to get to our destination. We also lost out on our hotel and cars that were non refundable. Worst service ever.",-1

2022-06-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Omaha to Rapid city via Denver,3.0,,5.0,,,3.0,1,The lack of courtesy for me,True,"  I always fly delta, flying 3 weekends every month because they are reliable and most of my united flights end with cancellations, or severe delays. Attempting to get home, I booked a more expensive united flight to be home 2.5 hours earlier than delta. I figured it was post covid so I'll give united one more chance. I got to the airport, checked my bag and sat down one gate away due to the amount of people at the gate. I don't know if it was ever announced that our incoming flight was delayed, I looked at the terminal boards, all showing on time. But we are within 25 min of departure and the aircraft we are leaving in is still not even here. So I looked at my app and surely it is still showing on time. I'm hopeful that maybe it is a touch late but we will make it. As I look in the app of the incoming flight I noticed that it hadn't even taken off from the last location. And actually four hours prior to my flight, the incoming plane was delayed even a leg before. So united has known for over 4 hours this flight was delayed and yet I am at the gate and 10 min after our boarding time and no airplane- finally the board changes to delayed. I can understand weather and maintenance, I can understand there are things that just don't go right. However, united had a 4 hour notice that this flight was late and my notification was after takeoff time. If you look at united's mission statements it specifically addresses this. My frustration is united clearly is telling me the value of my time. Had I known, I could have come later to the airport, rescheduled, I still could have gone with a delta flight. The lack of courtesy for me as the paying customer is infuriating. But in my years of flying and especially the last three, this is the united way.  The updates via text or within the app apologize for the inconvenience, if you're truly sorry, then send the update of my delayed flight when you know as your mission statement states.",-1

Today, I was getting on my flight and they say you need to check in your bag. I said I already checked one, I can’t check in bags with laptop and batteries. What am I supposed to do?  So a very disgruntled supervisor walks over and says please come to the side as if I had committed a crime. Tells me checkin the bag with all batteries out of the bag of get on the next flight. I have no option but to comply. When we walk in we see a ton of overhead space not just in premium economy but even economy. Over priced flight tickets with rude and annoying staff, tricks to make you pay more on top of everything else and then make your travel experience disgusting so you would get premium next time or priority boarding with extra $$$ next time.

When they opened the door, I asked flight crew which carousel the luggage will come, they pointed me to the people standing outside the plane, who did not know anything.

United sold us a 13 hour trip to Lisbon. 2 of the flights were late. It took 36 hours and we were in Lisbon for 2 weeks and never received our luggage. Apparently they were left in Newark New Jersey.

Thank you again for your feedback and patience. We look forward to having another chance to serve you in the future.""  I was on my flight from Kansas City to Colorado Springs. There was bad weather in Denver so they routed us to Colorado Springs, while in Colorado springs they would not let us that were final destination get off there. I was on that plane with a 18 month old for two extra hours. They then took off back to Denver and delayed the flight for two more hours after we got there. We boarded and then we're told there was no space to land in Colorado spring so our flight was cancelled. To rebook it was an hour and a half wait, when it is an hour and 15 minutes to Colorado Springs. I now have to have my husband who's driven 9 hours already today come get me and my name 18 month old son from the airport without any clothes or any diapers or any wipes, he is 3 hours past his bedtime.

I wish they had canceled in at least 24 hours not 30 mins? All our hotel bookings got ruined. It occurred at 8.30pm the stuff directed us to talk to customer service which there were 200 people in line already! We wait in line for 6 hours! It was unbelievable! It totally ruined our vacation, there was only two staff helping over 500 passengers! At 3am, we finally got first in line and customer service told us there was no hotel accommodations left and somehow the system automatically rebooked my boyfriend’s flight without notifying him.

2022-05-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Santo Domingo to Providence via Newark,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,flight will be delayed for four hours,True,"  As I write this I am still waiting for my flight home. I started in Santo Domingo, RD. That flight was delayed thirty -five minutes with no explanation or apology. To be fair I have never been on a flight from Santo Domingo that did leave on time. Arrived at Newark thirty minutes late only to have to wait an additional thirty minutes for another plane to leave the assigned gate. My flight from Newark to Providence was cancelled due to concerns about the weather. Those same concerns didn't prevent a flight leaving for Boston within the hour. I had to put up at a hotel at my own expense since the cancellation was due to an act of God. The next flight out was scheduled for 8:20. I arrived at the airport at 11:30, and have been kicking my heels here since that time. By the way, the Newark airport is really bad. I have now been informed that the flight will be delayed for four hours while they round up a crew. Now call me naive, but isn't that the sort of arrangement that should be made when the flight was scheduled? Why was the delay announced only two hours before the scheduled departure? I fully expect this flight to be cancelled with another lame explanation that it is in some way weather related. I wish to heaven that I could personally tell the dirt bag that is the CEO of this crap airline exactly what I think of him and the incompetents that work for him. N.B During the nearly nine hours that I have been sitting in the A concourse, Gates 20-28, not a single flight has left on time. All of them United.",-1

While still in Orlando, they were having maintenance issues and due to the long layover period we missed the connection flight from Denver CO to Rapid City SD. When we landed in Denver we were 5 1/2 hours past schedule! Our flight was supposed to leave around 12:23AM. We landed in Denver around 7:40 PM. Attempting to find any knowledgeable and competent United airlines customer service member is near impossible. Extremely rude, and did not listen to what we were saying. The first Customer service rep we found had no idea what she was doing, then a very rude male customer service man came to assist her and was no help to us at all! Would not help track down or request a spot to pick up our luggage. The man wanted to put us 3 on a stand by list for possible flights, and when explained that it would not work as there is three people in our party and that we would rather find a rental car, he became rude, ignored us and walked away from the counter to leave just the female we had originally started with. We did find an amazing customer service person who listened and helped us track down our luggage, put the request in for our luggage, let us know where to go to pick it up. She also pointed us in the right direction of where to go for car rental information. She was the only one within the whole United Airlines customer service area that was helpful and respectful. We called the number given to us in line to contact over the phone to either find a new flight leaving the next day, or to receive a refund. That call lasted over 35 minutes with nothing accomplished. We were told to go to the app to request a refund because there were no new flights available. Will never fly United again.",-1

The flights are simply not reliable and it is near impossible to actually get someone on the phone when calling customer service. Upon finding out that our flight was cancelled for Saturday, May 21st and rebooked for Sunday, May 22nd the morning of our flight, I immediately called customer service and waited for well over an hour only to be hung up on right after the call connected. Since we were disembarking a cruise ship, we took our scheduled bus to the Orlando airport and waited in line along with countless others who were in the same predicament that we were in. We waited about 30 minutes for service at the counter (not too bad) to find out that there were no other flights available for the rest of the day, so we kept our rebooked flight for the next morning. The representative was as helpful as she could be considering the situation was completely out of her control as weather challenges caused delays and cancellations throughout the eastern and midwestern parts of the country (we were trying to get back to Phoenix, AZ from Orlando). Kudos to the counter rep for her kind help as she was able to provide a hotel and meal voucher so we weren't completely stranded. We got home late afternoon the next day on the rebooked flight.

Upon boarding the cabin was over 90 degrees. They sat us in those conditions for another hour and the cabin was well over 100 degrees at this point. The flight attendants and pilots stated they'd issue a refund on our tickets for this inconvenience. We taxi out to the tarmac where we circled and sat for roughly 1.5 hours. Finally the captain says we cannot take off and returns us to the gate. Prior to deplaning the staff said customer service would be outside to assist with refunds and rebooking. However, no agents were available and they directed us to gate C91 for customer service. The line was long and I stood for 7 hours waiting for assistance before customer service began going home without getting others to assist us. A few agents finally said to find your own way and call the 800 number for a refund. I get my ticket since they said they wont help me and told me I'd get a refund for getting a new ticket. Very unclear instructions from customer service. Now I've spent the last 6 days trying to get a solution only for United Airlines to tell me I can't be issued a refund because both tickets are used. How is it that United Airlines employees told me what to do, I comply, pay extra for their lack of service, and they cannot issue a refund? That does not seem legal or fair. And based on their refund policies I'm entitled a full refund but they are not upholding it and keep rejecting my refund request. 0 integrity from United Airlines.",-1

United being a domestic airline doesn't have the sophistication levels to handle an international trip.

So my family and I made the 8 hour overnight drive from Wichita to Denver. At Denver, the agent was very understandingG of our situation, called United help desk to explain the ICT to DEN leg, refunded for the unused checked bag fee that was prepaid, and even gave us $60 meal vouchers to be used at airport (for all 3 people) - which was generous! The flight itself was smooth, a meal was served from DEN to HNL leg (2 choices - tofu noodles and chicken and quinoa). In flight entertainment was provided too.

Mechanic came to look at the engine and found out a valve had to be replaced. That valve had to come from Nashville and the part had to be driven to Meridian, the Regional Airport we were at. It would take 9/10 hours before the part would reach us. They told us the flight was rescheduled for midnight, so they rebooked us all. 15 minutes after everyone was rebooked, the flight was scheduled for 7am, the following day. Even though there was a lot of chaos going on for 8+ hours, no one lost their cool because we understood things like this happened. We were all just thankful that the engine failed before we took off. The United Staff were very caring, making us coffee, even ordering all the passengers pizza for dinner. They made all the passengers reservations to stay at the Holiday Inn. We all met up at the Airport again the morning of May 5th.

Our final flight was cancelled after 7h wait (3h connection + 4h sliding delay). And finally, one of our luggage did not follow. We were lucky that we selected our flights with high connection layovers. The staff at United are very courteous and helpful. We had many opportunities to test out the customer service and we have nothing to complain about on that front. Of course, they tried to blame the cancellation on weather to avoid covering the hotel, but armed with the United App (very good app), we had real time info on the specifics. Note, United gives a generous 10$US voucher for food in a 30h delay. Still, the app has some glitch, a reroute of luggage (after the cancelled leg) gave us a lot of worries when we suddenly saw that no checked in luggage was associated to that flight). Bottom line, until United fixes their logistic issues, better pay a little more and drop the stress for your travels.",-1
2022-05-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Raleigh via Washington,3.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,had to sleep on the bench at the airport,True,  We missed the connecting flight due to mechanical issue. They made us stand in line for 3hrs to get situated. They were inconsistent in their compensation to the passengers. Some got hotel reservations. Some were told they can’t find them reservations (the ones that got it came later) I didn’t get the hotel but instead they gave me $100 in flight credit (hotel +transportation would’ve been at least $250). The employees took forever due to poor training. I had to sleep on the bench at the airport (couldn’t actually fall asleep). The compensation isn’t worth the three hours wait in line. The supervisor took a person from the end of the line and gave him great compensation and send him on his way to shut him up (poor handling that angered a lot of passengers).,-1
2022-05-24,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Buenos Aires via Houston,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2,I could not use any privileges,False,"  I had 2 recent issues with United. First one was in April when I was heading taking domestic flights within the U.S. Airline staff did not inform the change of boarding time (the boarding time was delayed by about 1.5~2 hours - I went to the lounge - they changed the boarding time to earlier time) to the Star Alliance lounge so I missed the flight. They claimed that they do not have responsibility to announce to the Star Alliance Lounge because it is not operated directly by them. (by the way this is the only lounge accessible to Star Alliance Gold members who are taking their flights in that terminal). They eventually did refund me the missed flight portion but only after I asked for the manager to come resolve this issue and talking with the manager for about an hour. I had to call someone to drive 2 hours to pick me up at this airport. Second one is May, my Star Alliance Gold status was not shown on the boarding pass I received after checking in, so I could not use any privileges that are given to gold status member. I talked about this issue before taking the flight so my status could be updated, but the airline staff said they could not do anything because I already checked-in. How could I check that your airline messed up my boarding pass before I check-in and printout? (I even showed my reservation confirmation mail that I received from this airline that shows my SA Gold status). I asked 3 different staff, each one was telling me different stuff but one thing in common was that “I cannot do anything sorry. Try find someone to help you by calling the customer service)",-1

For my last night in Newark a customer service representative told me to stop by the United desk for a hotel voucher which I did for literally more than 2 hours to be told that representative didn’t know what he was talking about and they can’t give vouchers. And when I tried reaching back to the online representative and explain what they has said they just stopped replying to me.",-1

They did notify us there was a 15 minute time change but unbeknownst to us they changed the aircraft, downgraded us to economy + changed our seats so that I am now sitting in a center seat instead of an aisle seat. We no longer get a free lunch or free luggage. We called them, spoke to a supervisor who said there was nothing she could do. You can’t even get your money back until you have completed your round trip ticket. Instead of downgrading us they should have upgraded us and at the very least let us know this was happening. They just pocket your money. I would call this a bate and switch.",-1
2022-05-22,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Newark via Houston,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,2.0,3,A pretty good airline,False,"  A pretty good airline. This is my return flight from Cancun. There were no delays, everything was on-time. I was in group 5 and can board right away without anyone calling their groups. I got on the plane and they gave me wipes. They also had a magazine I could read. In the middle off the flight they served my favorite cookies. Once we landed we boarded our connection flight. The aircraft wasn't built good enough for this 3 hour flight but I accepted it anyway. I boarded and almost got airsickness so slept all the way there. I would somewhat recommend this flight.",1

No one even apologized. We were in the US for 3 days; it destroyed our trip. Impossible to call the customer service - even though we were premier access. Horrible service as usual with United. You are just a number and since they overbook all their flights, it takes them 2 days to rebook you, even between their hubs (Houston; SF). No specific reason for the cancelation.",-1

I paid for 1st class and they rebooked me in economy and refused to reimburse. Still an open claim. Employees are rude and unwilling to help. I waited 5 hrs to claim my luggage. And come to find out they had already sent part of it with the original flight? Not recommend it to anyone.,-1

I have never flown United and I do not plan to ever again. First flight was cancelled on the 19th of May and then again on the 20th once we flew to our layover in Chicago. Then they gave us invalid meal and hotel vouchers at the customer service desk in Chicago. We didn't find out until we took the shuttle to the hotel, so we had to find a place to stay. Our flight they got us on wasn't even to our original destination. They also took our bags when we didn't want them checked due to an overbooked flight. Also we tried the online service and calling which both were terrible and no help. This was supposed to be our honeymoon and now it doesn't exist because of terrible service. Never fly united. We lost double of what the ticket cost.",-1

Very limited food options (specially for someone who's lactose intolerant, how can you still not consider this), no pillows aboard (or a 7 hours flight?!). Barely some space for legs and the back of the seat wasn't even working properly. One thing that works great tho is your mobile app and tech system that consistently gives you updates. Well done on that.",-1

By far my worst flight yet, and I've had two! If you don't want to waste your money, buy a ticket from a different airline. Seats were terrible, customer service was non-existent, and above all, the pizza was burnt and tasted terrible. Had to sit in the tarmac for 2 hours, causing us to miss our flight. The next flight they gave us was the next day. Fifteen hours in the airport! Don't waste your money.",-1
2022-05-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Newark,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,We will never fly United ever again,True,"  We were scheduled to leave Pittsburgh at 6:14am and arrive in Newark at 7:40am. We then had a connecting from Newark departing at 8:30am and arriving in Puerto Plata at 12:25pm. Upon arrival at our gate in Pittsburgh, we were told that the flight was delayed 1 hour as the pilot called off sick. This automatically made us miss our connecting flight in Newark. In a panic, we tried to work with the Airline agent who told us that there were no more flights to Puerto Plata that day. We would have to get a hotel and fly the next day (Saturday) causing us to miss a full day of our scheduled vacation. We were able to reserve 2 seats on a 10am flight from Newark to Santo Domingo for the same day in hopes of still making it to our final destination on Friday, but a few hours later. The airline agent handled this for us in Pittsburgh. Suddenly, the plane was able to leave a bit earlier than expected and the hope was that we may be able to catch our original connecting flight. We figured maybe we catch it and if not, we have a back up plan. The pilot welcomes us aboard and apologizes for the delay and said he needed rest. This the reason for our delay.  Upon arrival at Newark, we luckily found out that our original connecting flight was also delayed by 20 minutes and we could see the plane as we entered the gate. However, we had to sit for 10 minutes as another United flight had blocked our gate so we did not have access. As soon as the door opened, we sprinted from one gate to the other in hopes of catching it. We arrived, the plane still at the gate and the ramp still attached, but we were refused to board. We begged and explained the situation but still refused. At customer service we were told there was nothing we could do. They also said that we were not a lot to board without our checked luggage since we were traveling internationally. When inquiring about where our luggage was and how to get it for the 10am flight (it’s now 9am) - we were told we could not board that flight. Confused as he was 2 seats, we were told that all flights have 10% overage so the flight was full. Also, it was “too late” as we did not check in. Our Airline agent did not check us in and because we were unable to do so while on our delayed flight in the air - we cannot board. Even though we are there an hour prior to arrival, we are not permitted to board. Instead, we will have to take a voucher for a hotel and two meals and fly out a full day later. We will have to lose 24 hours of our resort reservation. They REFUSE to compensate us for the loss of our full day at the resort nor will they acknowledge a need for a reimbursement for the troubles at their expense. We did everything we were supposed to and we were refused boarding twice because of United. The only thing we were told was to email inquiring about this. Seeing the amount of people at the United customer service line all complaining about the same thing, I would assume this is normal customer service and company standard for them. We will never fly United ever again.",-1
2022-05-19,0.8,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Baltimore to Chicago O'Hare,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,2.0,4,Dreadful check-in experience in BWI,True,"  First leg of trip to KUL. Dreadful check-in experience in BWI. Ground staff were not exactly helpful and generally curt. Maybe because there were so few of them on duty for an early morning flight with a lot of people to check in. I managed to check my bags all the way to KUL but they refused a priority tag on my bag although I was flying premium economy on ANA and had all my flights on one reservation. ANA allows priority bag tags for their PE passengers and I mentioned this to the check-in agent but she refused to believe me. Boarding was done by groups which went off reasonably well. It was a full flight leaving at 645am and we took off on time. Once airborne, FAs were very nice and polite and offered drinks. There was IFE but I didn't use it as it was only a 1hr 45 minute journey. I paid extra for an extra legroom seat which offered a good pitch but the seats were standard narrow single aisle seats and it felt very cramped. We landed on time and deplaned quickly. Only negatives were United ground staff in BWI, otherwise I recommend this airline.",1

Delayed flight coming out of DC, which caused me to miss my connection to Italy. I had to rebook and take on yet another connection. This wasn’t the problem. The problem was that the third party airline would issue my boarding pass for my final flight into Italy about which I called United. They told me to call that airline directly. I did. No help. Waited in the service line for 1.5 hrs. No help—they just told me to call United (who had already told me to call them). On hold with United for 40 mins, boarding my plane in 10 mins and still no answer or boarding pass for my next flight. I have never encountered such atrocious customer service in all my years flying and I will surely never fly with United again and will never recommend them to anyone.",-1

This was my first time flying United and will most certainly be my last, my flight from Miami was delayed due to air traffic which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Syracuse. They rebooked my flight for the next morning, I had to sit in the airport all night without my diabetes medicine or high blood pressure medicine, didn’t offer me a hotel for the night or even a food voucher, it was unbearable. So on top of all of this my bag is lost and still has not been found, I called to talk to someone about a full refund and was told I would have to wait a week to hear back from someone. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with, I will never in my life book with them I’m so disgusted.",-1
2022-05-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Rhode Island,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,recent experience was absolutely horrible,False,  I flew with United back in March and again this month in May of 2022. Both experiences were terrible but this most recent experience was absolutely horrible. I left Miami and had a 2.5 hour flight to New Jersey. When we landed we had to wait on the plane for 3 hours waiting for a gate to open up. We were waiting to get off the plane after we landed for longer than the flight even was. Due to waiting 3 hours to get off the flight I missed my second flight. I eventually made it home and then my luggage was missing and United still does not know where my luggage is. The customer service or lack of I should say has been useless. I will not be flying with United again. They overbook flights and are booking more flights than the gates can handle. I have never witnessed airplane traffic but there was over 10 United planes waiting for gates and everything was a shit show. I would recommend flying a different airline and getting your money's worth somewhere else. Wifi also did not work. We were stuck on the first plane for 6 hours but it was supposed to be a 2.5 hour flight.,-1
2022-05-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Reno via Denver,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1,will never be my first choice airline,True,"  One out of two legs both coming and going had “cleaning delays”. This seems to be the general reason cited for not being on time. Then on 1/2 flights each way, the pilot further announced a “potable water delay”. Come on? You can’t have the toilet water ready knowing there is a flight. Lots of excuses, mediocre airline that charges more than others but delivers less. This will never be my first choice airline. The planes I flew on looked like they were on their last legs.",-1
2022-05-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Singapore,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,service from United was absolutely dreadful,True,"  My direct flight from San Francisco to Singapore was cancelled and the service which followed from United Airlines can only be described as diabolical. Firstly we were informed by the pilot whist sitting on the plane that he was ""just about to take the break off the plane when someone on the ground noticed a fuel leak"". What sort of safety measures is this company taking pre take off if someone only noticed a flight leak this late in the game? We sat on the plane for another hour waiting for the fuel leak to be investigated and eventually we were sent back to the airport. By this time it was 1am. We lined up waiting to speak to United staff to obtain more information however the queues were barely moving. By 2am I decided to get my hold luggage and leave. We were told the incorrect information 3 times by United officials with regards to where to collect our bags. I eventually asked a cleaner who kindly took me to the right place. We were also told to collect hotel vouchers from the United attendants at the baggage hall however they denied all knowledge of this and sent us back upstairs. It was a complete shambles. 3am and I eventually lost my temper having already taken 3 flights to get to San Francisco. I was eventually given a hotel voucher. The next day I checked the United app to see whether there was advice with regards to how to refund the flight cost. I discovered that United had booked me on a flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt to Singapore and they had not communicated this to me via email, text or in person. I cancelled the flight and was offered a refund for the original flight cost. I agreed to this and then an error stating the refund could not be processed popped up. I booked another flight with Singapore Air when the United flight was cancelled, and arrived at the airport 2 days after my original flight to discuss my flight refund with United staff in person. I waited for an hour at the United counter whilst employees tried to figure out if they could refund me (one would think this is a regular occurrence). Eventually they told me I have to do it online (even though sometimes they can do it person) as well as claim for all the food I ate while I was stuck in San Francisco and the difference between my original United flight ticket cost and the new Singapore Airlines ticket price (more expensive because of demand and short notice). I claimed online and was told I would not be reimbursed for any of the food costs incurred, or the taxi from airport to the airport hotel, or the difference between the United Airlines flight and the Singapore Air flight. United gave me a refund for the cancelled flight and a United Airlines voucher (which I will clearly never use!) I asked for cash refund instead, they said they ""don't do this"". The service from United was absolutely dreadful. I do not know how any company operates like this but I will never fly United again. This delay has resulted in a multitude of extra costs for me at my next destination including a COVID test which is now 4 times more expensive than my original booking, money lost on a hotel, money to change my onward flight from my next destination. Not to mention how the stress has affected me emotionally.",-1

I do not fly often but this airline makes me want to drive 13 hours rather than flying for 2.5 hours. There was a weather delay on my first flight, 30 min before we were supposed to board the flight was canceled, but this was understandable due to the weather. I spoke to a United Airlines rep and I was put on the earliest flight the following day (12 hours later), I checked my bags in and 30 min before I was about to board a 2nd time, our flight was canceled! I have now been in this airport going on 18 hours and for absolutely no reason at all. I was forced to cancel my ticket because I couldn’t wait here another 9 hours for the next flight to a place 135 miles away from where I need to land. I’m currently waiting in my 20th hour for my bag that I checked in, I’ve talked to 4 different United reps and not one of them gave me the same answer on where my bags where/are!

Even when i explained my job situation, Nobody cared they told me too bad nothing they could do. not even a refund! I'm so disgusted with this customer service and the way these employees handle themselves that i will be cutting my card and not using this service anymore, think twice before booking, They are turning into a spirit airlines.

Today from Arizona to NJ with a stop over in Houston. Was told the flight was delayed for an hour. Then 10 plus hours due to weather which I understand. My hand luggage was checked in at the skyline entrance in Phoenix. I asked for my bag and was told to go figure it out myself that the customer services can't help with that. Told them i need my toiletries as am on my period. The lady could care less. Last year November too from Dallas to NJ my flight was delayed from 2pm to 9 pm. I managed to reschedule to 4pm and was charged extra. Yet the 4.15pm flight was delayed till 5.30 after I paid extra fees. I stopped flying united for international flight in 2017 and only fly local with them. My problem is not with the cancelled flight but the bad customer service. The international air hostesses always act like they are doing you a favor by flying united. Never ever again. This is the last straw. Have learnt my lesson.,-1

When we arrived, that lay over was extended for 2 hours. Then another 1.5 hours. Shortly before midnight they cancelled the flight. Now stranded in DC they gave us no transportation, no hotel voucher, and no sympathy. As I write this review we are in the airport scrambling to find someone to watch our 5 year old son. Our dogs can hopefully be fed by a neighbor. We both had to cancel work for the day. We’ve slept maybe 4 hours in the last 48 as we’re on standby to hopefully get home at some point. Our bags are in NY for some reason. Not a single employee seems to care, or made it at all easy to coordinate a way home.

We were rebooked by United on a Lufthansa flight for the same night, departure to Barcelona via Munich without our consent. We had to pay $75 for our baggage to Lufthansa whereas United was supposed to take care of baggage fee charges. Instead of our direct flight from Newark to Barcelona on United Airlines we were put on a connecting Lufthansa flight to Barcelona via Munich. Too much unnecessary harassment by United.

The boarding was so chaotic it delayed the passengers taking their seats. I had been on 3 flights prior to this one and my regulation carryon bag did not fit in the locker so it had to be checked.

The representatives would go silent on the call or hang up on me, until I got Shelly who was able to help me. 2nd I had to call again because for my trip back home Pasco airport were not able to take my luggage. I paid for the checked bag on line on the app. I called Customer service again, a rep picked up and then was silent and hung up on me. I had to call again. I got a rep who was not able to give me my refund back on the luggage. She states there was a whole other card thats not mine. I told her that I paid with a certain card, which the money did get taken out. I will never fly with United ever again because of the lack of customer service and the lack of consideration of customers that have things planned out for several months that I had to make changes to my flight.",-1
2022-05-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,"Toronto, Canada to San Francisco",1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,2,I feel like they don't really care about their passengers,False,"  Because of the long lines at the TSA checkpoint and the US Customs check pre-flight, we just made our 7 am flight. I upgraded to economy plus, but in hindsight, I should have just kept our normal economy seats. The economy plus gave us extra legroom, but that was it, no other frills. The seats on these planes are so small and short, I felt like I could slip off the seat, not to mention how uncomfortable they are. Also, there were seats open on this flight, maybe 4 empty rows that I noticed. A passenger went to go sit in the empty row, but the crew made him go back and sit in his preassigned seat. He was a big guy and would have been more comfortable in the empty row. Another thing, I was unable to buy food at the airport because of time restraints, so I figured I would just purchase food once I was aboard. Unfortunately, they had no food for purchase on this 5hr 45 min flight. I was surprised. This airplane had an old entertainment system, so it was like watching TV. Whatever was on a channel, you could watch with commercials. United used to be one of the best airlines, but now I feel like they don't really care about their passengers.",-1
2022-05-10,0.3,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Knoxville,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,4.0,2,"The crew was kind, attentive, and concerned",False,"  My 94 year old mother and I were going to visit her son in Tennessee. The morning flight was delayed in Newark, causing us to miss our connection in Chicago to Knoxville. The choice was was wait until 7 pm for non-guaranteed standby or reroute. We were rerouted to Philadelphia (two hours from Mom's home). Thank wheelchair support for getting us there. It's now late afternoon and we haven't eaten since early morning. Of course, there's no food on any flights. Amazingly, the Newark crew was on the Philadelphia flight, recognized the issue and snuck us a snack box. The crew was kind, attentive, and concerned. Finally got Mom to bed about midnight - a 17 hour day. Mom was seriously exhausted. The trip home had the same scenario. We boarded the plane in Knoxville to D.C. but were taken off because the toilet was broken. Rumor had it the repair was signed off as fixed, but the log book was actually falsified. So, rerouted again to Chicago, late afternoon. We did get meal vouchers and the airport had rocking chairs for our 7.5 hour wait. Again, wheelchair support saved us in Chicago. We had a very tight connection. Got Mom home just after midnight for another very long day. We could have gone to Europe and back twice. I should have been collecting magnets or t-shirts.",-1
2022-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Denver,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,by far my worst travel experience,True,"  That was by far my worst travel experience! We were going to Denver and were taking the last flight of the day, we were on the plane, taxing to get ready to take off, but we didn't. we got an announcement from the crew (the crew was the only positive point of this journey, really friendly and trying their best) that we had to wait a little bit because of an engine issue. It turned out that we stayed stuck for 2 hours on the plane! The A/C was off because it was an engine issue, the A/C was off and we were boiling inside the plane! Instead of disembarking everybody after one hour, they kept us there for a little bit more than 2 hours with no air! I'm genuinely surprised nobody fainted! During this time, we didn't get any info and we were told to wait for the Customer Service Coordinator or something like that who never showed up for more than 2 hours!! We finally disembarked but the flight was never canceled so we didn't know what was going on! Nobody saying anything! After around 5 hours, our flight was canceled and we were told that we could take a flight the next morning at 8 am without the need of changing our board pass, and they told us that at least 5 times! Because it was really late, we asked for a hotel voucher but we had to wait at least one hour to get one, which should be way faster, especially when it's already 1 am and you just want somewhere to sleep! We finally got the voucher and we were heading to the hotel, we received a text that our tickets were changed, and now we were taking off at 8:40 am to Portland! We called the customer service to help us because it was really confusing since the crew at the airport told us 5 times that we had a direct flight for Denver at 8 am with the same boarding passes. They told us through the phone that this flight didn't exist and that we were put on a flight to Portland before going to Denver! So we asked if they were any other earlier flights, and there was one at 6:45 am (at this point, it was almost 2 am when we were talking with the customer service) and the customer service person told us that the flight was full and we should go to the airport 2 hours before hoping for a seat!! I was so angry at this point I couldn't take it anymore. Luckily, my partner insisted and we finally got seats on the 6:45 am flight (not seating together but at this point, it didn't matter). So to summarize this nightmare, we got stuck on a plane with no air, with no information, and the help provided was poorly delivered. I honestly will try to avoid United Airlines in the foreseeable future!",-1
2022-05-09,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Los Angeles,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,never use this company again,True,"  The worst airline that I have ever dealt with. I was supposed to fly with my husband form Toronto back to Los Angeles. We arrived at the airport on time but the agents on the express check in machine took our passports and wasted our time trying to check us in on 4 different machines & then he was you are late we can't get you on the flight when he still had 87 minutes before the flight. He told us to go call our company to rebook our tickets, & he pushed us out of the line for regular check in and forced us to go call the customer service. We called customer service when spent 3 hours on hold no help was given to us, they just kept saying there system was down. They did absolutely nothing to help us. When we finally got a supervisor he said the system is not down and kept lying to us. Guess what the flight was delayed for 30 minutes. We will never use this company again. I don't recommend it to anyone.",-1

If I didn't have credit with this airline, I would have never booked this flight. My mother-in-law's flying in from Brazil because my wife is due any day with our second baby. United delayed her flight so she will miss her connecting flight. I had a terrible experience with their customer service and the only thing they can do is to have her connected to a flight in San Francisco same day. It will require me to make a 4 hour round trip. If I had wanted to have her fly into San Francisco, I would have paid more than $500 less for the flight. Agents gave me no empathy and just told me to email their general feedback feature and hope for some compensation. I have never been treated worse by an airline and that's saying a lot since American Airline is also terrible. It's truly incredible what a terrible customer service this airline gives.",-1

First they cancel our flight with no notification whatsoever. Tried calling for help and the people on the phone had no idea the flight was cancelled. Whatever we decide not to make a big deal out of it and try to take the flights they gave us as alternative. Mind you my wife is 3 months pregnant and when the new flights/seats where assigned we weren’t seated together. We only asked if we can be moved together (at least give us that) she is pregnant she gets nauseous, has to use the bathroom quite often , I wanna be close you know? Boy the attitude we got from this person is out of this world. Unwilling to work with us, didn’t care to even try to find a solution, she told us if we don’t like it we can take a morning flight but we have to pay for the hotel and taxi. United you get absolute 0 in customer service and I will never ever fly with you again.",-1
2022-05-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Madison to Omaha,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,canceled my ticket without any notification,False,"  I agree that United Airlines are the worst company I flew. They just automatically canceled my ticket without any notification. I was noticed when I checked in at the airport. The United Airlines staff at the airport never tried to help me. ""It looks like it is canceled. You have to call United Airlines."" Why does it take 30 minutes to mention this? If the woman figured this out quickly, I would fly as it was scheduled by rebooking it. I ended up rebooking and waiting for 6 hours at the airport. Furthermore, I prepaid for my luggage on my round trip. They never know this. Whenever I check in, I have to tell them that I prepaid for my luggage. It was the most terrible flight experience i had in my life. I want to give Zero score.",-1
2022-05-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst company I ever flew,False,"  United Airlines are the worst company I ever flew. I paid for my ticket and didn't get any luggage included on my round trip and I ended up paying 340$ plus. I paid for my seats and it happened the same thing, I had to argue with their employees about my seats to have the one I paid for. The whole trip cost me like 940$ and for what, for nothing! It is not only the price of the ticket but everything else wasn't good enough to justify at least a thing about the trip. The seats were uncomfortable, you have to pay for the headsets in case you want to watch a movie and you don't have a pair, the food was poor. Prepare yourself for an uncomfortable trip.",-1

2022-05-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sao Paolo to Washington,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,3,Never fly United again for sure,True,"  First time to fly United after long divorce (I decided not to fly United again back in 2015) any way I though to give it another try 2022. Flight was supposed to leave São Paulo 9:00 pm, 2 hours before the flight, received email with notification of 2 extra hours of delay, no problem, continue to enjoy the huge São Paulo airport, at 10 pm received another notification of 2nd delay, new time, mid night. After several delays, the flight was canceled completely,  Very stupid feeling when you are in foreign country, waiting over 12 hours, no food, no rest, no nothing. The only thing they were able to do was transfer me to another airline, end of my story? I sent several email to customer service department and if I talked to my dog that many times, my dog would talk back to me, but United closed their customers service complaining department and no more anything,  not even apology. Never fly United again for sure this time.",-1

I suggest people go to another airline. It would be better to pay more than to fly with this no compassion, unorganized and incompetent airline. Canceled our flight and our option was to wait at an airport for 10 hours, transfer to Georgia which is an almost 2 hour flight, wait at that airport for 4 hours then finally get a flight back home. They screw up and they won't even refund so we can just rent a car and drive the 6 hours home. They could care less that we're stranded here and that our 3 kids are home and we had to work hard to find accommodation for our children. I have never seen such horrible customer service. They accommodated by moving us to Delta however when I found a flight that would get us home sooner, I was told she couldn't move our delta flight. Dishonest and disgusting company.

However, on Thursday, April 28, 2022 and Saturday 30, 2022, there was a layover in Chicago. Normally I'm pretty patient but this was a bit outrageous. My original departure time from Chicago was 5:53. It is now 8:53 and we're still here. I explained to one of the attendants what was going on and his response was United do not make non stop flights.

We all booked the same United flight arriving at 11am and carpooling from there to our hotel. Email came out that the outgoing flight had changed now arriving at 3:44pm not 11:00am. Text messages start flying everyone is changing their outgoing flight on a different airline that can get us there in the morning. I follow suit and then go to cancel my United flight. Called Priceline, they said call United. Called United they said call Priceline. United gave me a $60 credit, which i will never use with United, in place of two seats on my outbound flight. My friends? all of them, no problem, full refund and some even saying the they saved $200! Why the double standard? Some canceled before my first call and another canceled after my first call which according to my customer service rep was completely understandable in her opinion. I understand things happen and it's not an easy time for the airline industry. I understand that changes may occur but don't screw it to me as a result. This was not my fault!",-1
2022-04-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to San Jose Mexico via Chicago,2.0,,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,experience this far with United Airlines is awful,True,"  My experience this far with United Airlines is awful, not only they have my first flight delayed because they were understaffed and forced us to miss out connecting flight, then they tried to lie about it calling it weather related but the pilot admitted over the intercoms that it was a maintenance issue and once another passenger helped out telling a supervisor what happens while we were in Chicago connection I made them put us on another airline to get to our destination. We stilled missed almost our entire first day because United could not get us there until almost 9 hours later. They were supposed to give our bags to American Airlines but instead sent out bags on another United flight to Texas where they apparently still sit and nobody from United has helped us but just try to blame other airlines now. Now we are in Cabo with nothing, traveling with my fiancé, my 4 year old daughter, and 10 month old son with nothing, shops have nothing for children and we are not near any shopping. We are at a loss right and miserable on our first vacation together and first in many years. We no diapers clothes other than what was on us from NY cold weather. If we do get out luggage it sounds like it won’t be until we are leaving or not at all. If united has any care for customer service or satisfaction they will own up to this and compensate us for this trip which was already a financial stretch for us. We need help!",-1

Got on a flight to a Florida destination for a long weekend. After a delay due to United airlines at our layover, we decided to cancel our entire anniversary trip. They couldn’t get us to our final destination until days later which ruined our long weekend. There is no point going to the destination for less than half the time. We purchased a return flight out of our own budget and canceled the trip. United staff, customer service in-person, customer phone service and their online help was less than satisfactory. We hate United and this is the 3rd trip they have ruined. No weather, no other issues. No legitimate excuses. No sorry. They just suck and are inconsistent. They take your money and don’t deliver the results. I will avoid all United flights in the future and recommend that to others.",-1

We had a trip this morning to fly to Orlando and it was cancelled so we figured that maybe they’ll comp us an extra day to fly back (since they shortened our trip by a day).

When we boarded they said we had to check our one bag because they no longer had room. Once we got on the plane there were tons of empty upper compartments to hold bags. They were not nice at all and it was ridiculous. If you have rules than you should actually follow them so the people who bring just one bag can actually use their space!,-1

So, please keep in mind, that United only has an 80% on-time rating, which means 1/5 of all flights are either cancelled or delayed - they need to be downgraded to a “Budget” airline and forced to reduce flight fares by 20%, seems fair to me, if you cancel or are late 20% of the time, then why should we pay premium prices? Who gets fired for this? I say get rid of everyone at a manager level and above and start over, at this point they have everything to gain and nothing to lose",-1

2022-04-20,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Calgary via Denver,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,disappointing and frustrating experience,True,"  This is somewhat of a blanket review after years of experience. But, this most recent flight was just confirmation that I need to review United. I was 1K with them for years, but I let that lapse because I felt flying United was a terrible experience given almost 100% of the time I felt like the product, not the customer. In this most recent case, United once again made us late for our arrival to Calgary. Then, we had to wait over an hour to receive our baggage. By that point, the car I hired to drive me to my family 120 minutes away had left given they had other passengers, thus abandoning me in Calgary. Not surprisingly, United refused to help citing that once a passenger arrives at their final location, they no longer have to compensate for poor service. United’s sub-par service on this flight alone cost me over $600 USD to take a taxi to meet my family at one AM. In aggregate, United does a fantastic job of financial damage control by refusing to compensate for their terrible service, thus ensuring a better financial bottom line for share holders, fully accepting the hit to their reputation. If you fly another airline such as Delta and then compare the experiences, sadly the disparity is massive, and United looks even worse. Yet, I now live in Ottawa and to fly to IAD from YOW almost requires a United Flight, which almost guarantees not only a disappointing and frustrating experience, but in many cases an inappropriately costly one.",-1

One side of the building said United premiere access and the other side just said United. Since I am not a premier access member I assumed that I needed to go to the regular United area to check in. A lot of other people also thought the same thing. The lady was rude kept yelling at everybody to go to the other side. If everybody thinks the same thing they should probably change their signage. After checking in the bags we were literally shoot away by the guy. Everybody was rude and demanding and I was very disappointed that the Houston airport treats people this way. We also grabbed a bite to eat and there were big signs saying order here pay here so we did. I tried to send it at a table the lady yelled at us and told us we had to sit at the bar where there was only one chair because that's where we ordered. We only ordered there because there was a big sign that said order there. On the flight was great the flight attendants were amazing. It was disappointing because when we came home from Sedona everyone in the airport was so helpful and friendly. I know customer service does not matter to the Houston airport because people have to travel anyways but it was a very awful experience.,1

Throughout the delay cabin crew laughing and joking in galley .. we were back row. Didn’t care to ask passengers if they needed drink. Return journey. Gate changed 3 times at Miami, resulting in delay and us missing an international connection to London. (Madison was very helpful though in trying to get us off aircraft quickly). Because of delay we had to spend whole night in Newark Airport, no hotel just $30 for food ... 2 hour queue for customer service as only one person at desk and 50 people waiting.

After waiting 45 mins for a chair to the next gate(checked on chair twice), I decided to check the schedule board only to find our flight had been canceled. We were instructed to go to gate C90 but only after waiting another 15 minutes for transport. After waiting in line for over 4.5 hours and 3 customer service phone calls(no help!) I was told we could not fly out until 9pm 4/9/22. While waiting in line we were not offered water or snacks and I was not allowed to keep my companion in a wheelchair with me for conversation and updates. On 4/9/22 we arrived back at the airport approximately 12:30pm and had wheelchair assistance to gate which had changed from our tickets issued us a few hours earlier. In the 8 hours waiting for our flight our gate changed 3 more times, which meant 3 more times waiting for assistance. I would have never known of the gate change except I kept checking the board (worried it was going to get canceled again). Once we arrived in Bangor, Me all of our luggage did arrive with us but my snow globe souvenirs for my granddaughters were broken even though they were packed well and two bottles of alcohol survived. I shudder to think what would of happened to my companion if she was traveling alone. She would be stuck at some gate waiting for transport. I also got no notifications that our flight was canceled which would have been helpful. Phone customer service was no help which I do not understand why. If you can call and book a flight, why can't you call and get assistance with a canceled flight. It would have reduced the long line of waiting, angry passengers. Overall absolutely worst travel experience I have ever had and I would not recommend this airline to anyone.",-1

I was scheduled to fly out of Roanoke on April 10th at 7.00 am. This flight was delayed for five hours which caused several missed connections in Chicago. I ended up having to switch airlines to get to my destination. This resulted in a 19-hour traveling day when I finally go to my destination. Now today, April 15th, I am attempting to return home to Roanoke where my flight is yet again delayed by five hours, however, the plane has still not left to come to pick us up. This is again looking to be an incredibly long traveling day, with the only compensation offered being snacks and water. I understand unexpected issues, however, having two significant delays so close together makes me question the reliability of United and makes me question if I will consider booking with United in the future.

I will be paying more money to fly through another more reliable airline that can meet expectations. First, my return flight was the biggest issue. United Airlines in El Salvador is a disaster. United Airlines ticketing clerk was unprofessional and insubordinate. When asking question the staff ignored finding answers, including when asking him to speak to him supervisor. After insisting on speaking to his supervisor, this staff continued to act unprofessional in disregarding essential aspects. For example, knowing that the flight was delayed he did not bother to look at the connecting flight, when we asked the supervisor about our connecting flight he said that we would surely miss it. The supervisor then issued us a later connecting flight. When we arrived to the United States to board our connecting flight home, this flight too was delayed. We arrived 4 hours delayed from our original purchased flight. United Airlines issued these reasons for the delays ""UA 1953: Your inbound plane is arriving late because of schedule disruptions along its earlier route caused by an out of service aircraft"" and ""UA 339: Your inbound plane is arriving late because of schedule disruptions caused by strong winds and ATC staffing shortages at Newark Liberty International Airport"". I found the ""staffing shortage"" reason interesting.",-1

2022-04-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nairobi to Kansas City via Frankfurt,,,,,,,1,The worst airline ever,True,  The worst airline ever. Cancelled flights for non US citizens through Europe but unwilling to refund as if the inconvenience was not bad enough. It's been three plus months of back and forth between United and Expedia and their ridiculous hold times. I am on hold for an average of 45 mins on every call and still not getting my refund processed. I don't want flight credits because I don't want to do business with them ever again. This is a nightmare. Fly at your own peril.,-1

2022-04-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Norfolk,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,one of the worst flights ever!,False,"  This was one of the worst flights ever! Once the doors were closed, the plane was still somewhat empty. The man next to me asked the attendant if he could switch seats to an empty aisle seat so that we could have more space, and they still wanted to charge him $71! Absurd. They try to squeeze every penny out of you. And if you are basic economy you don’t have the option of using the overhead bins. Never fly with them!",-1

How can that happen? Tried to resolved the day before at check in and was told it would be handled at the airport - it wasn’t! Flight was over booked by 11 people - making it even worse!

Airlines changed my flight without any prior notice from Delhi to Chicago then to Denver and from there to Calgary which caused a trip duration of almost 32 hours. In addition to that, They charged me for my 2nd checked in bag which was originally included in the itinerary. I don’t recommend this airline to anyone.",-1
2022-04-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Bangalore via Newark & Frankfurt,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,hands down the worst airline,False," Columbus to Bangalore via Newark & Frankfurt. Never fly United! It's hands down the worst airline in the US and their customer service and Complaint Resolution Official (CRO) are a joke! In our case United assigned a CRO who had been of zero help and keeps trying to wash their hands off all responsibility that an airline carrier has! We encountered issues in both onward and return international journeys with United. We chose to purchase expensive return tickets with reduced travel time so my family could travel comfortably. BLR to CMH original travel time was scheduled to be ~24 hours, due to cancellations and delays from United the actual time turned out to be ~40 hours! During the return journey, CMH to BLR which was again scheduled to be ~24 hours, again due to cancellations and delays from United this turned out to be ~48 hours! There were two passengers traveling and one was 70 years old and had accessibility needs and United had confirmed wheelchair. Due to reroute they were redirected to SFO and there was no one available to push the wheelchair and another passenger was made to push the wheelchair! Due to all these delays, COVID tests expired and we had to re-do COVID test at Newark airport which costed us another $250. United hasn't reimbursed us to date. They misplaced our baggage which didn't reach CMH for another 3 days. Not only did they not deliver the luggage and we had to go all the way to CMH airport to collect it but they damaged it.",-1

I was on one of the canceled flights on Sunday, April 3rd, 2022 from Cancun to Cleveland. I know this happens. But, the Royal Oasis Resort where we were all given a room is beyond reprehensible. From the cleanliness to the food was totally unacceptable. I had dirty sheets and holes in my towels. Is that somewhere you would put your family? NO. I paid for a nonstop flight and comfort plus seat, I ended up a day later having a lengthy layover in Houston. There really should be compensation for this. Extremely disappointed in United Airlines. I will never refer anyone.",-1

Not only did we notice but others around us did as well, you could tell they hated their jobs and you as the customers were going to suffer the consequences. They spoke in such rudeness! We will never fly with United again.",-1
2022-04-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Austin to Providence via Newark,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Awful service throughout,True,"  Awful service throughout. I paid for a checked bag, and when I dropped it off, was not given a bag tag receipt. I guess this is not usually a huge deal, but of course they lost my suitcase. Flight attendants were straight up rude to each other and passengers on both legs of flight. The first leg of my flight was Austin to Newark. We landed, and the pilot told us that we were behind a few other planes that needed to get to the gate. We ended up sitting on the tarmac in the plane for over an hour, and I had a connecting flight that I barely made. Because of that delay, my bag got left in the original plane and was not transferred over. The flight attendants on the Providence flight were visibly annoyed with me…for the gate delay I did not cause. Once I landed in Providence, I quickly realized that my suitcase did not make it to the destination. I walked upstairs to ticketing to talk to a representative there, and ended up with three people “pitching in” to help me. One lady, who was definitely not there to be helpful but didn’t seem to have anywhere else to go, got after me for not having my baggage tag/receipt. I told her I was not given one, and she repeated that it was my fault. I tried to clarify that I was not given a tag from the person that took my bag, and she raised her voice and began talking over me. It was a full day of paying for the privilege to have United workers bitch at me. After several calls, and begging, and chat messages, I finally found out that my bag arrived at the Providence airport around 930 last night. It was picked up by a courier service just before 10 AM this morning and was supposed to be delivered within 4 to 6 hours, and then the time switched to a delivery of 6 to 8 hours.  United and the businesses it associates with are completely incompetent and unresponsive.",-1
2022-04-06,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Singapore,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,Thank you all UA team!,True,"  I would like to thank everyone at United Airlines for being so accommodating and helpful, especially to the agent at the counter named Raquel. She’s very knowledgeable and very patient with me since I almost gave up because of so many requirements to be filled out and it was my first time ever to go through this very strict and stressful travel due to the pandemic. We had already been dealing with stress from the horrible customer service with Asiana Airlines the day before where they just straight out denied us from boarding because we didn’t have a return ticket, and when I finally purchased our return ticket, they just told me that they’ve closed the check in and that I missed my flight, they didn’t even bother telling me what to do next since I missed my flight. I’m just thankful that after all that we went through, United Airlines agent was there to give us as much information as possible in order to get us to the right direction. Kudos to Ms Raquel at SFO UA counter. Because of her assistance, we were able to fly and now we are in Singapore for our last leg prior to our final destination, Philippines. The aircraft is so nice and clean, the food is delish, the seat is very comfy. The crew is very friendly and informative. Thank you all UA team! I highly recommend you.",1
2022-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to San Jose,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst experience ever,False," Fort Myers to San Jose. I flew with United Airlines about 4 times in 2022. I had the worst experience ever. The flight attendant terrorized me about wearing the mask. She brought a paper with a warning on it and she put my name down. She said that I have to wear a double mask! I tried to sleep during this 10-hour flight but couldn't because of the way they were treating me. The flight attendant put the flashlight in my face to see if the mask was worn correctly. The food was so bad, I could hardly eat. Then, the flight attendant kept telling me that I have to keep my mask between each bite. The service was extremely poor. The seats are so tight, there's no leg room at all. The wifi didn't work at all during the whole length of the flight. I don't want to travel on this airline again.",-1
2022-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,we'll never fly United again,True,"  United turn our family vacation into a living hell! Flew to Miami to board a cruise and they sent our bag to another flight, so we had to wait 3 hours to get our bag. We almost didn't make it in time for the cruise. On our way back to Chicago there was a 3 hour delay. We also had to spend an hour on the plane before we took off. The flight attendant refused to give us a second Biscoff snack because they only allowed one snack per passenger. We had to pay for our kids' food even after the Captain said we were going to get ""free service"" as a token of appreciation for all the ""inconvenience."" We have the United Plus credit card, but we'll never fly United again.",-1
2022-04-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,3,always been a 2+ hour delay,False,"  United Airlines is probably the worst airline I have ever ridden. The past four to five times I have flown with United, theres always been a 2+ hour delay. Is it just my luck with delays? Their seats are awful, I feel like I get sores from sitting on literal plywood for hours. Everything is just bad. The comfort, the food, the timing.",-1
2022-04-01,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Seoul via San Francisco,,,,,,,1,United has the worst customer service,False,"  United has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Uncaring employees that are unhelpful. I have a problem with my flights, and all they can say is ""oh well, you'll have to check in manually"". I can't even use a kiosk to check in - I have to find a special office located in the bowels of the airport to get checked in. This is ridiculous. I've called them numerous times, and told I would get a callback, and it never happens. I've wasted hours of time trying to resolve this issue, and all the CS folks can say is ""tough"".",-1
2022-03-31,0.4,Business,Business Class,Belize City to Rapid City via Denver,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4,United are my least favorite US airline,True," I hate to say it but United are my least favorite US airline. Everything always feels a bit soulless, from booking the flight on the very functional, corporate website and app, to sitting in the rigid seats eating meh food being served by eternally grumpy staff. The only benefit is they are highly competitive on price and hold a lot of routes and airline partners that others don't. The wifi often doesn't work outside the continental US but there's no way to tell the flight path your aircraft will take or how long you have until it cuts out.",-1
2022-03-31,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington Dulles to Newark via Edinburgh,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,5.0,2,The food was barely edible,False,"  We we travelling with a two year old, never an easy task. We waited to be the last ones off when we touched down at Newark to get our connecting flight to Edinburgh. Before we could gather our things, there was a crew of half a dozen cleaners making their way towards us. Worse, the flight crew was then impatiently coming up behind us. A very challenging situation. We are fine not getting extra help, but did not expect such a hindrance. Next leg to Edinburgh was very disappointing. The food was barely edible. They didn't serve beverages for the meal until after the food had been served and they cleared away the dinner faster than one could eat. The red wine was of poor quality. There was one good flight attendant. She saved the day on that flight. Otherwise, the service was brusque and verging on rude. It used to be that airlines used their best attendants for international flights. I guess this is no longer a policy (or perhaps this was there best?!). The seats had almost no cushioning. The inflight entertainment was fine, but the headphones were very bad. I used the personal device option instead so I could use my own headphones. However, every time I paused a movie, when I came back to watch it I had to endure the same awful advertisement before it would continue. Don't advertise to me: I paid for the flight already.",-1
2022-03-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to St. Croix,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,never been so disappointed with an airline,False,"  I traveled on United roughly 1 month ago and have never been so disappointed with an airline. Not only did I arrive at my destination 2 days late because of delays (non-weather related) causing me to miss my connecting flights, but they made a mistake on my departure and only issued 1 ticket while 2 were originally booked. This caused me to depart a day later than planned which resulted in additional expenses for lodging, meals and transportation. I was adamantly assured by the agent on the phone that I would be reimbursed for all of my extra expenses (2 nights unused hotel stay, 1 additional night hotel stay, meals and taxi) for the multitude of mistakes that were made, but United is refusing to do anything other than issue a $300 travel credit. Negligence at it's best.",-1
2022-03-31,0.9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Washington to San Francisco,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,A good flight from beginning to end,True,"  A good flight from beginning to end. Ground services in Dulles were excellent, keeping us well informed and in a friendly manner , even though the departure was delayed a bit. On board the service was friendly, communicative, personable. They seem to have upgraded their AV system with even more choices than ever. I just felt that everyone involved was doing their job and at the best of their abilities and with no hitches.",1
2022-03-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Rochester,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1,You are just a money sign to the company,True," Worst flight experience ever including traveling on military orders! First and foremost the staff are unprofessionally inconsiderate. While most unexpected events come with apologies for United Airlines the lack of training is my biggest reason for the waste of time to leave this review. I hope anyone traveling that cares for customer service reads this. I am currently at the Newark Airport in which I missed my flight perhaps by the seconds of a toilet flush because I unfortunately felt the need to make that call. The original flight out of Houston was delayed due to weather therefore the connection flight had been pushed back to accommodate. This was for no merit as shockingly no announcement was made to accommodate passengers with close connections. All this to say I still somehow made it before the noted departure time to be told rudely by their staff ""yes"" the flight departed as a reply to me asking does the monitor show correctly that this flight has departed. She than continued with an attitude to state we waited for two passengers. I simply just cannot see how to be honest. Despite it being a few minutes still to the noted departure the flight was gone? Her response tone was rude and obnoxious. They plain out just don't care for customer service/satisfaction. You are just a money sign to the company. Staff can care less for the reputation of the airline nor themselves. The seats were tight, flight was full beyond I have ever seen. The new 1st class was roomy for those in desperate need but you should completely forget about the rest! Just a classless business! This is not the time in the world to add to people's mental load! Customer service needs to matter again, please make them accountable.",-1
2022-03-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Green Bay,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1,their service is terrible,True," This was my first experience flying United, normally we fly Delta but my father had some frequent flyer points so we decided to use them on our vacation to Maui. When we got to the airport we boarded the flight a little late and took our seats on the plane. We sat for at least 40 min before the pilot told us that our plane was on fire and we needed to leave the plane. We unboarded and waited about an hour outside the terminal for them to give us a report. They told us that we have no plane to give you, and we needed to leave the terminal so the next flight could arrive on time. We were sent back to where we checked in our bags to retrieve them, and then we waited about 3 hours in a line to get on a bus to our destination. Now normally, things happen, planes combust, 1 instance is fine. It is a pain waiting around, but things happen, and although it took a full day away from our vacation and they refused to pay for our room (or do anything to make up for their plane caring on fire) things could be worse. On our way home, our first flight went as planned with no problem, and I forgot about the fire plane. The next flight was a red eye for us, so I was already irritated enough, but the plane on board software malfunctioned, so we sat for 2 extra hours on the plane before taking off and had to absolutely sprint to our next gate which we had planned to eat at. When we boarded our 3rd and final plane we sat around again for an hour past our estimated departure time, then we were asked to leave the plane again as it had maintenance problems. We will likely take a bus home as well, and I will have spent more time on a bus then on a United flight. The only good thing I can say about this airline is that they are nice, however their service is terrible. On a nine hour flight they came to give me water 1 time and came for trash 1 time. This is absolutely the most unhelpful, worst airline I have ever been on. I hate United.",-1

This staff member commented about us to other passengers saying that “it must have felt like a long flight because of them” and told us that we should give our one year old baby candy to suck on while he was crying at the very end of the flight due to the aircrafts descent.  This was our first and last time flying United.,-1
2022-03-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I had the most stressful experience with United,False,"  I had the most stressful experience with United, and I used to be a long time customer. I made a reservation on their app using my mileage, a week before my trip United decided to cancel my trip, for unknown reasons, without any notification to me. I just happened to check the app and see it gone. I was on the call for 2 hours to get the ticket back and had to call again to make changes. The night before the trip I checked the app and saw my reservation, so I thought I was ok. When I went to the airport the next day, they told me there is no reservation and that I had to call the mileage dept, since they can't do anything. I was on the call, again for 2 hours, with an agent and then a manager, which they did nothing to help my situation and the manager hung up on me. I had to pay $950 on the spot to get a roundtrip ticket. I am extremely disgusted by United and will never fly United ever again.",-1

The employee is trying to sell us on a United Airlines credit card application vs a day charge to utilize the lounge. Poor customer service, especially for business class. Pass on United, trying to make every dime they can on free water and coffee. Service and customer retention starts at the gate, United just doesn’t take care of their business / first class partners.",-1

I flew out of the Pensacola airport and there were only 2 United employees working on staff to help around 50 customers. I had to beg to get a sentence out of the two employees working and eventually missed my opportunity for accommodations due to a delayed flight and had to rebook with a new airline just to get home. I can not blame the employees that were working due to short staff, but the corporation that allows their employee such a large task flow with no help. Absolutely unacceptable.",-1
2022-03-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Charlotte,2.0,,2.0,2.0,,1.0,3,Never again will I fly United,False,  I have been sitting in the Cincinnati airport for seven hours waiting to board. I purchased tickets X 2 months ago and this experience has been a total nightmare! We have been told five stories by different United staff. None of which are true. The staff working the desk are some of the most rude customer service people I have ever dealt with. They have no compassion. They simply don’t care that they don’t have a plane here for us to board. All they can tell us is it will be a few more hours. They don’t offer any compensation. Never again will I fly United.,-1

I get to Houston and after 3 hours they tell me my flight to Kansas is cancelled. I then go and make flights back to Florida. Next morning United texts me and states the original flight is ready and they put me on it so i can make my work summit. ""Now i have paid 1100$ to go back to Florida which I'm now not going there. I filled out the refund which i was then told to go through customer care. ""which not one understands English or can understand a conversation"". So here i am 20 days later waiting for something! No help, no English speaking person calls me or emails.  Never again will I fly this airline, as a matter of fact i was robbed $1100.00 for a flight I did not take.",-1

So basically a 10hr trip turned into 24hrs of travel. United Airlines, Especially Patrick in Chicago Airport jumped through hoops getting us home. They had to make a separate plane ride for 16 passengers that were coming from Hawaii to Kansas City. We actually rode in a plane that is usually used for crew members.",1

They gave us pretzels and I took a pack with me, at my house I ate some and I saw the expiration date and they were expired! The TV didn't work that well.

This is not a 5-10 minutes delay, which is perfectly reasonable, this is a 45 minute to 90 minute delay for as few as a single passenger.",-1
2022-03-18,1.0,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Zurich,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,everything was smooth and enjoyable,False,"  The exception of a little disorganization boarding because of the new COVID/ vaccination rules, everything was smooth and enjoyable. The Polaris lounge was closed (disappointed) and the United club lounge was pretty crowded- although when we checked into the lounge we were given special bags with snacks, water, and drink tickets( I guess for top shelf). Boarding was pretty quick and I loved my seat in true Polaris. The flight crew was extremely friendly upon boarding and through out our flight. Again food service was “modified “ due to COVID, I personally thought my short rib entrée was quite good (though I would call it more like roast beef) as well as my breakfast frittata. There was a snack basket upfront as well. We deplaned in a nice organized manner with each crew member wishing us well. Bags arrived in one peace and quickly. Our return flight was equally enjoyable. I was so happy with United, I booked with them again for our next European adventure on same plane and a quick small vacation domestically. I did not book with points and paid cash( if that makes a difference). I only mention that because it’s a lot of money to spend when you work in a supermarket lol. Looking forward to our next trip with United.",1
2022-03-17,0.9,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Harrisburg to Chicago to San Francisco to Monterey,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,4,flight attendants were all friendly and personable,True," Not going to lie, I was super skeptical with my airline choice after reading these reviews. But now that I flew across the country with 2 connecting flights and a family of 5, I gotta say, I think most of these posts were written by someone who booked a basic ticket. We flew Harrisburg-Chicago-San Francisco-Monterey with regular economy tickets and had only one issue (it was a drunk woman having an anxiety attack at the last connector). We were actually 5-10 minutes early for each landing. Same early landings with our flight back (MRY-LAX-ORD-MDT). The 787 was most comfortable (the 737 was cramped and my neck was stiff after 4+ hr flight). No luggage lost, no luggage damaged, flight attendants were all friendly and personable. Would fly United again.",1

How many rows they eliminated yet again to squeeze more seats? I am average person size 6 and I can fit in in this seat. It is a torture. Unfortunately, they are our main airline our of Houston. Even economy plus is tiny. I guess they only care if you pay for business class. Wifi is barely working as well. We are all treated as numbers for them. New CEO said he is going to make this airline great. Start with making it less terrible first. When passengers have to take Advil to survive the pain after squeezing for hours into tiny space, this is unacceptable. Worst airline ever.",-1
2022-03-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,United Airlines is the new Spirit Airlines,True," Well, where do I start?! I have bought tickets from United Airlines to fly from Chicago (ORD) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL), me, my pregnant wife, my one year old daughter and my brother-in-law. There's no such thing as courtesy boarding for moms, pregnant women, or people that have an obvious need of help. When I checked in, I had chosen middle and window seats on one row and another aisle seat on a different row, the only seats available to be selected in the United app. I ended up for some reason with 2 window seats and one middle seat. We get to the gate (total chaos), I asked a lady from United if I can get seats with my wife on the same row since we have an infant daughter with us and my wife is pregnant...the answer was random and it was given by another guy who jumped into my conversation: we have somebody that already asked for this, we will see what we can do...we boarded and after a while I've asked again a steward about the seat...but I've got another lame excuse, the plane door needs to be fixed. This was the pretext for the delay, United Airlines lied to us about a door issue so they can win more time and fill in empty seats left. We were supposed to take off at 3.55pm, it's 4.40pm and we're still on the ground. United Airlines employees are probably the most frustrated employees I have ever interacted with, from an airline, condescending and rude is all they have to have on their resumes. United Airlines is the new Spirit Airlines a very unfriendly airline for families. I do not recommend! Thank God we're flying back with American!",-1
2022-03-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst experience of my life,True,"  Booked my trip back in December 2021. One month before our travel plans I received a message saying our departing aircraft was returning to Boston a full day later than we had booked for. Our 4 hour flight was now turning into an overnighter and 14 hour trip with 3 connecting airplanes to catch. I had hotel and car reservations that I was paying for in Boston for the day we had planned for. I lost almost $1000 on these plans alone. I contacted United and spoke with a very nice woman who helped me use their customer service tool to request reimbursement for my ""significantly changed flight"". I was reimbursed my trip at the assurance that I was still booked for the flight (I asked the woman about this several times throughout our conversation). She assured me that because United could not book me on another flight because there were none scheduled, I was entitled to my money back for my flight because of significant unavoidable changes to our trip. After checking one final time that I was still in fact booked for my flight, we hung up and I received my refund a few weeks later. Fast forward to the last day of our trip. I call United because I did not see a check in option for my flight and now my confirmation code won't work. Come to find out the United representative cancelled my reservation and I was without a flight and stuck in Utah. I gave this agent everything I had: case numbers from customer service, the name of the original agent I spoke with, dates, emails and she did not care to acknowledge any of it. She said ""I am sorry the agent gave you false information but you must buy your ticket for tomorrow on this flight at current market value"". Not only was my flight canceled on me, they charged me $900 dollars for a flight I originally purchased at $400. I informed the woman that on their website it says that United will reimburse for ""significant travel delays"". The original agent I spoke with quoted a delay of 6 hours as a significant delay which mine ended up being 14 hours by the time all was said and done. This United supervisor did not care to hear any of it and several times in our conversation just stopped answering me. All she had to say is that United doesn't reimburse a flight if you still get on the flight, which is a complete lie. United's website WILL reimburse for travel delays while also allowing you to take the flight. So in all United cost me almost $2000 dollars in flights and missed rental and hotel reservations. If they weren't the only airline that flew out of the tiny town we were staying in, I would have rebooted with another airline. Absolute worst experience of my life I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.",-1
2022-03-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tucson to Boise via San Francisco,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,such an awful airline,True,  United airlines is such an awful airline. It is 100 percent guaranteed to have a delay or cancellation at some point in your trip. I have taken 8 flights with them in the last 6mo with 100 percent of them either delayed or cancelled leaving me and hundreds of other people stranded. They also also keep playing these loud sales messages for credit cards and these long COVID messages. At least 15 total minutes of these blaring obnoxious messages. I am terrified now when United is the only airline that has what i need. I notoriously wait till the last second to buy my flights but the prospect of having to fly United ever again in the future is enough to make me plan ahead.,-1

During the check in, after I checked in my bag, I got a different seat in the airplane. I don't know what's the point of selection the seats during buying the ticket if all the seats selection mixed up then. When I was on board I wanted to exchange the seats with one of the passenger, who did not mind us to exchange the seats. However, a crew attended insisted that I remain on the seat provided in the board pass after check in. I don't know why she cared why I occupied exactly that seat if we exchange the seat with another passenger. The aircraft alignment stays the same. Bad experience.",-1

I’ve waited over hours on customer service. Now Let me start by saying every flight I’ve had from them since Wednesday to Sunday has been delayed, no reimbursement or compensation for multiple delays due to service failure and I experienced the worst customer service from one of their employees who was one of the most unprofessional, brash, condescending and rude people I've ever met. Being a disabled veteran to fly is already challenging but to be met with rudeness and unprofessionalism from the person who was meant to assist you is heart breaking, I will never fly with this airline again.",-1

This is quite possibly the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my 79 years of life. Absolutely astounding! I have tried their website with no success, then on to their chat which was a complete waste of time, and now I am on hold for a ""supervisor"" I eventually had to hang up as nobody had the decency nor courtesy of picking up the phone.

I encountered delays for each flight in addition to no available online customer service and a wait time of 1 hour - 2 hours for in person service. Every single flight had a seemingly trivial error which caused delays (not able to fit baggage, not enough fuel for plane, misaligned ramp). The United website tried booking flights from wrong locations in response to delays which further complicated the rebooking process. Inflight service was awful with contentious and rude hostesses. Overall terrible experience and recommend to avoid United at all costs.",-1
2022-03-13,0.1,Business,First Class,Denver to Boston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,was extremely rude to myself,True,  The agent at gate B31 and her colleague (who walked away from me rudely when I asked a question was extremely rude to myself and another gentlemen in front of me. We stood there for at least ten minutes without being acknowledged and then when I did say excuse me the lady who wouldn’t give me her name was very rude to myself and the gentleman standing next to me who had been waiting longer than myself. All I wanted to know was if my plane was delayed and your employees working acted as if I was bothering them while they are supposed to be doing their job. I was extremely surprised as to the attitude that I received when inquiring about my flight with United. Please train your employees to at least try to accommodate your guests flying who pay good money to do so. If I could have rates United with a 0 out of ten I would have. Thanks.,-1
2022-03-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,West Palm Beach to Portland via Newark,3.0,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,I will not fly United Airlines again,True,"  Bad from the start. As soon as my mother and I checked our bags the agent told us there was an issue with the flight. I asked her what she meant and she told me that there was a delay, but we would still make our connecting flight. Which I feel she knew quite well that we would not. There was an hour delay, then the boarding process took forever, people from later groups cutting in front of the current group, it took forever to leave the runway, then we had to wait to land until there was a gate available, we kept circling the airport. By the time we landed in Newark, NJ our flight had already departed. There was no one at our gate to help us, we had to search the airport to find customer service. There was a LONG line once we reached it, with only 2 agents available. It was painfully slow. They kept telling us to use the QR code and/ or the kiosk, but we needed to speak with someone so continued to wait. A woman cut in front of the entire line and the female agent helped her anyway. The line was frustrated and angry and a man went up and told the agent that the woman had cut in front of everyone and that it wasn't fair and she needed to wait in line like everyone else. She continued to help her anyways, then left and went to go get another agent and they both continued to help this woman and make the rest of us wait. It was at least another 20 minutes of them helping her as though she was more important than the rest of us. It was unfair and frustrating to us all. We were in line for an hour or so before we finally made it to the front of the line. Hours later saw the same woman who had cut in front of the line sitting at her gate so obviously she wasn't in dire need of immediate help. 6 hours later we finally were able to get a flight. All of this could have been avoided if the agent who had checked our bags had found us an alternate flight instead of putting us on a plane that more than likely wasn't going to make it in time for our connecting flight. I will not fly United Airlines again. I had a very similar terrible experience when it was just Continental airlines about 10 years ago. My small children and I ended up having to spend the night in Newark at the airport. It was a nightmare! Apparently although they had merged with United it's still just as lousy the two airlines being combined. Back then they didn't have covid or staff shortage as an excuse.",-1

On sitting I was 1/4 off my seat. The person had put the middle arm rest up she took over 1 and a half of the 2 seats. I asked if I could sit somewhere else but it was completely full. Finally a slim gal across from me said she would switch. The person kept remarking she was big boned etc - she was obese. Why should I have to be half off my seat while she is taking up half of where I should have been sitting? The trip was 1 hr 45min.,-1
2022-03-11,0.1,Business,Business Class,FRA to ORD,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,turned away at the Polaris Lounge,False,"  Horrible United and Star Alliance Experience. UA 8836, operated by Lufthansa, on March 9th from FRA to ORD was delayed over 3 hours because the first aircraft's cabin air system was inop. The 3-hour delay was communicated in 20-minute increments which keep the hope alive that I would make my ORD-SNA connection, for over 3 hours. What it also did was eliminate the ability to rebook on other flights that were available at the same airport. In the end, I was left with no other choice but to stay on UA 8836. Once we were airborne I was told that the estimated land time was the same as the departure time for the ORD-SNA leg, thus, most likely I would be rebooked. Prior to landing all connecting passengers were told that there would be agents waiting for us at the arrival gate to provide our new connecting information. There was no service. There was a lady yelling out, ""for your connection, check the monitors"". Not very helpful since my connection was already taxiing. With no one providing any guidance, after exiting customs, I followed a Lufthansa standing banner to the AA baggage recheck area was told that United is on the other side. I recommend you move the United and Lufthansa signs to the hallway where United counter is and make it visible for passengers coming out of the door. At the United counter at baggage recheck, I found out that no seats were available in the cabin that was purchased. I asked for an exit row seat, and was glad that a window seat was available. Still hopeful, I headed to the Polaris Lounge, looking forward to a nice shower and some relaxation for my extra 3 hours. However, it wasn't meant to be. Even though I was on UA 8836 operated by Lufthansa, I was told that I cannot get into the Polaris Lounge. I explained my situation to Corey, but he stated that he does not make the policy. Turned away, not feeling happy about the entire trip which started with a 2+ hour delay on UA 960 (EWR-FRA, on March 3rd, had to taxi back to the gate to offload passengers and bags); more delays on LH 636 (RUH-FRA, the delay actually allowed me to make this flight); 3+ hour delay on UA 8836 and only having pretzels for between meal snacks; turned away at the Polaris Lounge; and, worst of all, missing my children's performance which I would've made if I had gotten on my original flight plan; I was left to contemplate my relationship with United.",-1

For a Gold member I expected much better. I was disrespected and dismissed every step along the way. Cancelled flights, delayed flights, missed connections, last minute seat assignment to Economy middle seat (while having paid for a Plus window seat), lost luggage. And on all that, being treated like I did something wrong and I should be happy with what I was offered.

Our airplane had mechanical issues and was delayed over 4 hours. We missed our connection and had to stay the night and are flying out tomorrow. Through the entire process the airport staff was completely sub-par. Don’t appear to know what's going on, how to be friendly or efficient at their job. Very frustrating and unprofessional. We later discovered the exact flight had been canceled for the same reason on each of the 2 previous days. Never ever again will I fly united if I can help it. Also, they put us at a hotel 20 min from the airport. We’ve encountered one inconvenience after another. United doesn’t seem to care about their customers.",-1

For tickets which are $13,000 Round Trip, they don't offer even a vegetarian meal in the Business Polaris section for 15 hour flights. And several of my colleagues traveling with me who are from India who are vegetarian by birth and by religion have to go hungry. When reached Customer service, they don't help, interrupt and when request to transfer to Customer care, the customer care reps don't want to speak or keep interrupting or give standard answers of going to website. In flight amenities of business class keep going down, and the customer service keeps getting worse. They exploit passengers.",-1

The Economy Plus section has enough legroom that I was quite comfortable through the long flight (I am 6 ft tall) and the cabin service was quite attentive and helpful. The IFE worked quite well and had a good selection of content to keep me entertained in between naps. However it was not all good. After paying over a 100 dollars and blocking a aisle seat in advance, I was quite irritated to find that I was relegated to a window seat and said I had to deal with it since it was a full flight. The first meal was adequate if not great but for a 15 hour flight, the second meal was a small snack which was quite inadequate for such a long flight, thankfully I had come prepared for worse with some snacks of my own but without them i would have been quite miserable.",1

2022-03-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,the refund was denied,False,"  I didn't actually fly with the airline. The review is over how they handled my refund request. I purchased a ticket, and two days later I needed to request a refund. I wanted to request the refund before cancellation, in case the refund was denied I could still use this ticket even though it wasn't ideal, but I was told that I had to cancel the flight before I could *request* a refund, so I did that. Then the refund was denied, and now I no longer had a ticket. So now I'm out $700 for a ticket that I don't have, United Airlines gets to sell my seat to somebody else and pocket both our fares, and they leave me with a customer credit that will expire before I have an opportunity to use it. When I called customer service about the issue, they refused to work with me on the issue, instead condescendingly explaining to me that this was my error because it is their company's policy. I have never known a company to operate with such a lack of ethics in my life.",-1

2022-03-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hawaii to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly with United again,True," I only gave them a 1 because I had no choice. Well, after having to spend the night at the airport in San Francisco on a small ottoman in the middle of the airport, due to United booking their connecting flights so close together, that it’s already no way to make it. So if your already non connecting flight is delayed the dominos effect is unstoppable. But since it was so many of us in the same situation, we all were told by several people that the plane will wait on us (almost 30 people), even by the flight attendant before we got off the plane. Knowing we were pushing for time, there wasn’t even a guide to assist guiding in the plane. That was not the case so we all got to spend the night in the cold unsecured airport unexpectedly at 1am and had a 5 hour layover. Plus when we got there the flight assistance didn’t even know we needed the layover. Only thing they offer was a stay at the hotel which we would have to catch a flight the next evening and a bottle of water and food vouchers to places that was closed and wasn’t going to be opened until boarding time. Beyond disappointed. I will never fly with United again and will not recommend them and will discourage anybody thinking about flying with them.",-1
2022-03-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Syracuse to Denver via Sacramento,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,Always count on United to delay flights!,False,"  I arrive at Syracuse airport knowing my flight will be delayed, it continues to gradually get delayed within the next 20 minutes, and the by time my flight to Denver got in I would miss my flight to Sacramento. Luckily, they had a later flight out of Denver to Sacramento. Once seated on my already delayed flight from Syracuse to Denver, we were told there was maintenance issues, and heard very little from the captain and saw nothing of the flight attendants. We waited on the ground for almost an hour and a half, with no flight attendants coming around asking if we wanted anything to eat or drink during that time. I was on track to miss my connection flight again, which would mean spending the night in the Denver airport since that was the last flight they had to Sacramento until that morning. A very nice flight attendant helped me when I asked her, as I was anxious about missing my flight from Denver to Sacramento. She informed me that the flight had in fact been delayed until 9.45, but couldn’t give me any certainty that I would make the flight. My flight got into Denver at 9.20, and I sprinted over to my gate, not knowing if I would make the boarding time. I show up to the gate only to see that the flight had been delayed another hour. Always count on United to delay flights! I guess it worked out because I was able to get on this flight. Their wifi system isn’t great, I prefer JetBlue’s. Once my flight arrived in Sacramento, I went down to baggage claim only to find it wasn’t there, when I walked up to the desk I was met with a rude woman who just told me my bag was still in Denver and would have to come get it tomorrow. No apologies for the inconvenience, no time frame of when to pick up my luggage. After I got to where I am staying, I called customer service, so I could find out more information about my bag, and I was told that I was supposed to fill out a form to have my bag delivered to my location. The woman at the baggage claim desk was no help, rude, and misleading information. I am also confused as to how my bag got stuck in Denver, which I got no clarification on. Its been a long day.",-1

2022-03-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Dublin via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they have no clue what they’re doing,True,"  United is the most unorganized airline in existence, the way they handled all of our delays was catastrophic and caused unnecessary stress to many, many travelers. It started as we checked our bags, after receiving our baggage tags, I noticed they all had different names on them and none of them were us! They had no idea they were sending our bags to different locations! How does that happen when they check you in with your id’s! After pointing that out to the rep, she had to redo everything and recall our bags. Once we finally get on the plane, we are notified that a “glitch” in the system had sold too many seats and they were working it out to get a family of 5 on board. This process took over an hour and 20 minutes resulting in the captain leaving the plane to find out what was going on. Because of this delay in leaving, half the plane missed their connecting flights including us and there we’re no other flights available that night. We went to find a United customer rep to see what our options are and guess what? Not a single United employee at any of the counters with tons of stranded travelers! Unbelievable! We finally used the app to book a hotel and went to get our bags and they don’t have them! Now we’re stuck in Houston, no bags and no flights until noon the next day and all because the crew in Midland had us waiting for well over an hour for one family and the result was stranding multiple families, it made zero sense. After staying in Houston at a run down hotel, we made it back to the airport, ready to finally get on our way. We boarded our new plane along with a hundred other travelers. We had all just sat down and got situated when they announced, you guessed it, we’re delayed and everyone needs to deplane and remove all carry one. After deplaning everyone, they then announced we could be leaving in 20 minutes or so, then why did we all just get off? I am typing this as I sit here waiting on the latest catastrophe from this airline if you can call it that to see what to do next with my family. United has failed at every level on this trip, delaying flights for a single family while displacing many, many more, trying to send our bags to other locations under other peoples names and completely boarding planes just to deplane and then board again. I will never, ever fly this airline again, they have no clue what they’re doing and seem to make illogical decisions that negatively affect their passengers without consideration of future events.",-1

My husband and I flew with our 10 month old son and he was very hyper. Our flight attendant was a blessing and very attentive. She found another seat for the passenger next to me so she didn't have to be bothered by our young son and we could stretch out. She also made a glove balloon for our son for entertainment. At the end of our flight another male attendant gave our son a souvenir wings and booklet. Overall they made the flight more comfortable for us.,1
2022-03-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Williston via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,I will never fly united again,True,"  Stuck in Denver for almost 24 hours because you wanted to book tight layovers and let flights leave early knowing you were still waiting on passengers. Then you “did me a favor” with a hotel and refused to send me to a town nearby when I had an elderly dog who needed his medication and had been away from family for 2 weeks on a corporate trip. Then, you charged me twice for my sick dog who is on his last leg and had to endure insane amounts of stress because of your mistakes. Obviously anyone who had been through this would be incredibly upset. Instead of handling it appropriately, your “customer service” threatens to close the plane and keep me from getting home to my other dog who’s sitter had left the day before. Not only does your “customer service” abuse their power, they have no social skills to handle stress appropriately. Although this was a corporate trip, I will never fly united again. I would genuinely rather make 24 hours drives back and forth to where I need to go before flying with United ever again",-1

2022-03-05,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Moline to Portland via Denver,1.0,,4.0,,,3.0,2,very poor customer service,True,  Flight delayed from Moline to Denver. Missed connecting flight so United changed our seats on the rebooked flight to 10 rows back (original seats Row 15 and we paid extra for these seats) and also split my husband and I up in different rows (mind you we are taking our honeymoon). We tried to change our seats on the app because there were seats together they could have picked for us but we could not do this functionality for a rebooked flight on the app. So as soon as we got to Denver we asked an attendant to help us with our seats (he was just chatting away talking to his buddies) and said he could not help us we had to use a kiosk or wait 1 hour before boarding. Went to kiosk was going to be 85.00 a piece to Change seat. Then went 1.15 hour prior to boarding and the attendant said she’d be right back and it was 35 mins. She never came back. So we grabbed food. Went back before boarding began. No attendant at the desk. So we waited. It was the same agent again. We asked her to help us. Told her the above mentioned situation. She was rude and rolling her eyes. Called for a manager to come. Manager never came until boarding group 4. My husband stayed behind to speak with manager to at least get a refund on our seats we paid for. I boarded because I did not want to miss the overhead space (luggage was lost the last time we flew). A sweet lady who heard the story said she also was rebooked and got sat in a different row than her partner. So we switched places and another lady helped us out. We did get a refund for our seats. But moral of this is very poor customer service and no one wanted to do their job or do their job with compassion and a smile. If the United attendants had been professional I would have not written this. Unfortunately this airline is not what it used to be. Maybe this post will help them in the future.,-1
2022-03-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Redding to Puerto Vallarta,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I would never fly with United again,False,"  Absolutely the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced! Flight was canceled by this airline last minute, and no help trying to get rescheduled. The flight we did manage to get they told us they had no potable water so we would have to use handy wipes! Trying to get a refund the customer service agent told me we used the ticket and there was no refund. So almost two hours later on hold the supervisor said to go back on line and try to fill out the paperwork! I refused and told her it wasn’t working and insisted she stay on the line to help me, guess what? It didn’t work for her either! I have to say I would never fly with United again, and highly recommend reading reviews before using this airline! You pay premium price for your checked luggage also.",-1
2022-03-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Denver to Newark via New Delhi,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,2,I am beyond disappointed,False,"  This was by far the worst experience I've had with an airline. At check in for our international flight (booked 3 months prior for 2 people), the customer service agent canceled our tickets instead of checking our bags on a flight that was still flying (and still flew) after she said it would not be flying. Another rep even tried telling her we were right and she ignored her too! We were paying attention to every change to the schedule, but she insisted she was right and blew us off repeatedly. After our persistence, it took 2 supervisors and another representative over an hour to acknowledge and fix this incredible mistake and they had to book us a different route since our flight somehow no longer had any seats available! We ended up not being able to sit together and remained 3 hours behind the original schedule. This was my first international flight and I am beyond disappointed. I will never fly with United again and will not be recommending the to anyone for any flights.",-1
2022-03-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Montréal,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst traumatizing travel experience,True,"  This has been the worst traumatizing travel experience. It all started at checkin. I wanted to register my suitcase but the system didn’t let me. So I asked for help but employees talking together, not looking at you or going to help other people. Tried to get help they said no more customer service. Tried again to talk to the workers (which are on the phone or talking together) so every time you talk to someone you feel like you are not welcome … then they said to fill out a form on my phone but my phone froze and I couldn’t do anything. I asked and they said no phone working you don’t get in we’re sorry we can’t help. Basically if you have no phone on you it’s impossible to check in your luggage. 1h30 h later I could enter and checkin my luggage (luckily I was 4 hours early)! While walking I realize I have no seat number assigned and I used a travel agent. So I go to my gate and ask for help. The guy cannot help me he says he’s boarding another flight. So I’m asking when can I come back I asked 3 times he always answered the same thing boarding another flight, so I ask where can I get help ? He said nowhere I’m sorry United has cancelled all customer service. While everyone is finally boarding my flight the girl asks for everyone who’s travel ready to come and my ticked said travel ready. So I went and she starts yelling and tell me to go away so I try to talk to her but she just gets crazy. Everyone trying to talk to her she doesn’t answer their question and starts to power trip and yell at everyone. While she was yelling at old people I asked her if she could be polite and talk to people properly, she flipped. So I sat down and let every single person get in the plane. Once I was the only one left both of them were not even looking at me. I asked to please have a seat. She reprinted my boarding pass (was very painful experience) and give me a seat that already has someone in. So I tell her this seat isn’t working there is someone in it already. She goes in the plane upgrades the person on my seat and while I filmed her she flipped even more. So I get to my seat the pilot starts to tell me what’s your problem do you have any problem? So I said no and try to explain the situation and said ok, you’re off I’m kicking you out. A man in front of me trying to defend me got threatened to be expelled from the plane so everyone sat down and they just decided to kick me out of the plane. I am completely traumatized by this airline and the people working there.",-1

2022-02-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Washington to Colorado via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,What happened to the customer service in the United States,True," United Airlines has been horrible with over booking! We paid extra for economy plus and reserved our seats but a few weeks before when they send updates they had switched seats! They left my seat and my 16 year old together and they didn’t have a seat assigned to my 13 year old! When I called them they say the airline is booked and they can’t change the seats for some of the flights and we have to see the attendant at boarding. Also at one of our connections they had all of us in different seats. Not only was their service horrible, there is always delays and a few times cancelations for that past two years when we have been flying! Now they just changed the seats you had reserved months before and separate your kids. What happened to the customer service in the United States. Also on this flight from LA they are doing the same things again. They have moved my 13 year old to 29 rows back at a window seat. This is not acceptable, if I wanted him to travel alone I would have booked him a separate flight by himself. After asking and going back and forth for so long they moved us to the back row where my son was placed instead of the economy plus seats we had picked at the beginning. Better than my son eating by himself but that is ridiculous. Airlines should not be allowed to switch them! We paid for 3 economy plus seats and this way they are forcing us to sit in a regular economy.",-1

Not only that but flights are always delayed. I travel often and mostly use United because of their flight schedule, but what is the point if flights are always delayed, it became a normal thing from United plus their prices are not great either, they should definitely fix the problem as they have competition.",-1

On a clear day we were delayed an hour when they told us the plane was already at the airport and wasn't a late flight in. We finally leave and land and the guy beside me on the 1st flight missed his 2nd flight but I was still ok. I stop and get some food and go to my gate, we load on time and everyone is on the plane and then there comes an announcement that we are waiting on the pilots. I'm like really, the whole crew is here and we are waiting on the pilots. Now we are still sitting here on the plane even later than the already late time for this flight. 23 minutes past the takeoff time that was already an hour late from the original flight time.",-1

Happened in December 2021 with flight delayed over 4 hours and again in February 2022 with delay to Richmond over 4 hours.

2022-02-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston,3.0,,3.0,3.0,,3.0,3,not as friendly as other UA flights,True,"  This is the last leg of trip home from Hawaii vacation with hubby. Flight UA 2361 LAX-IAH on Wednesday 02/16/22 was using N14115, a 26 years old B752. Boarding was done by zone and during boarding there was announcement that backpacks and smaller items need to be put under the seat in front, since this is a full flight and need to fit all carryon bags first in the overhead bins before putting smaller items there. The announcement was repeated several more times but still there were people who had to stow their carryon away from their seats since the space was limited. The overhead bins are the older version that is smaller than most newer planes and can only accommodate smaller sized carryon. Throughout the flight the FA also announced repeatedly about the Federal mask mandate and passengers need to wear masks that fully covered mouth and nose at all times including when talking to FAs to give drink order. Looks like there are routes where this is considered something that need to be addressed repeatedly throughout the flight to the passengers to make them comply. We didn't have the same announcements in our flights to Hawaii and between HNL and LAX. Perhaps this is a reason why the FAs working this flight seems to be a little tense and not as friendly as in the other UA flights we took in the last few days. Sanitizing wipes were distributed during boarding and we used it to clean the screen, seats, armrests and tray tables. This B752 have older IFE system but already have the touch screen with video on demand that is still good for this short 2:45 hours flight. The screen is showing its age and not as bright as it was supposed to be. The single jack for headphones is in the armrest. There was also power port underneath the seat, two for each rows of three seats. The flight was quite uneventful. We left around 5-10 minutes behind schedule but we arrived 25 minutes early.",1

Flight UA 534 used N2142U, a 4 years old 777-300ER. The boarding gate D-1 that was used at HNL can barely accommodate all passengers of this full flight, and the room was packed with many people have to stand since all chairs were occupied. Boarding was done quite orderly by groups. Hand sanitizer wipes were given at the gate. All FAs are on the older side but they were all very nice, cheerful and chatty with the passengers. During the departure announcement they mentioned that all cabin crew are Honolulu based. That's why they were all very cheerful and helpful with positive attitude! This is a redeye flight but the FAs still did two drink runs and an hour before we land a FA even go around offering cups of water and orange juice for passengers who were already awake. The cheerful and hard working FA on this flight who wants to take good care of the passengers really makes the difference to the trip, and this is a nice closure to our Hawaii vacation.",1

However, thanks to Rafael Otero, 5/2026 at the United Airlines counter in Mexico, we all made it home safely. Rather than simply helping the two clients who stepped up to his both, he helped our entire group. When we tried to give him a tip, he wouldn’t accept it. He was so nice! And after helping all the folks in our group, he helped me change my seat. I’m so happy to be home. Thank you so much Rafael Otero! We appreciate you!",1
2022-02-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Honolulu,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3,a nice relaxing flight,True,"  This is a second leg of trip to Hawaii with hubby on February 10th, 2022, flight UA 300 SFO-HNL. The airplane is a 777-300ER (N2341U) which is only 4 years old. Boarding was chaotic. Apparently United was able to help to verify the Hawaiian requirements of vaccination online through their call center and everyone in the boarding area was trying to get it done last minute. We were lucky we were helped by agents at the United Club that we visit and get it done way before we went to the boarding gate. Once your vaccination requirements are verified, United give you a wristband and with that wristband when you arrive in Hawaii you can skip the Hawaiian vaccination verification process and go directly to baggage claim. The chaos made us late by around half an hour; but we got to Honolulu around 10 minutes early. The FAs are mostly older folks; but they were all very nice and cheerful. When we got on board we were given sanitizing wipes that we can use to clean the seat, screen and tray tables. Drink cart made its way around 1 hour after take off. We purchased the United burger from the snack cart; it was really good and tasty. Drink cart made a second round around 2 hours later; the crew were doing a good job of keeping us all hydrated throughout the trip. The crew is more cheerful than the flight from IAH to SFO; perhaps because they're going to Hawaii as well? This is a nice relaxing flight to start our vacation supported by the FA's good service and cheerful disposition.",1
2022-02-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to San Francisco,4.0,,3.0,4.0,,3.0,3,"All in all, just a regular flight",True,"  This is the first leg of a Hawaiian vacation trip with hubby on Thursday 02/10/22. Check-in was done online a day prior, and we were asked to provide proof of vaccination as required at the final destination (HNL). It's great that UA provided the feature online so there is clarity on the requirement to fly to the destination. Bag tagging was quick and easy, and we used TSA Pre that saves time to go through security, and had time to relax at United Lounge. Flight UA1555 IAH-SFO was using a B789 (N19986) that is only 1.5 years old. The seats have enough legroom for us to put our backpacks under the seats in front of us and doesn't feel cramped at all. The seat pan slides forward slightly when the seat was reclined. All amenities works very well, touch screen quite responsive, and we were able to connect our wireless transmitters to the entertainment system to use our bluetooth headphones. Noticed that the FA no longer offers headphones and only provide them based on request. The flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes ahead of time. Drink service was average followed by the snack for purchase cart, but the FA have to be reminded that we pre-ordered snack boxes before we can get them. Looks like preorder was not a norm here. FAs are nice but not as friendly and just going through their expected pace throughout the flight. All in all, just a regular flight, nothing to write home about.",1
2022-02-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Greenville,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolute terrible experience,True,"  My family and I flew from SC to Denver in February 2022. Within the first 10 minutes of boarding the fist plane, all the power on the plane went out. This lasted 10 minutes before we were informed that they were ""rebooting"" the plane's electrical system. Once fixed, we sat on the tarmac for another 20 minutes because they had to change out the sewer water. So flight was delayed 45 minutes before taking off. On our return flight from Denver to SC, we were supposed to connect in Houston. Our flight from Denver did not take off until 40 minutes after our original departure time. When asked why the delay, we were told there were no specific issues, but they were just waiting on a few late passengers to board! I understand waiting a few minutes for late passengers, but waiting 30 minutes after our scheduled departure time is unacceptable. Once we arrived in Houston, we sat on the tarmac for 25 minutes before we could park at the gate, so more than half of the passengers on this flight missed our next flights. My wife, my 3 kids, and I went to the United Airlines desk to ask for help and there were 4 United attendants working at this desk. I explained that we missed our connecting flight and I asked for assistance to find another option. They rudely told me they can't assist me and told me to call a 1-800 number to speak to someone. I called the 1-800 number and was told that United rebooked our flights for a day later and had us going to Chicago, without my input or consent. I asked for help to explore other flight options to SC and the person told me ""sir, you are not listening to what I am saying"". This person was incredibly rude and was extremely unhelpful. I rebooked our flight myself without any help or support from United. We had to spend the night in Houston and fly to Charlotte the next afternoon. The plane from Houston to Charlotte did not have running water in the bathroom and the air conditioning went out once we took off. This flight was 19 minutes delayed, no water to wash hands in restroom, and we flew for 2.5 hours without air conditioning. After landing in Charlotte, we then had to rent a car (with no support from United) at my expense to get home. Flying with United has been an absolute terrible experience and my family & I will never consider flying with United again.",-1

The flight was cancelled due to plane mechanical issues and the soonest they could re-book was two days later with a 15 hour day of flying from Key West, Newark, Denver, to Tucson. At the time of cancelation they said normally they provide a room however in Key West they could not and provided me a link to discounted rooms to book. The cheapest hotel I could book was $581.18. I submitted receipts for reimbursement only to find out that they have a $200 cap on reimbursements for hotels per person. They also provided $10 meal vouchers for each meal. Near the hotel was nothing you could feed yourself for anything close to $10. This didn't even put a dent in the expenses of staying two additional days.

We regularly booked and paid the tickets on their website. At the United counter at the airport, we have discovered that the tickets ""had no value"", as if we did not paid them, even if we had. We tried to call the customer service. All lines were busy and we waited for hours. Eventually, somebody responded, but they were speaking poor English, they did not understand our problem, and they were unable to help us. Overall, it was a shame. We lost our tickets and money. We had to book another flight with them (sadly they were the only company offering a flight that day), and the flying experience was also terrible. Very old and uncomfortable seats, no food, constant advertisement for their products (worse than a low-cost company). You could not even choose when to watch a movie, but you needed to wait for it to start. Overall, this was a nightmare and eventually we just wanted to get rid of them. I would never recommend anybody to fly with them.",-1

This was my first time to ever fly United airlines, and they lost my luggage! I spent my entire trip without my necessities. Simple things like sandals, shampoo, makeup, deodorant etc are really expensive in the Bahamas. I did without most of it and used what was given in the hotel, but some of it we had to have. I did not prepare for extra expenses. We stayed at an all inclusive resort, and we’re staying for such a short time. The resort we stayed at tried to help make things better and offered another night at a discount, (they were awesome, they did nothing wrong and we’re still trying to make our experience better) after finally receiving our luggage right before departing the island! But we couldn’t get a hold of United to change dates without being penalized $400.  I went through proper steps to make a complaint to airlines, still no response!

I had prepared myself to arrive early, checked in online and get boarded on time. However, I was notified that my flight would be delayed 30 minutes. At first I didn't mind. 30 minutes turned to an hour. An hour later, we were barely boarded and it took forever for our flight to take off. Myself and other questioned the staff about our estimated time and if we would make it to our connecting flight. We were told we would find out once we landed. Of course I missed my connecting flight and the next available flight would be at midnight to Chicago before I get to my actual destination. It's disappointing that United doesn't care or account for peoples time and inconvenience of being late to their connecting flights. Many of us either had to rebook or booked through another airline as none other United lines were outgoing direct flights anymore. I had to drop another $300 to fly with Southwest just to get home in time for work since United just couldn't accommodate for their short coming. I'll never fly United again. Money and time guzzler they are. No apologies whatsoever and the staff weren't much help and showed zero sympathy. Thank you Southwest for being available and on time.",-1

Then the flight was canceled and it took them another hour to get us off the flight. They gave everyone hotel rooms but transportation was on us. They wouldn’t give anyone their bags off the airplane either which is ridiculous. They also offered a laughable $10 food voucher. I guess everyone can buy a pack of overpriced m&ms tonight for dinner. I’ll never fly United again.",-1

Keep in mind there was no one sitting next to me, so my cabin should have had more space. Come to find out it’s her bag that’s taking up space in my cabin. The guy sitting behind me has his bag under his seat, she wouldn’t let me. Also I was very polite with her, so no reason for her to have been so rude",-1
2022-02-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Las Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely terrible experience with this airline,True," Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I had to cancel my flight as they changed the flight times and no longer suited my trip, can't get a refund which I am fully entitled to, spent 12 hours on web chat waiting for an agent only to be told they cant help, spoke with a supervisor who was extremely unhelpful and rude, filled out my refund form only to be refused my refund, got back in contact with web chat again and as I thought got in contact with a lovely helpful lady who reapplied my refund submission but a month later still no confirmation email or trace of a refund.

2022-02-08,0.9,Solo Leisure,First Class,Tampa to Los Angeles via Chicago O'Hare,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,onboard service was efficient and polite,True,"  To celebrate my birthday last week, I flew out to Los Angeles to visit the famous In-n-Out Burger viewing site for planes landing on runway 24R. In contrast to the litany of complaints about United on Skytrax, I had a completely pleasant and enjoyable experience with them. All three flights pushed back early, departed on time, and arrived ahead of schedule. The fare of $220 round trip was a bargain for two coast to coast trips, particularly considering that as a Gold Elite, I was upgraded in both directions. The onboard service was efficient and polite, the open bar was appealing, and even the meals met my (somewhat relaxed) standards. On the return portion, I had intended to visit the Star Alliance Lounge in the Bradley International Terminal, but the regular United Club in Terminal 7 has an attractive outdoor patio with unobstructed views of arrivals and departures on runways 25 L and R, so I remained there until boarding. I am happy with United Airlines, and I will continue to be a loyal customer.",1
2022-02-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,I will no longer be flying United,False,"  To start out, their website is deceiving and makes it look like things are much less expensive than they really are. Second, there is terrible customer service and most of their assistants are very hard to understand (they should have certain areas of the world be in charge of providing assistance to specific countries when they call). The most annoying thing is how much they charge for no reason. They charge extra in every possible way from baggage, to asking for assistance with flight bookings to the flights themselves. They take forever on the phone (over 3 hours), and I was transferred to over 5 different people. I am flying along, I can only imagine how frustrating this would be to do with a whole family. After the many frustrating experiences, I have had with United this one was the worst and will be the last. I will no longer be flying United and will continue to highly advise my friends and peers to do the same.",-1

2022-02-06,0.8,Family Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Newark,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,5,"pretty good, no complaint here",True,"  My flight back to NYC was on the day of winter storm Kenan that caused thousands of flight cancellations in the Tri-State area. As expected, our flight was cancelled, and United automatically rebooked us to a later flight in the day. The whole process was seamless and the flight arrived at Newark on-time, which was 5 hours later than my original flight; pretty good, no complaint here. Ground service at LAX was underwhelming. My father needed wheelchair service (as part of the ticket reservation), but we got no help. We were told to go to an unstaffed wheelchair area and called ourselves. The only bright spot was the United Club, which was much better than the one at EWR. As a result of cancellations and rebooking, we ended up on a Boeing 767-300ER, which was old and loud. However, I was grateful that it was retrofitted with the new, comfortable Polaris seats similar to those on the 787-10. The IFE was fine, but the headphones did not work, so I could not use the IFE other than the map. In-flight service was similar to that on the outgoing flight from EWR, which was quite good. Arriving at EWR at 1:00am, despite the point that the whole baggage collection area was empty, we were forced to share a carousel with a flight from SFO (both were full widebody flights). I was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with others collecting my bags, staring at a sign saying ""keep 6 feet apart"". As mentioned on my review on the outgoing flight from EWR, I think the cause for bad reviews on United in particular and US carriers in general, is about their operational logistics and philosophy, If they can fix that, their brand will be well received. Hope United see this review.",1
2022-02-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Diego to Houston via Montevideo,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,4.0,1,United business class is a disaster,True," The flight was from San Diego to Montevideo via Houston and Panama City, Panama. PTY to MVD was with Copa. SAN to IAH and IAH to PTY was with United. Same Aircraft both legs. United business class is a disaster. Do not waste your money. Old aircraft in need to updating. Very senior flight attendants that frankly do not care. Food that is equivalent to economy class on Alaska. Aircraft interiors from the 1990's. Save your money and fly another carrier. Copa on the other hand flies 737-MAX aircraft with lie flat seats and first class service. Funny that UAL calls their service First class while Copa calls it business class. UAL aircraft are so old that Lavs are beaten up. Screens have credit card swipers and seats whose cushions are long past replacement. You must ask the flight attendants for earphones. They give you ones that are complementary on economy on Alaska and Lufthansa. PICs below are on earphones and Business Class on COPA.",-1
2022-02-05,0.5,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Panama City to Houston,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,1,the amenities were not worth the price they charge,True," Connecting from a 7-hour flight on COPA airlines’ Business Class (with fully lie-flat seats) from MVD to PTY, I boarded this flight on United from PTY to HIA. The Business Class seats have nice cushioning but the recline is minimal (comparable to COPA’s Economy Extra seats). Before take-off we were offered a small plastic cup 1/8th full of champagne, and a cup with an equally tiny amount of water. If you request water during the flight, flight attendants provide you with cups with similarly stingy amounts. I very strongly suggest that you bring your own water bottles when flying a United Airlines aircraft even when you’ve paid for a Premium Cabin seat. No pillow or blanket is provided. No seat-back entertainment monitor. Cabin Crew were friendly, but the amenities were not worth the price they charge.",-1
2022-02-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,First Class,Houston to San Francisco,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,1,First Class was a disappointment,True,"  After a 7-hour flight from MVD to PTY on Copa Airlines, and a 4-hour United flight from PTY to Houston in Business Class, this flight from Houston to SFO in First Class was a disappointment. The lounge at Houston had pale food offerings. The airplane seats had minimal recline, the dinner was tasty but small. The seat back had a screen with a decent amount of movies and t.v. shows, though no headsets were handed out (I was hoping for a noise-cancelling set). Bring your own water bottles, because if you go to the galley to ask for water the two flight attendants who are talking with each other about personal things may ask you to go to your seat and wait.",-1
2022-02-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Detroit to Austin via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never fly with United Airlines again,True,"  I will never fly with United Airlines again! They cancelled my flight, they didn’t even send me any information. No e-mail, no text messages, no phone calls. I went to the AirPort and figured it out that they cancelled my flight and i had to pick another flight. I came to the airport second time in same day in time. This time they delayed my flight again. I had to be there in the morning, all my work schedule was ruined by them. They didn’t do anything to fix my problem. It wasn’t even cheap! I paid 230$ for this ticket!!",-1
2022-02-04,0.1,Business,Business Class,Chicago to Kansas City,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly with United again,False,"  Absolutely terrible experience. On the flight from KC to Chicago, we were told to switch planes after boarding due to the flight crew not having an adequate first aid kit. Although this wasn’t a huge deal and I understand mistakes happen, the delay caused myself and my coworkers to be late to our business meeting, which made us look terrible to the clients we were meeting. On the flight home from Chicago to KC is where the real issue was. I was seated wearing a mask, as the rules require, when I was approached by an incredibly rude flight attendant. From the way I was sitting she couldn’t tell that I had a mask on, so when she approached me she realized I did have one on. However out of her own pride, or some other reason that I can’t figure out, she went ahead and yelled at me in front of my boss, saying if she sees me without my mask on again she will “report me.” My coworkers and I sat dumbfounded because her yelling at me and causing this scene made absolutely no sense because I was doing nothing wrong. The flight delay due to the first aid kit ordeal wasn’t a huge issue, and as I stated mistakes happen. But the flight attendant being incredibly rude to me for no reason is unacceptable. I will never fly with United again, nor will my coworkers and boss that witnessed this. We work for a large company of over 5,000 employees and we will be sure to spread the word to the rest of the company to never fly with United again while on our business travels.",-1

The flight I originally booked was a one stop flight. In the months before my flight, the route was cancelled and changed twice and I had to spend hours on the phone with customer service to get the flights rescheduled and fixed. The first agent I talked to messed the flights all up, so I had to talk to someone else to fix them. After that, pretty much everything that an airline could do to have bad customer service happened. I don’t want to fly United ever again and would not recommend them to anyone. Fly Delta or someone else. Budget airlines I have flown with have been much better!",-1

My flight was such a lovely experience. I saw, the most kindest flight attendants, with infants, with myself and snacks, small but goes a long way. Very upbeat and thoughtful. I give them so much credit with patience to all of us who boarded. I was trying to see their names but the tags are soo small, and gray.",1

The man appeared, not a single word or hello and looked at the screen and then told me ""Passport and Covid test results?"". He printed my boarding pass, bag tag and tells me to go and hand over my bag to another lady. No please or thank you. The young lady accepting the bags (a subcontractor, not United staff) was actually pleasant and wished me a good flight. Once onboard, the seat was comfortable but the cabin was showing its age. The flight attendant serving Business class was just going through the motions, no warmth or motivation at all! The hot panini served on a 2:30hrs flight was greasy and tasteless.",-1

Horrible customer service, a complete scam at checked baggage. Told me bag was over by 2 lbs. Took out 1 pair of jogging pants and it dropped, so they tried to say jogging pants were 2 pound... no. Seats are uncomfortable, seat belts are smaller than other airlines. Charging area under seats very inconvenient. I will never fly United again. I paid the same with another airline and got to choose my seat, refreshments on flight, easy access to everything, United is a trash airline!",-1
2022-01-29,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Helena to Indianapolisvia Denver,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,unacceptable and unethical,True,"  My daughter (who just turned 17) flew United to Indianapolis. The flight from Helena left late and I contacted customer service to see if she would make her connecting flight. The representative told me that she would not and there wasn’t another flight to Indianapolis until the following day. As she is too young to get a hotel, I managed to secure a flight to Chicago and the representative informed me to have her go to the gate for a boarding pass. When she arrived at the gate, the gate agent laughed in her face and told her to sit down. Two times the gate agent asked her last name and escorted her to the gate to then inform her that the seat was not hers after all. She started crying because she was worried she wouldn’t get home and have to sleep in the airport. They then booked her on a later flight (after my husband had left to go to pick her up since it’s a 3 hour drive) the flight ended up leaving 4 hours late because of fuel supply issues and she didn’t get to Chicago until 3 AM. To have a minor treated in such a way is utterly unacceptable. I know that things happen but to have a gate agent laugh at her face while she was crying and then give away seats that has been assigned to someone else her is unacceptable and unethical. She’s a minor. Never again, United, and I have a credit card that I will be canceling",-1
2022-01-29,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Puerto Vallarta to Columbus via Chicago,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,I felt compelled to compliment everyone,True,"  First time I felt compelled to compliment everyone at United. The check in was swift and the lady that checked us in even changed seats so that we had no one in front or in back. At first I thought they might be accommodating us because we had a 1 year old and 5 year old and having the extra room really kept the crying and kicking the seat to minimum not just for our benefit but all surrounding customers. Not only a kind move but savvy for other passengers. The pilot let our 5 year old see the cockpit which he has been talking about for the last 24 hours. Attendants were very accommodating and kind. Despite any delays the pilots always mange to catch up time with minimal turbulence, (always thought it was cool pilots know when they are approaching choppy weather). The ability for these workers to remain positive and professional amongst continuous cranky passengers amazed me and thought they deserved the credit. Thank you!",1

I was using the bathroom and as I opened the door the flight attendants were serving snacks from the cart.

The attendant at the desk who’s name I forgot help me rebook the flight I missed after running to the gate. I was freaking out because I have asthma.

Then it flew for 4+hrs towards destination. Then we heard the announcement that flight is being taken back to origin. We saw 3 passengers were not complying with the rules and police came to escort them out as soon as we landed back at origin. Then after few mins of chaos, flight was cancelled! People were missing any important work or whatever, they didn't care. I had to reach the destination within the next 40 hrs but United couldn’t give me another flight. They booked me another flight with Air India with an extra cost of $1500 to me! I vowed to myself I will never fly with them again at any cost.",-1
2022-01-24,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Madison to Denver,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Crew was not communicative and avoided passengers,True," Worst flight of my life. Plane was supposed to leave at 8am, was boarded at 8.30 am, and left for the tarmac at 9.28 am. Then, a series of mechanical delays and poor communication lost us all three more hours. All of the passengers were hot (no fans), hungry (no food) and waiting until the plane finally took off at 12.32pm. There were multiple people asking to be de-boarded because they had already missed their connections. But despite the fact that airplanes should allow passengers to de-board after three hours stuck on board, this never happened (the plane took off 3 hours and 4 minutes after leaving the jet bridge and over 4 hours after boarding started - that isn’t ok). Crew was not communicative and avoided passengers. I cancelled my return trip with United and will never fly with them again.",-1

The passengers had already boarded and the plane was closed and was ready to take off. We were so upset. Pamela  who was a gate agent in Newark was so helpful and had gone beyond her duty. She called up the pilot and asked if they can reopen the plane and let us all in so we don't miss our flight. She also took our names and made sure our luggage came with us too. The pilot was kind enough to reopen the plane and allow us to go inside and get back home on time. Shannon helped us check online to see if our luggage made it too. We all got home safe and sound. Our sincerest thanks to all 3 of them.",1
2022-01-23,0.8,Couple Leisure,First Class,Chicago to Honolulu,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,this was a pleasing trip,True,"  Overall we were pleased. The onboard service was good as was the ground service. In fact the United Club personnel clued us in on another step required by the Hawaiian dept. of health which i was not aware of. They verified out vaccination status and health screening and gave us a wrist band which when identified by airport personnel in HNL enabled us to breeze thru to baggage claim. The IFE system a give a huge thumbs up for. its easy to use and has quite a large variety of TV shows, movies and music. The food was good but not great. The chicken I had was a bit overcooked which for a breast is easy to do. The vegetable entree with a risotto was fair as the risotto missed the mark. The drink selection was ok though there were not too many choices. The lie flat seats were ok though a but cramped when flat and you want to turn. The coat hook is in a bad spot. If you hang an item there it impedes pulling out the tray. However all in all this was a pleasing trip.",1

I had no time to complain at the airport. I took photos of the suitcase and called. The person I spoke with told me I had to go back to the airport to file a complaint. That is a 2 hour drive plus pay for parking. This is completely unacceptable. The airlines ruined my belongings and photos aren't proof that they destroyed my luggage.

2022-01-20,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,United is getting worse every time I fly,True," United is getting worse every time I fly. The planes are always dirty, seats are too small and people are crammed in like sardines with their knees in their stomachs, if you drop something there is no way to retrieve it until after the plane lands because conditions are so cramped and flight attendants are constantly ill mannered and rude. I booked through a third party and ended up with United only coming home. They did not tell me I would be charged to bring my luggage home until flight check in, the other airline did not charge for any of my bags. This racket is not acceptable. I was not forced to pay or abandon my luggage at the last possible moment. Then when we landed my luggage was filthy dirty and had foot prints on it. Now I know why I have broken items every time I fly United. They will not honor my accumulated miles. Apparently I do not meet the acceptable conditions, not sure what the miles are for if I can never redeem them. I am incentivized to gain these points that I cannot use when I try. Same with the flight vouchers for delayed and cancelled flights. I tried to use my last voucher and was denied over and over until it finally expired during covid. I called to request an extension and was denied. Finally to the female flight attendant on the flight from Orlando to Denver on January 19th, do not run into my children with your beverage cart. My kids were asleep and due to the minuscule size of the seats their legs had dipped into the aisle. First they were shoved aside, then run into with the beverage cart. The last time my three year old was run into the female flight attendant hit her so hard as she walked past that she actually pushed the baby off the seat. My children should not have been touched in the first place let alone harmed multiple times as they attempted to sleep through the flight. Life is hard right now for everyone, there is no reason to make it worse.",-1
2022-01-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Norfolk via Washington,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,I would not recommend United,True,"  Flight was from Milwaukee to Norfolk. There was a layover scheduled in Dulles Int Airport, Virginia. Flight was scheduled to take off at 6:30 am they did not begin boarding till 7am. During this time you can see the flight attendants and staff looking for other staff to get the plane started. Once boarded they had us wait an additional 40 minutes in the plane. The reason we left late was to ""defrost the plane."" We arrived to Dulles Int Airport, Virginia at 10:10 am where we were asked to wait outside while they unloaded our baggage. Another additional 10 minutes. Boarding time scheduled for Norfolk, Virginia was set for 10:15 am and departed at 10:41. By the time I reached Gate after running through airport, taking train to reach terminal it was 10:43 am. I missed flight. They had the next flight available at 5:49pm and I would reach Norfolk, Va later than 8pm. I would have to wait more than 7 hours in the airport. I had missed my car reservation in Norfolk, Va. I had to rent another car and drive 4 hours to reach my location Norfolk, Va. This delay costs time and a lot of money. I am disappointed with the lack of professionalism with United. Staff should not be scrambling to start the plane so it can be defrosted. This is something that should be done ahead of time. I would not recommend United.",-1

My grandfather passed yesterday and we needed to be in Santiago by 2pm to make it to the funeral. They changed our flights because the attendant did not know what he was doing and had to ask for help twice.

When I went to change my flight to the right flight, I was charged over $200. United airlines was unwilling and refused to wave the new fair price of the flight I was originally supposed to have. I am super inconvenienced and cannot afford to pay for my original flight and United Airlines disregarded my complaint through their app, customer service, and text.

They moved my seat 6 times after checking in pretty much 23 hours before the flight, so you would think your seat is locked in, by the end of the shuffle moved from an aisle to a middle seat which is not fair. Just when I got to the TSA the overhead bins were full and I had to check my bag, no big deal right? They gave me a tag and told my friend that he would get a tag at the door down by the plane. When we got down there, there was a lady who said he had to then carry it on the plane or go back and get it tagged after he was just told to bring it down and get it tagged down here. She got snippy not going to lie and then another person had the same problem and then another so then they just had to carry onto the plane and stick it under their seat.",-1

I don't know the name of the person but this shows that there's still good people in this world to help. Very pleased with the help today.  Saying this, if the start of my journey is on a positive note like I had on the phone today which Customer service gets a 10 then the rest of the trip does as well even before I take the trip back home after a long 8 weeks work trip.",1

I want to say thank You to Mr. Skewes at Washington Dulles United for helping me find another flight back it was all worth it, and thanks to you I will stick to United",1
2022-01-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Accra to Columbus via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,not recommend it to anyone,True,"  This is the worst flight I have ever been on. I missed my departure flight because they claimed the aircraft to transport me was faulty and so I arrived at my supposed destination a day after my chosen date. Coming back from my trip or vacation, my connecting flight was delayed and I was booked on the next available flight with 9 hours layover which was later changed to 11 hours 5 minutes. No food or water was even given as compensation. I was supposed to be at work but unfortunately I couldn’t make it because they cancelled the flight and kept extending the layover time. This is my first time flying United Airlines and I will definitely not recommend it to anyone. Their service is very poor because I have been at the airport the whole day after flying 11 hours from Africa to Washington. Look elsewhere for your tickets if you do not want to have this experience too",-1

Flying home on Monday Jan 10 they delayed my flight 2 hrs. I asked for a manager and told him it was important I maintain my 11:30 flight schedule i asked to be transferred to a Delta flight that was the same time, he said that was acceptable and the baggage check in could make those changes. When I went to baggage check in they changed there mind and said the flight was booked. I offered to go to the Delta with them to verify they had available seats they became rude and said there was nothing they could to do. At end of the day I just bought a ticket on the Delta flight that they said was sold out. If you like being lied to and delayed flights United is for you anyone may want to choose another airline.",-1

Lost our luggage going and coming back, 4 days to get our luggage on the return trip.

2022-01-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Denver via Portland,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,"don't mislead, and hold a flight",True,"  Our United flight was scheduled to leave Omaha at 6:00 AM on the Saturday before Christmas. Apparently several flights were scheduled to leave Omaha then and there was a bottleneck at the TSA. We made it and boarded our flight at 5:45. At 6:00, it was announced that we were holding the plane for 30 people stuck in security. Reasonable , but it created a smaller window for making our connection in Denver. There was then a mechanical delay and we left Omaha with a targeted arrival in Denver of 15 minutes before our departure time to Portland. I spoke to a flight attendant once in the air and expressed my concern about missing a connection. She found that 17 people on our flight were booked on the same flight to Portland. She said we may have to run, but typically when there are than many people potentially missing a connection, that they will hold a flight for a few minutes. Not completely reassuring, but I appreciate the attempt. There was mention of a cart at the gate, but this did not develop. We landed and deplaned 14 minutes before our connection was supposed to depart. I sprinted from our arrival gate to the connection departure gate and arrive as the first of 17 at 7:43, seven minutes before scheduled departure time. Our plane was still connected to the jetway and luggage was still being loaded, but the door had been closed. The agent at the gate said she was instructed to close the door and it could not be reopened. I made it clear that 16 other people with similar concerns were soon to arrive at the gate. She said it was not her choice to close the door and there was nothing that could be done. We were instructed to go see customer service and the agent left the gate. We went to customer service and that was disaster. Short version is that we had an overwhelmed agent book us on to a flight 13 hours later; while she slowly does this and adds us to a standby list for a 10:50 AM flight, three others from my flight get on standby before my wife and I. My wife is a rewards member so she goes to the top of the list, but I stay at 5 for a full flight. Wonder what will happen? We are given $10 food vouchers for our inconvenience, which do not cover a sandwich. While waiting for the 10:50, I see a United advertisement stating they are #1 in on time departures for five years in a row. I now understand why. At 10:40 when the doors are supposed to close, the flight has ten open seats due to late connections. Instead of giving the seats to standby passengers and closing the door like they did with our earlier flight, they announce that they are holding the flight for 10 minutes. Then a second agent shows up who starts to argue about closing the door. She sends the first agent away. At 10:48, she panics and calls up the first stand by (my wife) who scrambles to get a boarding pass and boards. There is one seat left at 10:49. I push for it, she yells at me as she prints a pass, and then a booked passenger shows up, takes my place, and the family is split. On my way back to customer service, I spot a Skywest to Eugene (100 miles from Portland). I hustle to the gate and try to board. The agent is great and I board to Eugene knowing I have to figure out a way home from there. I emailed this and more to United and they gave us a $75 credit. Not enough. Adjust your policies, don't mislead, and hold a flight! This was avoidable.",-1

I understand airlines are under stress during the third wave of the corona virus pandemic (January 2022). United was no exception and they cancelled our return leg of our flight back to the US. Until this point, I had no complaints. What sets the airlines (and any organization for that matter) apart is the customer service, and United barely registers. They are not only unreachable, they are rude to the core. They also failed to offer us a reasonable alternative when practically every other airline had multiple routes available. Terrible! I would stay away from United until the foreseeable future.",-1

I’m wondering who is the ring master to this circus and how a business operates with 100 planes and 3 doors/jetways.

So flight out was at 0655 & around 2100 the flight is cancelled due to crew issues. The message also said that United will be rebooking me. So I waiting for about a hour then called after hearing nothing. I was told by the computer that another flight was available & I requested to talk to an agent. The agent called me at midnight to tell me there was no flights available & I would have to drive in white conditions 4hrs to get another flight. Well weather got bad on the drive & missed that flight. To which I was chastised for not being there early & there was nothing they could do for me. So I had to cancel my whole trip, miss a close friend/family member’s wedding & of course they won’t refund me. So now I am out $1500, because they screwed up schedules for their crews! Worst part was how rude & uncaring everyone at United was.",-1

I had to do the return leg and they did not fail to disappoint. The plane seemed old and dirty but the worst part was once we landed, we had to wait over an hour to get to a gate. United had 3 hours to pick us a gate and make sure there was space. Obviously they have tried to save money and won’t move other planes so we had to sit on the plane for all that time. Avoid this airline, it’s just not worth the pain and the terrible service. United are all about profits and cost cutting first and customers are always last (and always wrong).",-1

Refused to issue refund, only travel voucher which was less than price paid for ticket. Well Done United. Since there is no mandatory testing I could have flown and exposed an entire airline.

I landed at Palm Springs at 6.30pm and United Airlines gave me no place to stay and no vouchers to eat. All of their support representatives were gone by the time I landed.

2022-01-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Washington,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,abhorrent and embarrassing,False," I have had the absolute worst experience of my entire life flying with United. They are unreliable, unapologetic, and will not answer their phones.  My first flight was cancelled mere hours before my flight (late at night with an early morning takeoff), with no alternative options for same-day flights. I was forced to buy a second ticket through another airline and have yet to be reimbursed by United. Additionally, United jacked up all their prices after cancelling hundreds of flights ($2k+ for a one-way ticket from DC to Houston) - the very definition of price gouging. My return flight (I had purchased roundtrip) with United was delayed by an hour and a half after I had already gone through TSA security check. After that, we continued to be held outside the gate even longer than expected and were then subjected to sitting on the aircraft for 45 minutes without movement. We were then informed that a part was missing from the plane (maybe you should have figured that out before boarding everyone?) and everyone was forced to deplane. After waiting for 20-30 more minutes, we were informed that a new part would not arrive until 6:30pm, no other planes were available for use, and we were not guaranteed takeoff at 6:30pm if we stuck around. All flight attendees then proceeded to rush to the customer service desk to find an alternative, and the best option I was offered was a next-day flight. I asked the agent to book this for me and she sent a travel itinerary. However, after searching my confirmation number on the United App I am being prompted that the flight does not exist and I will have to pay an additional. $600 to get on any flight tomorrow. I have been on hold with customer support for over two hours now and no one will answer my chat/calls. Still not sure if the agent actually booked me on a flight, but guess I'm supposed to show up at the airport at 5:30am with no boarding pass? United's treatment of their customers is abhorrent and embarrassing. I will never fly United again.",-1

2022-01-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Kalispell,3.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,United is terrible,False,"  United is terrible. I flew with them round trip and both days I was delayed. The first day I was delayed because they couldn’t get their staff here. I am a minor. I should not have to go up to them and try to reschedule our flight. When I went up she was not helpful at all and I couldn’t get on a flight. Luckily my dad got to them after waiting on the phone for hold for three hours. We had to rebuy a ticket to get me to the place I needed to be. On my way home first flight was great. Got ready for the next flight and they delayed it because again they couldn’t get their staff here. Why are you running a business if you cannot get your staff here? I was supposed to get home at 9. It is now 11 and I still haven’t left, because their pilot wouldn’t come. After sitting on the plane waiting for the pilot for 3+ hours we are finally taking off and all they do is say sorry. I will not be getting home until 2.30 in the morning after having to deal with their customer service which they were just grumpy and did not help.",-1
2022-01-01,0.2,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tel Aviv to Newark,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,try to avoid them,True," Tel Aviv to Newark. My original flight was canceled and I was bumped to a flight that leaves the day after. I received an SMS about it two days before the flight. The issue was that I paid an additional fee of 248$ to change my original itinerary to that specific day. I called the 1K customer service and waited 40 minutes for a response, and the customer service agent which was not helpful told me that it is impossible. The check-in for Polaris in TLV was very slow, in spite of the airplane being 2/3 full, and it took me 40 min to check my bag. The food was really bad and no refills were offered. The breakfast was borderline edible. However, the ""stars of the show"" on this flight were FAs in Polaris. I never encountered such disinterest and the absence of any customer service qualifications and desire to do the job. United FAs were always hit or miss, but this time it was a big miss. I am a 1K at United, and this year was very tough with them. Of the 23 flights I took - half were delayed or canceled. Customer service is unachievable in a reasonable time and usually helpless. Tickets in Polaris for this route are very expensive and not worth it. I would be taking my business to any other airline but I live not far from the airport where United has the majority of flights with few alternative options available. If you can, try to avoid them.",-1
2022-01-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,will not ever use United again,False," This airline has the rudest employees at the counter and a ridiculous app. My husband purchased tickets for our family to travel for Christmas. When we made it to the counter the morning of our flight, the lady at the counter was very rude and said we ""had not paid taxes"" for the infant ticket. She called someone ON HER CELL PHONE instead of the counter phone, and read my husband's debit card number out loud in front of a crowd of people. She charged us $132 at the counter for ""taxes"" for an infant ticket and was very impatient with us when we tried to understand why we were being charged this amount. When we called United Customer Support later, they told us that on the app they don't charge for the infant ticket, even though our infant was included in the confirmation. So, today, we leave to head home, and will have to pay another ridiculous amount for a ticket that apparently was reserved but not purchased, and this was not communicated to us through the ticketing part of the app. On top of it all, the customer service is just very disappointing. We will not ever use United again if we can help it.",-1

Hours later at a different gate I finally board and reach my destination. Upon arrival to baggage claim, I am told that my luggage was still in Newark, the original airport all the way across the country. I am extremely livid. 8 hours at the airport and my luggage couldn't get on the same plane as me nor was I even notified. I have my Christmas gifts, medicine both prescription and non-prescription in that bag, clothes, shoes etc. and I have no peace of mind to assure me that my bag is located and on it's way. I mean why exactly did I pay for a checked bag when it wasn't guaranteed that it'll board the same plane as me. If United Airlines is understaffed then don't board a plane at full capacity! Absolutely absurd and disappointed that this was my experience along with 34 other passengers whose bags did not make it as well. Hold times on the phone are over an hour, requests forms are done online via email. Like there is no authority to speak to about these situations and it's not cool to the customer!

2021-12-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Calgary,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,"a horrendous, costly experience",True,"  United Airlines royally messed up my Christmas trip to visit family I haven’t seen in years. Not once, not twice but THREE times. The first time they cancelled my flight (no reason given) I had to re-book it as well as the connecting flight from another airline (flight change fee plus an unplanned hotel stay to make the new connections). Now they cancelled that ""rescheduled"" flight and once again without any reason given. This second cancellation for the same trip meant I had to re-book flights from both airlines again plus stay overnight in a hotel again (flight change fee plus another unplanned hotel stay to make the new connections). When they cancelled the flight a second time and re-booked me on another flight I asked about my luggage. United Airlines Customer Service assured me it would be put on the new flight and arrive with me to my next destination. Well, that's mistake number three! They lost my luggage so I was stuck in a hotel room with nothing, plus I had to pay them a check baggage fee for them to lose it. Who knows if and when they will find and return my luggage in one piece! United Airlines has had a lot of cancellations lately because of flight crew shortages. Are they all Covid related and if so why? Aren't they wearing masks and practicing social distancing especially since they're responsible for the health and well-being of thousands of passengers? Also, United Airlines prides themselves on their “diligent cleaning protocols.” If they’re that diligent, why were there brown streaks running down the tray table in front of my seat? I just hope it was coffee and not something else. I haven’t flown in years and this trip was a horrendous, costly experience I never want to repeat!",-1

We never made it to our destination via plane. We ended up having to drive ourselves. The United staff at the San Francisco airport were rude. Called security on me for removing my mask to speak to her since she could not understand me, as employees of the airport walked around mask less through out the airport.

I was on a connecting flight from LAX to Liberia and I was watching a movie with my headphones on. I literally had the flight attendant hit my head with the seat. Then our returning nightmare trip began. We were very late flying out of Liberia (I should have known that was their style after all flights out were late). We were yelled at and accosted by the United agents in Houston airport as we were rechecked back in. We were then told that this flight would be late too (no surprise there). They explained on the PA that they were getting a flight to cover the malfunctioning plane. We waited almost 2 hours (until after 11:00 pm) and then passengers all started getting texts that our flight was canceled. We tried to find gate agents and every single gate agent told us that they couldn’t help us and hid behind the partition. We called customer service and I was on hold for 45 mins until I was hung up on. The customer service QR code would not work. When I called again I was told to call at 8:00 am the next morning. We tried to get assistance from the help desk at United but there were only 3 agents working and the line was well out into the hallway. We were rescheduled for another flight after 9:00 pm the next night without communication and my family separated. This entails missed work and a lot of money that we hadn’t planned on spending. Again, this flight was late and the only time I got a screen, mine was broken. I understand that weather and mechanical issues occur. I have flown for years with my job and strayed this once from Delta (this mistake will not happen again), but the lack of communication and deception is unforgivable. Houston needs to have a training on communication but I have the feeling that this is consistent throughout this company as they would also not help through their help number and QR code assistance. I will pay more to avoid this airline in the future.",-1
2021-12-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Phoenix,,,,,,1.0,1,pre flight experience had been beyond stressful,True,"  I normally just roll with the punches when flying, I understand things happening. But this was my first time flying (we haven’t even gotten on our plane yet) with my children and the before process has been a nightmare. I purchased my ticket back in September. Sunday 12-26 my tickets were cancelled (seats assigned, bags purchased and everything) as they were apparently a “duplicate” I was on the phone for over 5 hours trying to get our tickets fixed. We finally got it taken care of and our new itinerary sent to us. Monday morning 12-27 I try calling United customer service to find out about car seats and baggage as I was getting multiple different answers via the chat and it kept disconnecting because of wait times. I was transferred to a new representative every time I got a response. For some reason they thought messaging back at 0134 am Sunday night was acceptable. So, I called United CS 4 times, every time the call went through I was hung up on before the call even started and ended up having to wait HOURS longer on the phone. I finally called Savannah INT and asked to speak to baggage at United. As we’re going over our flight info it shows that my kids and I are no longer sitting together, they’re both under the age of 8. So, of course my questions were answered after calling the airport. Monday night my flight was cancelled again but at 6pm at night, knowing we had to leave at 4 am to make it to the airport for our flight. I waited on hold for another 2+ hours to speak to a representative to try and get our flights changed to a near by airport (which is 2 1/2 hours north of our original destination, but that was better than nothing right?) I tried changing it through the app but for some reason it wouldn’t let me because my second leg of my original flight was still scheduled. American and Delta do it for you. Let’s just say this was pre flight experience had been beyond stressful. I understand the holidays, so I try to be understanding. But customer service was absolute garbage. I’m highly dissatisfied with my experience thus far. We’ll see how the actual flight goes.",-1

I never fly with United but I needed to use my flight credits, from pre pandemic days, and so I booked with them. I called their customer service line, numerous times, because I wanted to use my remaining credits to change my flight time. They were so rude it was unbelievable. The first representative made me repeat myself, three times, because she wasn’t paying attention to anything that I said. The supervisor actually hung up on before yelling over me and disregarding my issues. Once I get to the airport, the desk clerks are unable to help me as well. I will never fly with this airline again.",-1

I generally don't write reviews good or bad unless the experience is exceptional. With United, it has just consistently been bad. Their customer reps are so poorly trained and mostly rude. A big part of the industry as they are, they contribute tremendous disappointments and terrible experiences to customers. I had stopped flying with them for a couple of years given their awful customer service after you have generously paid for their flights. Will once again stop flying with them till they can figure a better way to train their people before they shove them on customer service duty",-1
2021-12-27,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,4,beyond any expectations,False," The best customer service, beyond any expectations! I lost my passport on the flight (thank goodness I was in my country). The first cleaning staff didn’t find it however when the plane went to New Orleans a staff named Victoria found it. She got in contact with me and is sending it to me here in Canada. She took time during the holidays to make sure it was sent to me. She went above and beyond and I couldn’t be more grateful. I usually fly united because of the cost efficiency, gonna keep flying with them because of the service.",1

People waiting to pick me up stranded with no information. Typical United performance, care nothing about customers!

2021-12-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Raleigh Durham,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,do not care about their passengers,True,"  When they have delays, they deliberately don't give you on accurate estimate when there are delays - there's no incentive for them to do so, and they probably do this to try to keep people from getting angry. Every time I fly with them almost without exception we're delayed And they send delay updates on average about 5 times each delaying more. This is not an atypical experience with United. The other airlines are worth the extra cost, I've never had any experience like this with Delta, JetBlue, etc. Please don't fly with them. I've also had them overbook me before, not let me on my flight, then make me wait 6 hours in the airport for another flight. Terrible airline, do not care about their passengers.",-1
2021-12-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Denver,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I’m beyond frustrated and angry,True," I will never be flying with this airline again and would highly encourage others to choose a different airline. The aircraft ran out of room for my carry-on and made us check our bags at the gate. Now normally I don’t check bags, I don’t trust it but seeing as it was a direct flight and it was at the gate I didn’t think it was possible for them to loose my bag. However I was mistaken. Upon landing our luggage was nowhere to be found, staff have been extremely unhelpful in tracking down this bag which has irreplaceable items in it. Customer service has not done anything to help us track down our bag and has basically told us that there’s nothing they can do ""because Denver is just such a big airport"" and informed us that our bag was never even checked off the plane. It has been ten days now, we have attempted to fill out the claim form several times and it has refused to submit. No one in the service centers seem to be able or willing to help us submit a claim. I’m beyond frustrated and angry at the lack of assistance or customer service we have received and at the fact that our bag was lost on a direct flight that was checked at gate. I don’t see how this incompetence is even possible. Save yourself a the time money and frustration and fly with a different airline.",-1
2021-12-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Savannah,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,Terrible experience,True," Newark to Savannah. Terrible experience! I had a trip booked for my Bachelorette party. Was flying as 8 girls from Newark airport to Savannah airport. The night before our trip after 10pm, we all receive messages saying our flight has been canceled. I called United immediately. I was on the phone for over 2 hours, I was stressed, I was crying, I was trying to re-book 8 girls to Savannah and some had already fallen asleep so I wasn't able to contact them to discuss options. They told me there were zero options to fly us out that day from any NYC airport. After 2 hours on the phone, the absolute best we could do was have a connecting flight from Philadelphia to Washington DC to Savannah. I live 20 minutes from Newark airport (a $30 uber ride), the 2 hour uber ride to Philadelphia airport was over $200. Our flight out of Philadelphia was delayed, and we missed the connection in DC. Ultimately, a 2 hour flight from Newark to Savannah turned into a 17 hour total trip time. We could have driven to Savannah in way less time. On the phone call, I felt forced into making the decision while there were no good options. I kept asking for compensation options because of the insane delay and increased cost to get to Philadelphia. I was told I can file a complaint with Customer Care after I book. When I returned from my trip, I filed a complaint and was told that because I accepted a different flight, there was nothing they could do. This airline is a scam, they do not have customers interests in heart. I would rather fly Spirit than United.",-1
2021-12-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Little Rock via Houston,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,We were lied to multiple times,True,"  Every single employee we encountered with United was horrendous. We were lied to multiple times about our delays, flights, baggage, reimbursements, etc. Our flight was delayed due to weather which I know is not the airlines fault. But then they couldn't put me on a layover to my destination for 3 days. We booked a flight to another airport 3+ hours away and were told to rent a car, when asked if we could get a reimbursement for the $200+ rental car the agent said ""maybe but unlikely since it's not our fault"". I'm not sure how an airline can explain that being unable to get a passenger to their destination is not their fault. After sitting in the airport for overnight and finally getting through security, my husband talked to United customer service. The agent magically found a flight to our destination that morning with plenty of seats available. Yet the agent the night before couldn't see any flights. We were assured our check bag would be going to our final destination - not the airport 3+ hours away but when we got to our airport.... no baggage. We've been told for the past 3 days that our baggage is ""on it's way to your house"" but last night while we were sleeping a United agent left my husband a voicemail asking if we wanted to come pick it up. Clearly it was not on the way to my house then if it's sitting at the same airport. Now no one at the airport who works for United will answer the phone and no other United employees are ""allowed"" to open the office where they hold luggage. This airline is 100% not worth it. To top it off - if you read the news and are COVID cautious, do not listen to what the media says about United being top notch with protocols. Green slime was all over our AC vents on the plane (clearly hasn't been cleaned in a longgg time) and stewardesses spoke to us with their masks pulled down.",-1

I purchased my seat prior to check in. The Employee at the gate gave me a different seat, although I showed receipt that I paid 160$ for a seat that I chose. The employee could not give me the seat I needed. It’s unfortunate and frustrating that I paid for a seat that I couldn’t even have.",-1
2021-12-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Tampa,2.0,,3.0,,2.0,1.0,1,Horrendous customer service,True,"  Horrendous customer service. I have had so many bad experiences with United Airlines. The amount of times I have seen them not do their jobs is ridiculous. There have been circumstances where I would be sent to the other side of the airport for customer service, just for customer service to tell me the gate attendants could have done the same thing at their station. I have also seen them close the gates earlier than expected, even denying access to disabled people when they have no control of how fast they can be taken to their gate. I myself have spoken to 3 other passengers (2 elderly women and 1 father with 2 kids) who have been denied access because the gate attendants simply did not want to their job. I hope the customer service will improve because it is honestly a nightmare. We especially had an awful experience with a gate attendant who had no sense of customer service and gave nothing but a passive aggressive , rude response to everything. Please choose a different airline to travel with.",-1
2021-12-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Brussels via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,paying $400 on an extra bag,True,"  I travelled to Cameroon 2 weeks ago I am still very upset for paying $400 on an extra bag, When I left home, I was prepared to pay the required $200 for the extra bag, United Airlines (UA) told me since that extra bag is 11 pounds overweight (50+11 = 61 pounds in total), I must pay an additional $200, that was so unexpected and hard on me financially, I ask them why don't they charge per pound instead of having people paying 1extra pound as if it was a separate bag of 50 pounds? They say it their policy, yes a nonsense policy. On my way back to the US, in the flight UA998, I felt asleep when the flight attendant was distributing snacks and drinks, when I woke up, I was thirsty and noticed that they gave drinks to travelers, I asked for a drink, they said to wait because the plane is prepared to land, I waited and they promised to give me a drink once we land. I reminded them after we landed, the attendant said her co-worker refused and argued that they won't give drink to passengers to walk out the plane, I went and asked another attendant, she was drinking a cup of water herself and looked for what to say and finally replied the cabins are locked until the next flight, she just gave 2 different answers for the same request. I was very surprised that nowadays, people still find the courage to be so selfish even on a cup of water that I deserved as all other passengers.",-1
2021-12-20,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bozeman to Boston via Newark,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2,my experience was a disaster,True,"  In a word, awful. My connecting flight in Newark switched gates 3 times, and was 90 minutes delayed. Despite the fact that the flight was about 25% empty, they made me check my bag because it was “too big,” despite the fact that it was acceptable for the first three united flights the same weekend. The flight attendant was antagonistic, and not customer focused whatsoever. The in-flight wifi did not work at all. When I now access the “united app” to submit feedback, the only button that has no response is the one labeled “submit feedback.” Kudos to the captain for getting us from point A to point B in one piece; otherwise my experience was a disaster. He politely explained that part of the reason for the additional 30 minute delay was due to the baggage handlers not being timely in loading the bags (yes; the same ones they wouldn’t let us bring on thr plane). Given the choice, next time I’d rather be all home from Montana than deal with the unprofessional flight attendant on this flight UA2669. I rate a 5 as they actually got me home in one piece, which is the least you can expect.",-1

The airline lost my luggage as they left it in Denver overnight. Once it arrived in DC they ""could not contact the delivery company"" to return the luggage. Most importantly have I have had to spent 30 hours without a medical device. This company is a joke. After spending $1300 in airfare they offered me $120 and told me to ""go to the emergency room"" for medical care.",-1

She was 21 months old. From checking in to getting off the flight, United airlines staff were helpful and kind. A staff member helped us check our bags and even took some over to the check-in counter. We caused a bit of traffic congestion folding up our stroller to go under the seat, but we felt absolutely no pressure from staff about it. Quite the opposite, they helped get everything away and stowed for us. Multiple stewardesses checked up on us several times, asked us if it was our first time flying with an infant, and if they could get us anything. They made the entire trip much more managable and much less stressful.",1

Our flight was canceled due to a mystery weather advisory, the weather in Mobile was clear it never rained and it rained in Houston for two hours. We tried to rebook, there were no flights until the following Tuesday. That was not an option because me and my husband both had to be at work on Monday. I tried calling customer service. Starting at 10 pm, I waited on the phone for two hours. Never reached anyone. So we had to rent a car and drive 8 hours home. I paid for a round trip ticket, so I expected a round trip home. I will never fly United again. Hopefully I'm able to get a refund.",-1

Ten different reasons why from a broken piece from a failed push to others not answering the phone. Hand counts of passengers and claims of off weight differential from one person leaving the flight. Finally get to Chicago with almost everyone missing their connection. We are told to go to one place for customer service only to be sent to another place. Get there and there's one person working with one ""supervisor"" there. They offered McDonald's and a comp at an already booked to capacity hotel. My kid was waiting in South Bend. When I asked the staff member for her supervisor, she literally said, ""There's nobody above me!"" She then walked away. United claims there is nothing they can do, despite us purchasing the insurance. They clearly have no clue how the purchase of goods and services work. No surprise with their well known history of failure. Since they fail to accept an already admitted responsibility, I'll just say that I hope they go under. I have zero faith in anyone from United. To me, they're all incompetent.",-1

As well, when we finally got there they put the ramp on the plane wrong and had to redo it. This all took over half an hour. The line for customs was also long and no one would help me or others trying to catch our connection to Vancouver. Once I got through customs I ran through to the United counter and they told me I had missed my flight. The employees wouldn't do anything for me and I had to pay for my own accommodation and meals in San Francisco until I could leave a full 24 hours later. On top of that, when I got back to Canada and turned my phone data back on, I got a text that the flight they said I had missed my flight, it had left late and I could have made it! None of the United employees had any idea what was going on with their own flights. I'm honestly so surprised and disappointed. This was completely avoidable and I'm out over $150 USD because of it.",-1
2021-12-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Kahului,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolutely ridiculous and honestly so disappointing,True," The most disappointing experience with an airline my family has ever had. We had to reschedule our flights for a later day (maybe 2 days later) because my brother was rushed to the emergency room the day before our original flight for emergency surgery. The airline tried to up-charge us $800 a person to change our flights for 2 days later when we had already paid $300 for each seat. Absolutely ridiculous and honestly so disappointing, especially around the holiday’s and after the kind of year my family has had. Honestly would have wished we would’ve never even planned this trip in the first place because of United and how unaccommodating they are. Do not think we will ever fly this airline again unless some kind of compensation for our troubles are given.",-1

However, upon boarding it still had food stains on the seats. The flight attendants also told us they’d run out of pillows, I guess because we were flying economy.

2021-12-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Leon to Guanajuato,,,,,1.0,1.0,2,past the cut off time by one minute,True,"  On an early morning flight I brought my daughter, her father and brother to the airport. They had already checked in using the app, paid for checked luggage, had boarding passes, etc. We were running late but it’s a very tiny airport and there’s usually very little wait time. They went to drop off the bags to be checked, which had already been paid for, and again they already had their boarding passes etc. The ticket counter person adamantly refused to check the bags because we were past the cut off time by one minute. She even said, you are one minute too late. This is someone traveling with two kids, and has Christmas presents for his family. I asked if there was any way to check the bags on a later flight going to the same destination. She said no. Their flight got delayed due to weather. I asked if we could check the bags now since the flight was delayed. She said no. Then they announced that the flight could not take all the luggage because of the weight limitations, and that some of the luggage would need to be put on a different flight and arrive later. I asked if I could at least get their luggage included with the other luggage not going on that flight. She told me no. I asked her if she’d do anything at all to help me get their luggage to them, and she told me no, you should’ve gotten here earlier. We were literally one minute past the cut off at a very tiny airport with no lines. Her demeanor was very rude and unhelpful. Given the flight was delayed AND they ended up not putting all the luggage on that flight, I don’t see why she wouldn’t let us check the bags other than to punish us for being late. She could have definitely checked the bags. Now two kids and their father are visiting family for 3 weeks with no clothes, no Christmas presents for their family, etc.  Yes We should’ve gotten there earlier. But her behavior was not necessary and she could have checked the bags. They were already paid for, boarding passes already obtained, all she had to do was put them on the belt and add a label. We were ONE minute late. And then multiple instances arose where she could have easily allowed us to check the bags but simply refused, with a very rude demeanor.",-1

United switched plane types and did not assign me a seat. I was not assigned a seat even after check-in for the first leg of my flight. United trying to force me to pay for an upgrade seat that I don't want to pay for and I initially had my seat selection made. United should at least at check-in let someone select seats for all available flights especially since I already had selected seats and the lack of a selected seat was due to United's action not mine.,-1

So I placed a order for a new flight because it was cheaper then just changing the missed flight time. After booking I was told my ticket was not refundable by another representative and the supervisor Brian didn’t even try to help me. I’m disappointed.

Things weren’t lining up in NC to where I would be there when I needed to be so I cancelled I buy a ticket later in the day. I paid a 400 dollars difference and they refuse to refund me my money. I cancelled the reissued flight 30 min after purchasing. United are thief's and a unsympathetic airline with liars as agents and customer care reps that don’t know what they are talking about. I would like my 400 dollars back considering the nature of the situation and because it’s the holidays. Take money from me and give me a United flight credit?,-1

Each time, we were promised our infant would have a bassinet. Each time we called back to follow up - they had no record of our past calls. They also said on the phone - after an hour of waiting - that they couldn’t accommodate vegetarian or gluten intolerant eating. When we got to the flight they had no record of the multiple bassinet requests and our family had to split up and lost our seats despite having paid absorbent amounts for business class.

You buy the tickets online thinking you are paying good prices, but then you have to pay hundreds for every thing. The baggage check in, 100 USD each. Then the seats. If you are a couple, they ""randomly"" assign the worst seats in the plane for a 8-hour flight: the last row in which you cannot lay back the seat and, of course, separated seats. You have to pay another 100 USD each to select the seats. So you will pay in total 400 USD additional to the amount you paid when you bought the tickets. Finally, the check in process is not intuitive, when you usually do it in 5 minutes, with United Airlines you spend 30 minutes.",-1

On both flights, departure and return flights once on board the plane, passengers would pull their masks under nose or chin and travel this way the entire trip. Returning we had a group of 8 come onboard all coughing and the masks pulled down on chin. Staff never asked them to wear masks correctly. So little disregard for their passengers prompts us not to :Fly the Uncaring skies of United.""",-1

This was my first time flying with United in many years and it will be my last. I paid for 1st class and yet they allowed frequent flyers to board before 1st Class passengers causing a long line to get on the plane. I usually fly on Delta or American and they always call 1st class passengers after elderly and Veterans. I also don't like that they don't have screens on the seats in front of us, and there was no place to comfortably put my tablet to watch entertainment on. The other airlines either have screens on the seats in front or they have something that drops down from the seat to easily put our device on to watch entertainment. This plane didn't have USB to plug into for charging. I fly a lot and I haven't been on a plane recently that doesn't have USB. They just have the regular outlets and they were very difficult to get to. I had to get on my knees in the aisle and bend over with a light just to see the plug so that I could plug in the power for my device. I went to the Orlando, FL United club; I've been in many airline clubs and I've never been to one so bad. It was small, over crowded, and very little food selections. It was very disappointing. For all of these reasons, I will not be flying on United again.",-1

First our flight was late because they didn’t have a plane so took an extra 30 min. Second we get on the plane and there is no more room for bags so we had to get back off the plane and check bags. Finally get sat down in the seat after the safety inspection and we had to sit for another 45 min to wait for maintenance to take their time to get down and try to fix it. I will never be flying with United again. Cheap flight I guess you really do get what you pay for.,-1
2021-12-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to New York,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,the worst airline I have ever dealt with,False,  Never will be using United again. Not enough room for my carry on bag so was told to get off plane and check bag. Our flight was supposed to leave at 7.50 am and we are sitting on the plane still waiting on maintenance. I will be at the airport and sitting parked on this plane than my whole flight. This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with.,-1
2021-12-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Savannah to Chicago via Appleton,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Extremely disappointed,True, Run from one terminal to another to not miss my flight only to be told that they were doing maintenance and they were hoping to still get us on our flight for 2:50pm to arrive in Appleton at 3.57. They got a new plane and told us to go from F25 to F3 only to get there and be told there is a delay with this flight. Not once but numerous times. The latest update is that we will depart at 4.40. This is Chicago! You have access to a ton of planes to pick from! Long week working to end my week like this is not pleasant. I will be traveling often and will no longer book thru United. Extremely disappointed.,-1

2021-12-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to San Francisco,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1,customer service was the worst,False,"  The aircraft was the best to fly but customer service was the worst. I have never come across such ungroomed and rude workers on an airplane ever. Even the crew members on the domestic flights in India where I travelled were much much better than these crew members on an international flight. When you ask for a coffee one said ""I don’t have it with me"" when I mentioned that the salad is frozen and very cold, the guy said ""then don’t eat it""! Such rude people. I was not flying for free! I had paid full charges for the flight and did not deserve such poor customer service. Very disappointed. The third world countries have better services there. Learn something from them now. And please keep yourself fresh and groomed!",-1
2021-11-30,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose Costa Rica to San Jose via Denver,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,making my flight the best,True,"  I am writing this review to say how amazing joe and Brian are! I was on a flight back from my travels in Costa Rica, and catching the second leg. I got on the second leg with barely a minute to spare after my flight from before ran late, I didn’t have time to eat, was in an emotional state and overall very stressed! A side note to the stress, I have low blood sugar and was beginning to feel the effects when I got onto the flight. I couldn’t figure out the United App and was beginning to worry if I was even going to be able to get food on my flight. Then in come my heroes Joe and Brian! They helped me with the app and got me food immediately (this was before they even knew I had a medical condition, they simply cared that I was stressed and wanted me to enjoy my flight). They were kind, friendly, helpful, informative and basically every trait you would want in a flight attendant and human being! They showed this care to me and then I watched them show the same care and attentiveness to every guest seated on that airplane. I fly for my work and have been back and forth between 30 countries in the past few years, essentially what I’m saying is I’ve flown many times on many planes with many flight attendants. I have never until this trip been so positively impacted by the flight staff on one of my trips! Thank you Joe and Brian for making my flight the best I’ve ever had purely through your kindness!",1

Registering at the airport: the pre-booked seats were not the one assigned (I naively did not check when receiving the boarding pass). My wife's Miles&More card was not registered on the basis ""the system does not accept it"". Business Lounge, crowded, with people standing in line for a sitting. Cleanliness entering the Plane: no oral welcome but a small sanitized tissue, wait over 3 minutes for someone to take jacket and coat. A so called ""Glass of Champagne"" (in fact some sort of sparkling white wine) was offered in a plastic cup. No written menu but an oral (difficult to understand) choice of main course. No choice of wine except ""red or white served in a plastic cup. The food overall at the level of ""economy class"". Seats are so narrow that both shoulders are squeezed like in a coffin. Feet cannot be side by side in the narrow space both in width and height. Entertainment system is so unfriendly that it took 2 different crew members to explain it. The Star Alliance will be well advised to drop the failing UA star from their group.",-1
2021-11-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Washington,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,This airline is the worst I’ve ever been on,False,"  This airline is the worst I’ve ever been on. They didn’t clean the plane in time for us to board the plane. The boarding process was the slowest I’ve ever experienced, and they didn’t even inform the 4th group that there was no longer any overhead storage. So, customers had to literally go to the back of the plane to find out and then had to go all the way back to the front to check them. It’s hilarious because the lady at the kiosk promised us they’d be on time and we are late. It is past the time we were supposed to take off and we still haven’t. This is the most pathetic excuse of an airline I’ve ever been on and if you have any other options to fly, absolutely use those and forget this airline.",-1
2021-11-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berkeley to Redmond,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,the guy next to me never had his mask over his nose,False,"  Where to start. The hidden charges are over the top. I started with a $290 fare that ended with a $434 bill. For a one-hour flight. Plus if you don't purchase a seat at the time of purchase there may not be a seat when you get to the airport. $35 for a checked bag that measures 12x16x4 is more than outrageous. Onboard there's a small cup of soda and not a peanut or pretzel insight. Not that I care but for the cost of the ticket I should have filet minion. But what bothered me the most was the Mask protocol. They ran pre-recorded announcements every fifteen minutes or so - even at the gate before boarding. It talked about wearing masks over the nose and mouth and how bandanas were not acceptable. Yet, on the way to Bend, the guy next to me never had his mask over his nose. There was not one time the attendant asked him to pull it up - even as he ordered more drinks from them. On the way back from Bend the guy across the aisle was wearing a bandana but no one brought him a mask, 10% of the people didn't have the mask covering their nose. Including the person in the wheelchair with an airport escort, wasn't told to pull up his mask. I will do anything I can not to never take United again.",-1

Flight attendant giving us a lecture on how we even got on the flight without pre/registering our credit card. Trying to watch a movie with on-board entertainment app and it kept buffering every 4-5 minutes, flight attendant suggested I walk up to the front of the plane to get the signal back. This airline is terrible! And sadly do not care about their customers or the experience flying with them 2-10 rating..",-1
2021-11-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Barbara to San Francisco,,,,,,1.0,1,Absolutely terrible,True,  Absolutely terrible. This was my first time flying with them. Didn’t even board the plane it was delayed for some computer glitch. Then went to the counter to receive help the lady did not help me fix my connection. I went back out of security to go talk to the people working the desk to try and get some help as I am only 18 trying to get home to my parents I was then said I don’t even know what you expect me to do and then left with zero help.  Went to the Alaska desk and they happily helped me and comforted me switch my flight over from United to actually get to my destination.,-1

She couldn’t tell us why or anything and recommended we check at gate, not telling us TSA would take our items that couldn’t be in a carry on. I asked if we could get reimbursed for it and they referred me back to United. United States they aren’t responsible for what TSA does. I just really don’t appreciate The agent telling us our luggage wouldn’t arrive",-1

It is now 3.24 and we have not moved an inch. If you can, fly any other airline. This could have been solved with better operations. I’m avoiding United at all costs unless they make up for this somehow.",-1
2021-11-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Chicago,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,4,Will never Fly United again!,False,"  At the airport for my return flight, we were greeted at baggage by the rudest person ever. I had fractured my ankle and was in a wheelchair. Not only did he not help me at all, but he very blatantly called my family ignorant. Then he walked away and refused to help us. A manager was called for his behavior and we were told that there was nothing United could do about him as he was a contract employee. I have never been called ignorant by a professional and I hope I never do again. Corporate was called and they got all the information and told us there was going to be an investigation and mean while they took off my upgrade which was like $37.00. They told me they would contact me further once the investigation was completed for further refund. It has been a month now, and I still have not heard anything from them. Will never Fly United again!",-1

I flew from the U.S. to Malawi in October 2021, via Frankfurt and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. While I've been in Malawi, the conflict in Ethiopia has worsened to the point where the Embassy has warned travelers to avoid travel through Ethiopia and the FAA has issued an advisory warning that aircraft flying through the country may be subject to ground-to-air weapons fire. As the conflict has escalated, I've reached out to customer service several times to ask them to either re-route me or issue a refund so that I could afford to purchase a different, safe flight home in December. They've continually refused any assistance, nor has the flight insurance I purchased from UA been able to help. Don't fly this airline.",-1
2021-11-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Kansas City via Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,horrible customer service,True,"  I will never use this airline again. I was flying from san diego to MCI and had a layover at IAN (Houston). My first flight was fine, no delays, just a jam-packed flight. I arrived at IAH and walked to my connecting flight. All was good and I was there 10 mins before boarding, the screen said boarding in 10 mins. However, about 5 min before boarding the screen changed to cancel. Nobody knew what was going on, not even flight attendants. We got a text saying that we had to fly to Chicago the next day and then to KCI because obviously the flight was canceled. The flight had a layover of about 4 hours and clearly, some passengers had to arrive at a specific time due to family, plans etc. We were all pretty much told we were out of luck. We got a 10 dollar food voucher however at this time it was nearly 11:30 and no food places were open. Put us in some dingy hotel.  I needed to get my luggage so that I could change and charge my laptop and then after waiting nearly 1.5 hours for my bag, I went and asked the united baggage claim where it was, and they said well sorry your bag is in Chicago. Ended up flying Delta without my luggage and took an earlier flight so that I could still see my family and get to Kansas earlier. That being said, my luggage was on the plane from Chicago to Kansas and I had to wait for it to arrive. I got to MCI at 11:15 and my luggage was supposed to arrive at 11:00. The flight my luggage was on had a 5 hour delay and I had to wait in the MCI airport for an additional 4.5 hours after arriving. The moral of the story, United Airlines has horrible customer service, they won't even help you in person unless you cause a scene and even then it's nearly impossible. Rather than in person, they tell you to just use a QR code to speak with support, and even once you reach that person it is very clear that you're not speaking to someone fluent in English/knows what you're talking about. Unreliable and easily the worst flight experience that I have had in my LIFE.",-1
2021-11-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to St. Thomas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,zero communication throughout the entire experience,False,"  The worst airline and worst customer service! Do not fly with United. They left me stranded on an island with no promise to get home. There was zero communication throughout the entire experience. Upon calling, I was hung up by 4 people. No one has helped us at all. They also on this flight broke my suitcase!",-1
2021-11-15,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Los Angeles,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Never ever again — fly Alaska or JetBlue,True," I usually take Alaska but I was using my travel credits, I didn’t realise my flight back was United until it was too late. Never again. I fly a lot for work so I’m used to bringing a carry-on, but this was a personal trip. I know, I should have read the carry on info but this was a unplanned trip and I am glad I used my travel miles for this instead of a trip I wanted. So warning If you are used to carrying a carry-on wheel bag and you do United Airlines basic, prepare to pay. Also if you paid extra for a seat don’t do it. I did and they didn’t give me that seat. Also, the first person I am greeted by is the United Airlines check-in person and she was mean and not welcoming. If your on a budget and willing to be charge for every little thing choose United. It’s basically the price of a regular ticket and I wish I choose Alaska but beggars can’t be choosers. I would tell you about the flight but let’s just say the beginning continues to the end. Never ever again — fly Alaska or JetBlue, at the end of the day you pay the same or a little more for a more quality service.",-1
2021-11-13,0.4,Couple Leisure,First Class,Baltimore to Denver via Sacramento,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,little to no distinction from economy,True,"  First Class Service - so disappointing. First class with United has little to no distinction from economy class. Each way on my roundtrip flight, I had to check myself in at the kiosk. No special service there. First class bags are supposed to be priority at baggage claim. Not ours! Food service in first class now consists of a hot-pocket in a paper bag and wine served in a dixie cup. The hot-pocket was not only gross, but incredibly unhealthy. I certainly understand the concern over COVID, but really, that is the best they can come up with. There was no in-flight entertainment.",-1
2021-11-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Every time I regret it,True," Worst airline in the world! I fly all the time and have flown United 6 times in my life. Every time I regret it. From customer service, to policies, to travel timeliness, to overall experience. You name a problem and it has happened on United. In 6 attempts usually 2-3 things have gone wrong. Currently they made me check a bag that only has 2 suits in it for a wedding. Was happy to pay a fee or anything to carry it on. Contemplated putting on the two suits so they don’t get wrinkled. They showed up in terrible shape as expected. Basic fair is a scam that tricks you into spending more money. This isn’t a premium airline as Spirit is more accommodating and on time more. At this point I’ve flown every US carrier more than 5 times and for domestic travel none have even been close to as many problems as United. Avoid this airline at all cost. I’d take a flight that took me 2 hrs longer connected and was hundreds of dollars more expensive to fly any other airline. Their flight won’t be on time anyways and the experience is so bad that it is worth the difference. The fact that I’d connect instead of fly nonstop and pay more to do so to avoid this airline says something.",-1
2021-11-11,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Newark,2.0,,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3,I should have stuck with Delta,True," The flight was delayed over an hour which caused me to delay my connecting flight for overseas. One of the reps was very patient and assisted me with rebooking my next flights. Once I got to Newark, the customer service took a dive. They were either slow or rude. They did not acknowledge the customers, didn’t even look up from their phone or computer to see the growing line of customers. The lady at the customer help desk had to call support on the phone after 20 minutes of trying to figure out how to book a hotel for me on their dime. Once I got my hotel voucher after 40 minutes of waiting, I went to find my bags. The luggage help desk again were either slow or rude. I had to explain 3 times that I’m trying to retrieve my bags because I would’ve missed the connecting flight due to the first delay (15 min). Then waiting another 15 min for the guy to tell me where my bags were only to tell me I’m not allowed to go there. Then asked me again what I was trying to do with my bags! So again I said I wanted to retrieve my bags! Now I’m waiting another 35 minutes so my bags can be placed on the carousel on the other side of this terminal! I have walked back and forth from being referred to someone else so many times that I have already completed all the rings in my activity all on my Apple Watch. 90% do not recommend if you have other options. I should have stuck with Delta and cut my vacation time short instead.",-1

2021-11-10,0.7,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Los Angeles,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,4,Ground service was not great,True,"  I purposely picked this particular flight to experience United Boeing 787-10. However, the airline changed equipment to a Boeing 757-200. The aircraft was old and loud. However, the flatbed seat, though had neither direct aisle access nor much privacy, were quite comfortable. The food was decent, though all were presented at once on a single tray, and wine was served in a plastic cup, a stark contrast to what were a few years ago. I hope that was just due to special measures during the pandemic. Ground service was not great. There was no check-in counter for business class. We had to use the self check-in counter and then carried our luggage to a bag drop area. The United Club was super crowded that it was nearly impossible to find seating. I thought staying at the gate area was better. The flight departed and arrived on-time, well, on a nice day, but that is still a plus.",1
2021-11-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Seattle,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely miserable experience,False,"  Minor mechanical failure of the oven (only for first class) forced us to turn back. After that we had to change planes, adding another hour to the trip. Then the crew had to change because that had gone past some number of work hours. Then we waited on hour for food (again, only first class) then another half hour for fuel. Absolutely miserable experience, United offered no kind of refund, amenity, or anything beyond a weak apology.",-1
2021-11-09,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Washington,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,reduction in Polaris amenities,True,"  The service was really efficient and pleasant. The plane was clean and comfortable. Check-in was smooth and friendly. I was generally pleased with everything aside from one important detail. I appreciated the personalized service both in the air and on the ground. We landed at 4:30 and one hour later, I was enjoying a glass of wine at home. Smooth all the way. However, the food served in Polaris was several notches below what one would expect in business class...pretty similar to what was once served in economy class domestically in days gone by. And the menu was exactly the same outbound and inbound. There is a definite reduction in Polaris amenities. From its touted debut to the present, it has taken something of a nosedive which is very disappointing and should be rectified if they want to stay competitive.",1

2021-11-04,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to Chicago via Denver,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,1,found we had to pay for carry-ons,False,"  When did tickets where you cannot even bring on a carry-on? I got a pretty decent deal on tickets so I paid extra to sit next to my husband. We packed light and had a small carry-on each. We got to the airport and found we had to pay for carry-ons. We could have saved money with one large checked bag, but I have never flown where carry-ons were not allowed. The airline cancelled our one of our flights and we had to reschedule but trying to do so, I could not pick seats that I had already paid for. This was a big problem and eventually had to call in to have a person fix it but then we could not get seats on a similar flight. I feel ripped off and will avoid United from now on.",-1

TV did not work for the entire duration of the flight. Was told we would arrive to Newark early and when we did, our gate was still occupied so we did not get off the flight until initial time. They did not serve pretzels during breakfast time, but they did serve beer and wine. Seats for economy are extremely small and uncomfortable. Flight time going to Tampa from Newark was delayed by 1 hour and I never received a notification. I only noticed when I looked at the screen in the airport. Going to be looking at different airlines in the future. Only reason I gave a few stars was because staff were friendly.",-1

2021-10-26,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Spokane via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst trip of my life,False,  Worst trip of my life. Flight got changed from flying through Denver to Chicago instead. That was Thursday early evening. Sat in Chicago O’Hare all night until 7 in the morning. Flights kept getting cancelled and I had to drive home in a rental that United agreed to pay for. Now they are saying they will only pay for $150 of the $300 charge. They also told me that they can’t refund my money for the flight because I bought it through a 3rd party.  Never again on United. What a mess they are! So much for my vacation. BTW my luggage went to Spokane without me!!,-1
2021-10-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Memphis to Chicago,,,,,,1.0,1,horrible customer service,True,  United Airlines canceled my flight twice! The first time due to an outage and the second time I did not know until after I arrived at the airport to check in. I was going to my sisters wedding which I was to be a part of. The rep at the service station was a new employee. I told him I needed another flight. He said their are none and nothing they can do. I had to get my mom and aunt on the phone who works for a different airlines told me to put them on speaker. They told the man that they have to get me another ticket even if that means then buying a ticket with another airlines because the cancellation was No fault of my own. He went to talk to a senior worker and a manager over a period of 30 mins to get help to find a ticket. They took forever to come help him. My aunt found me a flight to catch with delta in 1hr and 30 mins. When the mgr finally came out he helped another person that was standing behind me before even acknowledging my situation and finally getting me the ticket. That cost me the whole day I missed to spend with family day before the wedding. After that whole ordeal that had me fearful and stressed that I might miss my sisters wedding I was never given an apology and they sent an email issuing a $100 credit toward another flight. There is no way I am flying another United flight after how I was treated. Outage is a fluke that could happen but the disrespect and unprofessionalism is intolerable. They could have send me $100 Visa card and it still would not have made up the horrible customer service that was given to me.,-1
2021-10-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Detroit,4.0,,4.0,,,4.0,1,Worst experience ever,False,"  I am very very disappointed. I have been using United airlines lately, but I am thinking not to use it anymore in the future after today’s experience. I still have another flight scheduled for next weekend, however, it might be the last one. They postponed my flight for today until tomorrow morning because the crew needs to rest. I will get to work very late tomorrow if they don’t postpone the flight again. They gave us America’s best value Inn Motel. It is horrible, smelly and it looks like that they have not change the bed sheets. This is unacceptable. I can’t stay here.

On my first flight CMH at 12;45pm oct 22 i saw the gate agent didn’t put my luggage on my flight. Which i figured maybe wouldn’t fit/ full flight since there were other bags as well around mine. I had an almost 2 hours layover in Washington i was of course checking my app about my luggage, which showed me it was still not scanned from CMH. Ii asked the gate argent before boarding at 5pm to make sure my bag is here. She verified that she sees my bag here in IAD. I boarded my flight and before i left i asked the stewardess since i still didn’t see my bag update to let me check with their bag agent. She took me to him and he “verified “ over the radio for me that they loaded my bag on my flight and sometimes the app doesn’t update quick enough. I arrived to MUC next day i had a 3 hours layover and at 12:45 pm oct 23 arrived at my final destination to BUD where suprisingly i did not have my luggage anywhere. I went to to file a claim and they looking at the system and telling me that they scanned my bag from CMH TO EWR! And that is the only scan since oct 22 12:45 pm. Which by the way the app shows as well now. The only email i gotten is from Lufthansa not even united that they’re sorry that they lost my bag, and i can check on their website .. and that’s it. Not even the slightest update or a call from united. The worst food possible and not even serving alcohol on international flight even when i asked for purchase. 6am Sunday still not heard from my bag or anyone. My united app told me that i do not require any covid testing/vax proof for my trip. I called united customer service to verify with them to double check. Agent over the phone confirmed that my country does not requiring me since i am a national of Hungary so i am exempt. Great (however and i guess luckily i did a test prior.) Cmh nobody asked me anything. Iad there is a gate announcement that whoever boarding pass doesn’t say verified by united on it they have to stop at the gate counter. I walk up to the lady who told me that my bag was there, and she’s asking me for my covid test. I say united and my app told me that i am exempt and i don’t need one. She rudely looks at me and telling me that “my screen is telling me that you do!”. I just quietly handed over my test result. This was my last trip with your company.",-1

Worst costumer service I’ve experienced from any airlines I’ve ever traveled with. From buying my tickets online to checking in at the airport to boarding the plane, every single person who works for the company shows how completely awful the whole company is and treats them and their customers.",-1
2021-10-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hayden to Columbus,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1,delayed 2 to 3 hours,False,  Last time we flew United over the summer there was a cabin pressure issue they delayed us 16 hours we had to spend the night in Kansas City airport which was not even opened when we got there. They offered us $75 for our time and trouble. We went to leave yesterday from the same airport on the same airline The flight was canceled and we were offered nothing we are now here at the airport again the flight has been delayed 2 to 3 hours and we are not sure if we will make our flight today. United has no concern for her customers time horrible airline! American offered us $1200 a piece for a two hour delay that was voluntary this past year I would highly advise flying American.,-1
2021-10-19,0.4,Family Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to London,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3,food was the worst I have seen,False,"  I was excited to take my first transatlantic flight for over 18 months. A few weeks ago I traveled in United's Polaris Class from SFO to London (LHR) with two other members of my family. When booking the flights, the booking agents confirmed I would be in the new Polaris product with the Suites.  The outbound flight used United's old business class cabin which hadn't changed layout and seats (with the exception of some nice amenities). On the return flight, the plane had the new Polaris cabin which was great. United flies the 787-9 on this route. Many of these aircraft have not been updated to the new Polaris cabin. You can check if you are on the new product by looking at the seat map. If the cabin has four seats across you are in the new Polaris cabin. If there are six seats, you have the old business class product. Both ways the service was great from the flight attendants, though there was no personalized greeting once the flight was underway (an easy fix). The food was the worst I have seen across 20+ years of traveling in business class especially when spending almost $9000 in tickets. As an example, on the way back for the pre arrival meal, they served what was called ""hamburger wellington"" a dry hamburger with processed cheese and some kind of bread or pastry around it (see picture). Dinner was disappointing. I chose the beef which was over cooked and bore little similarity to what was described on the menu. Desert was a small tub of ice cream. The cabin staff who served seemed embarrassed and apologetic when I brought up the food quality suggesting cost cuts and COVID. There was no other food served during the flight between the 2 main meals so we went hungry. In summary, if you fly out of the US internationally and your equipment is a 797-9, you may not fly in the new cabin with the suites. It seems like the booking agents are unaware of the difference between the two business class products and you may be told you are flying in the new suites when you are not. At least I flew one way in the new product, but only because the equipment was changed at the last minute. When I booked the flight, it was a priority for me to travel both ways in the new product. If food is important to you as part of your flying experience, I would definitely advise looking at other carriers. If it's not a priority, I would advise bringing your own food or eating beforehand. In terms of alternatives to the UK from SFO take a look at British Airways and Virgin. You won't regret it. I did contact United about the food in particular (the CEO and his Executive Assistant) to get feedback from the Company and left my phone number. After a few weeks I was sent what looked like an email based on a standard template which did not specifically address my concerns.",-1
2021-10-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Delhi to San Francisco,,,,,,,1, I will never ever use them again,False,  I cant believe an established carrier with such a large operation cannot carry out a basic process of booking and issuing a confirmed ticket. I reserved through their website united.com and received the confirmation the same day. After 3 days went to update things like meal preferences and find out my itinerary doesnt even come up. Called them and they are telling that their incompetent Delhi office was unable to confirm the last leg of the journey and summarily cancelled my itinerary and didn't even bother to inform. After spending 1 hr with their useless agent he told me that he cant do anything and I need to call their Delhi office. I will never ever use them again,-1
2021-10-17,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Houston,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Never take the flight credit,False,"  Never take the flight credit (when you cancel and rebook a flight) you will never be able to use it and the value doesn't make sense. The service is bare minimum and there is nothing on board (no tv, no blanket, no pillow etc) you will get a alcohol swab when you arrive but there was old garbage in the pocket of my seat. Had to pick up my luggage and recheck them when switch flight. I give more than 1 star just because the flight atttendants were nice.",-1
2021-10-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Delhi via San Francisco,,,,,,1.0,1,customer service is beyond terrible,True,"  I had the worst experience in my life. I dropped my parents at the airport today (both senior citizens). We arrived 3.5 hours prior to their flight since they were flying from Dallas - San Francisco - Delhi. The united representatives were absolutely terrible towards us. India now needs a health declaration form prior to entire the country and we have been having issues with the website for a few days. Once we got to the airport we were instructed to fill the form on our cellphones to get our boarding passes. I understand rules and I understand that this is a requirement. However, the website was not working and kept giving us errors while uploading the documents necessary. We tried to fill the form for 2.5 hours and the representatives offered no help at all. When we approached them they would either not make eye contact. Disregard us completely. Say “well, keep trying”. Give us the most idiotic response for a technical issue by saying “keep filling the form over and over again” I cannot begin to express the lack of empathy, consideration and support they had towards my family. We did not ask them to make an “exception” we simply asked for assistance. Midst an anxiety attack they had the audacity to say to me “well, too bad, you'll just need to rebook” It took me almost 3 hours, 27 tries and 0 help from the staff to get the “form” they needed. My parents had under 45 minutes to go through security and make it. This kind of customer service is beyond terrible and your lack of empathy and help is honestly disgusting. Never flying with you again",-1
2021-10-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Montego Bay,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,the worst airline experience,True,"  The worst customer service. I booked for a a round trip flight to Jamaica October 12-October 16th - my October 12 flight was canceled so I decided to leave my return flight as Is, but book the cancelled flight through another company. This lead to United accidentally cancelling both my going and return flights. When I went to check in the day before leaving Jamaica I found this information out. I called to rectify the situation and I was on transferred hung up on and on hold from 4-10pm. They offered me a credit but because I booked through a travel agency I would need to call then to confirm the credit. The issue was the travel agency I used was closed and wouldn’t open back up until after my schedule flight which was less the 24hours away. This is the worst airline experience I ever had",-1
2021-10-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Chicago,3.0,3.0,5.0,,,2.0,1,disappointed in the service,True," Very disappointed in the service. My flight changed 4 times due to a delay from another aircraft. Which I can understand. However my 9:15 flight was delayed till midnight , then another 30 minutes went by because they wanted to load the plane with other passengers. That rubbed me the wrong way. 4 hour delay and you make us wait longer for a more profitable flight? None of the other options they sent worked as I was there for 24 hours for a wedding. I expected to be taken care of in some way even some sort of “I’m sorry this happened and the way you were treated” but I got nothing but excuses. I was out a day in my hotel, car rental as they closed plus the added taxi. More importantly I was out family time.",-1
2021-10-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Puerto Vallarta,,,,,,,2,poor customer service,False,"  I booked a flight with United Airlines back in 2020 for a trip to Mexico that got cancelled due to COVID and was told only half the ticket would be charged instead the full amount was. Trying to reuse the ETC that I was given instead of my original tendered payment should have been the first sign. However, I was forced to pay the difference between the underfunded amount the new ticket cost. Fast forward to September 30 I logged on to check my flight time only to find an issue with my tickets - a big issue, like they have canceled my wife and I's ticket. To make matters worse, they never called and I was forced to fly with another airline but the cost was sufficiently higher and United Airlines refused to cover the difference even though it was there fault. They quit providing customer service because altogether they owe me Over $800 that I will never see. My advice is to fellow air travelers is to fly with another, especially after the poor customer service that was received.",-1

I then talked to quite a few United agents and long story short the last United agent I talked to was Michelle (who boarded us to Knoxville) and she was super friendly and helpful and went out of her way to help me. Thank you again Michelle, you really changed my attitude towards United in a positive way!",1

I spoke with airline they said all is okay and I can make my way to airport, At airport I came to know that I will have to make a payment for new ESTA, I made payment and before I could receive approval my flight was departed, and that’s where my worry started, I was told to call agent to make a new reservation instead I called airline and spoke with lady, she was very kind and airline policy was very relaxed she told me three will be no charge for new reservation, I waited for ESTA to approve, it was approved and called airline again, this time I spoke with man, he understood my situation he booked me on afternoon flight and I boarded on plane and still I am Enroute to my destination. In flight experience was great. I just wanted to say thank you to airline for this kind gesture I was expecting to pay around £500 for same day flight, United saved my plan.",1
2021-10-12,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Phoenix,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,5.0,2,movies had commercials,True,"  We’ve been trained to expect flying for four or five hours cramped, sitting with our knees tight against seat in front, squeezing in and out to get up, and pushing and grunting past others in the aisle. On my Oct 11 flight from Newark to Phoenix, they reached another low: movies had commercials. Furthermore, during an exciting scene in a Star Trek movie, a stewardess announced a sale on Hawaii trips over all entertainment, giving it the priority of flight instructions. You’ve sunk that low?",1
2021-10-12,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Pensacola via Washington,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,Highly disappointed,True,"  We were scheduled to fly out of Columbus on 9/11/2021 at 8:05ish. We arrived at the airport at 6:00am, plenty of time or so we thought. We got in line to check our one bag. There was probably 8 people ahead of us, two lines were going at the same time. Well, I guess we chose the wrong lane along with 8 other people. Our attendant kept taking other people ahead of us and we all missed our flight. We didn’t get our bag checked in time because someone on a later flight was checking literally 16 huge bags. Once our flight left, along with our children (they were in the other line), we were told to wait and someone would get us on another flight. Finally we were put on another flight that now was to leave at 2:00pm and arrive in Pensacola at 7:00 with a 3 hour layover in Washington DC. Our kids would have to wait at the airport for 6 hours. I went to the counter to check our bag at 10am, only to be told that our flight had been cancelled because there we no attendants. I asked what I should do because my kids were going to be in Pensacola in 3 hours without us and no where to stay and no where to go. The attendant at the counter switched us to a Delta flight that left in 45 minutes, but it would get us to Pensacola an hour after our kids got there. So, we checked our bag and ran to the gate, after having to pay again for checking a bag, but that was the least of my worries at that point. Thank God we were able to do it. We had a layover at Atlanta, we were able to make our next flight because we literally ran from A concourse to C concourse, Not an easy feat for this lady. But we made it and made it to Pensacola at 2:pm. All I can say is the morning ticket/baggage attendants in Columbus need to be retrained on their job or fired. Highly disappointed.",-1

I boarded 2 flights in the same day, no one asked if you have kid you can go inside first where other airlines provide this facility. At the end moment they are saying no space for cabin bag. I have a wheeled cabin bag where I had all important documents, they forced us to check in that bag. We told we can’t as it is very important to us if it will be missed we can go for visa interview and we need to travel internationally for 40 hours. The staff said it’s your choice, you gonna miss your flight if you do not check in the luggage. I already had laptop bag which has 3 laptops inside of 7 kg with that I emptied the documents bag which is again of 7 kg. I carried 14 kg luggage all the way of my approximately 40 hours journey and the empty bag they checked in which was completely useless for me what I specially bought for documents before the travel.There is high chance your checkin bag may get delayed or get missed ,how can we keep our important docs there?",-1

United put me on a later flight, in a middle seat. They would not  help switch my seat, neither at the gate nor when I was on the aircraft. They also made me check my carry-on luggage!

2021-10-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Roanoke to Orlando via Washington,,,,,,1.0,1,I will never use them again,True,"  I booked a flight from Roanoke Virginia to Orlando Florida to go the the funeral of a close friend who was like a father to me. When I arrived approximately 90 minutes before departure time I was informed that my flight had been cancelled and that they had taken the liberty of putting me on a different flight that was leaving the next morning and heading to Chicago and then had me landing in Orlando 2-3 hours after the funeral was over. I received emails from the time I booked the flight all the way until after the flight was scheduled to land about a variety of subjects but nothing about a cancellation. When I was at the airport staff informed me that several flights from that airport to Orlando left that day and if I had been informed I could have booked another flight and made the funeral. So after several attempts to reach customer care on the phone to no avail, I sent an email explaining my issues, and after two weeks they returned my email and basically said sorry and heres 75 dollar credit on your next flight with United airlines. That credit will sit there forever because I will never use them again. I would rate them in negative numbers if it would let me. Definitely don’t deserve the 1 minimum rating that your system makes me give them",-1

2021-10-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Vegas,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I am highly disappointed in the company,True," Purchased tickets pre covid which ended up being canceled. We had to pay additional $400 for our tickets to keep our credit even though it was a pandemic. This year we rebooked our tickets paying $3000 more which is being canceled again due to covid. We have no option to keep as a credit unless we pay more money. We are already in this trip $6000. Why do we need to pay more to keep the credit we paid for if we can't fly because of a pandemic happening. This was not a personal choice. I am highly disappointed in the company for not seeing this pandemic happening and understanding the situation we face today. Our tickets were canceled, only getting a measly $2000 back after we paid $6000 and now it takes 3 months to receive the refund. Such a waste of money and time. We even purchased insurance on the original tickets which did nothing and didn't protect us one bit.",-1

I sent them a chronological history of my issue for them to review. Basically United cancelled the second leg of my flight in Aug from Dulles to Fort Myers and rebooked me on another flight from Chicago to Fort Myers however the flight they selected was not going to work so I called and talked to an agent. I found another flight that worked however the agent told me that he could not book me on the Economy Plus seats I already paid for but would have to put me in first class and the price was $805 per person. I had no choice but to book the ticket as the flight was 2 days later and I needed to get home. The interesting thing is that on the first leg of the trip from Portland to Chicago I upgraded to first class and it was $329 per person so the cost went up 2x plus and United had cancelled my flight not me. When we got on the flight there were numerous open seats in Economy Plus and Economy so not sure why he couldn't book me in one of those classes. I have posted on Face Book, Linkedin etc but still no reply and they won't provide me a telephone number for Customer Care.",-1

I paid Business for this trip, after 2 hours waiting for some technical issues: they cancel the flight. No worries a new aircraft is coming, 3 hours later (I already lost my connections) boarded again, second aircraft also had technical problems, 2 hours later cancelled this one. If you ran you can get another flight, so ran and get a beautiful Economy seat, arrive to Houston 9 hours later, we only have economy seats for you tomorrow. but I paid Business, yes but.

2021-09-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Miami,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,a very disorganized airline,False,"  My girlfriend and I had booked through Expedia with United a trip in December of 2020 which we canceled. We got the option of rebooking, which we did on September 12 of 2021 when we booked a one way flight from Newark Int. Airport to Miami Int. Airport using the credit we had (the flight was scheduled for September 19th). At the time of booking the flight the tickets where between $ 100 and $ 150 for each, and we had enough credit for the tickets so nothing extra was charged to us. We even got an email with the confirmation number for the flight and everything was normal until then. However, on the 19th, we were not able to check in online due to a ""missing payment"", which we had no clue about it, we never get notified about a charge. After calling many time and spoken with a United agent, we were told to pay an extra $460 for each of us if we wanted to flight on our same flight, otherwise we had to wait until the next day. Although we did not want to pay that huge amount of money, we end up paying it because we needed to travel that day. United Airlines charged us the tickets as if we were buying it the 19th, at that huge price, even when we got it a week before and got an email confirmation with not charge. The story didn’t end there, after paying it and getting to Newark’s airport, we get notified at the gate that the flight was overbooked, so we had to wait for 2 volunteers in order for us to get on board, we were the last two persons to get on board. It was our first time flying with United and we are not willing to do it again, it was our worst experience at an airport.

Changing to a more reasonable flight cost me an additional $125, and means my wife will have to drive an additional 90 miles to a regional airport to pick me up.

We planned this flight 3 months in advance and when we got on the plane they said there was a technical issue with the planes breaks. It ended up delaying our flight for two hours which lead us to miss all our connecting flights. When we got there they would not let us switch to a different airline to get to our destination on time. We are not staying at the airport on standby until the next available flight which is not until the next day.

This would not work out for me and my schedule. I cancel on the same day just a few hours after I booked and rebook with another airline because United did not have any other suitable timeframe for that day. 1) The 24-hour timeframe begins at the time you book and ticket your reservation. 2) Requests for refunds will be credited back in the original form of payment, I paid with a credit card and to this day have not received a refund. After reading d.o.t. website I noticed they [United] are notorious for dodging and avoiding penalties. I received an automated response stating the refund would pay out via the method used after 7 days. Check my account and no refund after 7 business days. I proceeded to wait another day, then did another form filled out for refund request and waited 14 days again! Their response is that 'we show your ticket has been voided and show that your credit card is not charged"", I should contact my credit card company to resolve this and the receipt I got from them clearly shows it was purchased and paid for. This has to stop now. Policies are there for a reason and if we follow them, then no doubt the airline should honor there end of the policy.",-1
2021-09-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"United used to be a great airline, they have since fallen from this",True," United used to be a great airline, they have since fallen from this. I have flown United for 10+ years and never have I ever had service this bad. My first flight was from Eugene Or to San Fran. It was going to leave around 6, after some complications to the plane we waited for about 8 hours before they canceled our flight. Before the cancelation they repeatedly told us they had a plane coming from Portland to do the flight for us. I thought that was great and knew United would take care of us. After another 3 hours of waiting I heard a few of the crew members behind the desk saying the pilot didn’t want to make the flight and then announced it was canceled. After a headache rebooking my tickets I finally got to SLC. Flying home didn’t start out great either after checking my first bag I went through security with my carry on back pack and carry on, no problem I had flown with United with these exact 2 bags for years no problem. Then boarding came and the lady approving tickets was screaming at me saying that I couldn’t board with my carry on, I assured her that it fit in the requirements of a carry on and offered to re-measure the carry on she insulted me said I couldn’t not board until I paid for a second checked bag all while 3-5 passengers boarded with significantly larger carry-ons boarded and had their luggage stored in the bins with room to spare. I had to pay an extra fee to board. Will never fly with them again.",-1
2021-09-14,0.6,Couple Leisure,Business Class,"Barcelona to Washington, DC via Newark",5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,5.0,5,you would think there would be some minimal staff quality control,False,"  My first review. We, my husband and I, have flown UA for 20+ years because it goes where we want to go and we get a heap of points using our credit card. We fly business or first class most of the time. (Don't be judgmental because we fly this way from wise spending and planning way ahead!) This review is about this particular flight, including the trip over to our destination, which also is analogous to flights we've had in the past. We've discovered UA's terminology for United Polaris business is that the airplane was reconfigured to take out first class to jam as many business class passengers in as possible without increasing staffing. We routinely find business class is staffed by the most surly, unfriendly and curt people. We can compare this to Turkish Airlines or Lufthansa Airlines which are all-but overboard friendly. Considering the dollar or points amount required to fly in business, you would think there would be some minimal staff quality control. Reviewing just the return leg, the attendant had the look of someone who'd rather be recovering from Covid than attending people. No eye contact and brief uncomfortable dialogue. This guy served dinner and picked up after, but was completely out of sight until 8 hours later and another meal was served. I mean no drink cart, no ""do you want a water"", or literally anything else. Nothing. So our calculations had him working about 2 hours out of an 8+ hour flight. Lazy or not doing his job we don't know. We may fly Star Alliance, but will do everything to avoid a United flight again. We're even fed up enough to change credit cards.",-1

I think United workers hate their jobs and are extremely rude and unhelpful. United has the absolute worst customer service I’ve experienced. When my flight was delayed I couldn’t find anyone able to help and I sat on my phone in the airport on hold for hours to rebook - I could continue, but I would never choose to fly United unless I absolutely have no other choice!",-1
2021-09-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Colorado Springs to Detroit via Chicago,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Will never fly United again,False,"  Awful airline! That is if you are like me and don’t like to sit at an airport for no reason and wear a mask. My flight was at 6:17 am at COS. I arrived at the check in for United Airlines at 5:40 am. They told me I needed to check in 30 mins prior to departure. It was 37 mins. The staff at the counter had no answer when I brought this up. As always I got through security and to the gate quickly. I got there by 6:00 am, before group 4 and 5 had boarded. I tried talking to the person at the front boarding gate after the they boarded but they said they couldn’t add me back. Never had an issue like this before. Will never fly United again.",-1
2021-09-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,initially refused to rebook his tickets,False,"  My 13 son who has a service dog has traveled with her on Frontier and Southwest multiple times with no problems. She is a extraordinarily well trained and well behaved dog. We list her on his ticket. When they arrived the flight agent claimed to have no record of her on his ticket, then tried to have us produce certification paperwork, then tried to claim that she was legally required to be wearing a service dog vest. They managed to delay them so long that the flight left without them and they had to be rebooked on their initial and connecting flights. Not only that, but they initially refused to rebook his tickets and only did so after calls were made to higher up management. If you do elect to travel United with service dog, call in and speak to an agent and get them to send you and email confirming your service dog is a passenger and all paperwork is taken care of.",-1

You are literally packed in like sardines into the aircraft. First class looks like a reasonable amount of room, but why should I pay extra for reasonable amount of space? It’s very hot in every plane and my back hurts terribly every time I have to fly. It really sucks flying with United.",-1
2021-09-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Wichita, KS to Houston, TX",3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1,This is the last time I’ll fly with United if I can help it,False,"  Flight 6260 from Wichita to Houston, September 8, 2021. My family and I were sitting in rows eight and seven. Up comes this father with his four year old son. “You’re in our seats.” “Are you sure?” I compared our boarding passes. United Airlines had printed our boarding passes with the same seat numbers (8a and 8b). Well, I didn’t move. United Airlines kicked the man and his four year old son off the plane. Then the man’s four year old son began crying. That’s when you know the stinky stuff has hit the fan. United only let the man and his son back on when I pointed out two open seats nearby. All that wouldn’t have been so bad except we’d all had our original flights canceled by United Airlines the day before and had to spend an extra night in Wichita. Pure pandemonium. And lots of $$$ we couldn’t afford. I asked about compensation but no one listened to me. Missed a whole day of work and wasted another day traveling. At the connecting flight, no wheelchair assist came for my handicapped mother, and I was scolded by a United rep. for not having left my mother on the plane. What was I supposed to do? Leave my mother on the plane and go to my connecting flight? Negative, Ghostrider. Wheelchair assist should be there when the handicapped person gets off. This is the last time I’ll fly with United if I can help it. Delta was a lot nicer. United needs to get their act together.",-1

United repeatedly changed flight times without any notice. We flew Polaris and the food was inedible and carelessly served. Routine requests for coffee or drinks were refused. Boarding was chaotic and our Polaris status made no difference. With $7000 Polaris tickets we were still charged for Wifi. Some non American passengers were incredulous that the service was so deficient especially compared to their other airline experiences.,-1

When I tried to speak to someone at San Francisco international about the issue, she then lied to me and told me they do not have a customer service department, and that they are no refunds given for cancelled flights, ever. I then went to ask another customer service rep how that was possible, and she informed me that was a lie, and directed me to a form I could fill out and wait 14-21 days for a phone call from an accountant to calculate compensation. When I went to file a complaint about this employee, I was told they don’t have a physical customer service department, nor a phone number for one, and that it’s just an accountant that calculates refunds at “customer care”. I then went to file a complaint with the BBB, but United is not accredited.  Stay away and fly another airline.",-1

From the very beginning, when my son’s carry-on item was dismissed as luggage and I had to pay an additional $35 for his small bag, to the fact that we were prevented from using the restrooms when we needed to and disembarking only to have no one willing to help us make it to the next gate via golf cart, and having our luggage lost, I have honestly never had such a poor experience with an airline. When I went to the customer service kiosk for assistance, there was no sympathy or reassurances made. Terrible customer service, and poor to indifferent attitudes by both of the women behind the counter. Also, the coffee was very weak, the customer service of the stewardesses was subpar, and generally, bad.",-1
2021-09-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to San Francisco,,,,,,,1,automatically cancelled my ticket,False,"  Booked a flight with United to go to Hawaii in March 2020. It was cancelled due to the beginning of COVID shut down. They wouldn't give refund, only credit. As of today September 2021, I used my credit and upgraded to first class for an extra $135. The airline automatically cancelled my ticket due to over booking. Called within 24 hours to cancel as per their policy. Now they are refusing to refund cash back, the only thing they will do is credit more on this stupid account. And they have to audacity to say better use by 2022 or you'll lose your credit.",-1
2021-09-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,Newark to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline experience,False,"  Have been traveling at least once a month for years and this is by far the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. When I originally booked first class I was shown that I was booking lay-flat seats, the same I came in on my United as I arrived to Newark from Miami. When I checked in I saw that they are regular business seats (slightly larger than economy), somehow there was a change that I wasn’t informed about. Although I was group 1 and first class I had to put my bags in economy further back as the ones above our seats were taken. Upon arriving my tray is simply taped shut with an “inoperative” sticker and is non existent so I’m unable to drink or eat anything (in first class). My wife had a purse that she brought on her lap on the trip from Miami but now on the return flight was told it too had to be stowed away. We asked the flight attendant who told us we had to put it away where we should put it and she told us she didn’t know but that we couldn’t keep it with us during take off and that we had to go find a place… so once again had to go put it away in economy but by now even further back. There is no TV monitor nor entertainment of any kind and although there are USB and electrical outlets to charge, none of them are functioning. I did book a 9PM flight but I’m shocked at how rude the flight attendant was especially considering it is first class. Will definitely be disputing, worst airline experience I’ve ever had.",-1

They don't inform you about the ESTA procedure, they let you book tickets even though you cannot travel, they are absolutely disorganized never seen such a mess in my life and I am from Greece! Our flight was cancelled due their technical problems, then due to weather conditions we had to sleep in the airport on the floor for two nights. We finally arrived in Athens and they have lost are baggage too! I would never fly with this airline again. And in general I would never fly through the states.",-1
2021-09-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Albany,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,choose any airline over United,True," Purchased round trip tickets to Albany NY from Charlotte NC to visit my mother before covid gets any worse. She has 2 primary cancers. Both trips have layover/connecting flights in Washington D.C. At the gate the United employee tells us some of us can't fly because the flight is overbooked. I was lucky enough to have a seat. A line quickly forms with people unable to board the flight because they overbooked so many seats. First flight to Washington is delayed because there wasn't crew to fly out. I end up missing my connecting flight to Albany. I wait in line for hours just for the CS team to tell me the best they can do is fly me up there 24hrs later. I'm left in an airport to sleep in a cold hard chair. I am on the phone with United and Priceline until 4am when they put me on hold indefinitely. United refuses to refund me so I can purchase a ticket with a different airline to see my mother. I purchased one anyway. 3 days later I'm due to return. United decided to cancel my return flight without asking or letting me know. I fight for hours to get the ticket back. The flight is delayed again. I buy a new ticket with a different airline again. United CS informs me that they will not issue refunds for tickets nor will they transfer your ticket to another airline if they have any open flights to your destination within that week. Of course, since they don’t assign seats and overbook to an inane level they will always have an “open” flight. You just get to sleep in airports for days and essentially get stranded in random cities. The two airlines I had to last minute book with were Delta and Southwest. Had no troubles with either of them. In fact Southwest went above and beyond to help me out, had beautiful planes, friendly staff, and they even had the middle seats kept empty to help with social distancing. If you’re ever given the choice, choose any airline over United.",-1

2021-09-04,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Seattle,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,United continually lied to us,False,"  This flight was going perfectly fine until we boarded. We get on the plane, then as we are taking our seats are told that the plane is having electrical issues. We then have to wait over an hour stuck in the plane on the tarmac while the pilots try to reset the system. This is unsuccessful so we are all brought off the plane. Once we are back in the terminal, the plan keeps changes and we keep being told to wait for news. Nothing solid comes up until about 2 hours after we board, we are told the issue is fixed! Everyone is excited. Roughly 20 min later we are told, no the plane is not only not fixed but now there is no flight today. The soonest one is the next day at 7am. So it is announced to all that food and hotel will be paid by United. We wait for 20 minutes or so in line to receive the meal/hotel voucher or but then we are told that nothing would be given to those without this as a connecting flight. We got meal vouchers for 20 bucks but only to be spent in the airport at specific locations. This sucked. United continually lied to us and had no back-up plan for any issues.",-1
2021-09-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst experience ever,False,  This is the 3rd time I have been delayed over 3 plus hours No pilots showing up for their job. Then their delay causes us a 3hour delay in which “we make up time in the air” only to sit for another 90 mins at the terminal waiting to exit. So my 3 hour flight has now taking me 7 hours. Boycott this airline Do not spend your money here If your time is valuable and you “planned“ your vacation expect it to be on their time and their agenda. Entire day of my trip wasted and hours upon hours spent wasted in a terminal Or plane. Worst experience ever in life on a plane.,-1

Nobody had an answer in the end I had to speak to a supervisor named Raymond who let me know they would be refunding the $96.20 but it would be a few days now what with that little bit of money tied up whether it was a little bit of change in my pocket or all. I had at the moment that was a Unauthorized transaction by a gentleman who had me on the phone for an hour and still no solution. I talked to another sweet lady after who transferred me to one of the managers who told me I hadn't paid - we paid as I stated earlier. I had no ticket so when I went to search it and asked where it was he asked did you want to still book this. I answered with confusing letting him know I thought it had been booked as I was charged for it. Later on this afternoon around 2 o'clock I get another email from the manager at the airport asking me for my confirmation number which I gave him - he could not find my reservation and the end after 20 minutes of running around answers back don't answers back ""oh I see it you are good to go""!

""because of Covid"", the Polaris lounge is closed, but the cheap, poor food, no showers lounge for the domestic fliers is open. Unbelievable that they sell Polaris lounge as a perk for flying first class and then don't give a damn about delivering that service. Feels like a complete scam United is running again. First not refunding the tickets when Covid hit - until one took legal action - and now the same scammers don't deliver what they sell.",-1

Woke up in the middle of the night with less than 12 hours until my flight being notified of it's cancellation. Took a live agent 2.5 hours to look for a new option, so I decided to look into it myself, and then took him an additional hour to approve it. Upon my arrival at the airport, I was rerouted once more without even knowing. I had figured this out by speaking to an agent. And then once again I was rerouted, because every flight to my destination was being cancelled, only by united. I cancelled the trip and can't wait for my refund.

Premiere Platinum check in only by machines which can only be operated by attendants and the wait is at least 45 minutes of people pushing, jostling and not maintaining social distance. The agent was incapable of understanding the Timatic regulations for South Africa and Zambia that the computer returned. The gate agent refused to allow boarding for those who had not filled out the South African health questionaire (which is not a requirement) and ultimately UA handed out the form-- the wrong form. Of course it was available on the plane and on arrival at JNB. The crew EWR-JNB was matter of fact and preferred conversing with themselves over helping passengers. UA is still not taking special meals and vegetarian options were sparce. The meal was coach quality. The return JNB-EWR meal was at least not under plastic but still inadequate for business class. The Polaris seat is far less comfortable than the prior business class seat.Transfer at JNB on the return from LUN was chaotic since the agent at the transfer desk took 10 minutes to figure out how to log into his computer. I had flown EWR-BRU and JNB-EWR in June on UA and it was just as bad in every regard from check in to in flight service. UA really needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.",-1

2021-09-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1,Very bad experience,True,"  Very bad experience. At the airport in Frankfurt we needed to go trough some additional and very disorganized additional screening which no one was informing passengers until at the gate. I was flying with connecting flight and no info given as well as no info was given when I checked in my bags at the airport that this has to be done. So I had to walk back pretty far just to be asked the exact same type of questions we are always asked at the customs and pre boarding. As usual there was always few people who were completely unaware and turned away while boarding. Other than flight being delayed while boarding the security put people in 3 huge lines just to make them stand in those lines for additional 20-30 min for no reason rather than just start gather people at the moment they are about to board the flight. Then while boarding yet again the same type of checking passports just to scan then anyways like every other airline and the scanner got locked out. So the whole situation ended up being the staff yelling and annoying the super disoriented people right before 9hr flight in very confined space. Food was absolutely horrible, I fly quite often with multiple airlines and I have never in my life been served such horrible food on the long flight and I flew with some airlines that don’t even exist anymore. Staff politeness also wasn’t at it’s best. The only thing is that seats were somehow comfortable as for the economy class",-1

They refused to assist me. Later I asked them if I could leave my trolley bag for few minutes and come back for it after adjusting my other luggage, they declined my request .A fellow passenger helped me with my trolley bag. They said all passengers were responsible for their own luggage, my baby was very restless and had I not been helpless I would never have asked for help. All I wanted was a cabin crew who could drag my trolley bag until my seat because my hands were engaged. The cabin crew members were very indifferent and rude. I will never fly with UA again.

However for some reason I forgot this, and have been slighted a second time, when a plane was delayed missing the connecting flight due to their error, no hotel voucher was offered, no refund was offered, no food was offered, and we had to wait another 16 hours for a flight all at the very last minute.

Firstly we flew into Jamaica on American Airlines. American did not charge for carryon on an international flight. I read about carryon and the 5 children we were traveling with carryon was well within specification but I guess it’s everyone fault that passengers must be subjected to disgruntled employees of United Airlines in Jamaica. We paid $90 for checked bags and just because they want to give us a hard time gonna tell us to pay $30 x 5 additional bags. I explained we were not aware of this extra cost and we are in no position to pay. I pull down my mask to speak and she let me know. “Do not speak to her without my mask covering.”   No customer service at all offering any solutions because our checked bags wasn’t overweight so my husband quickly thought we are going to take out the kids clothes and spread it through the 3 checked. The agent suggested she damage the kids suitcase that was her solution. The supervisor  walks us over to a station to see if the kids carryon fits in the overhead which it did and told us no it doesn’t that the carryon need to fit horizontally. Looking perplexed and feeling disgusted, we worked feverishly to pack the suitcase and discard the suitcases. Then to add insult to injury the agent wants to charge for overweight of 2-3 ounces, the supervisors had to advise to let them go. The employees of United Airlines are unprofessional! So because we were on basic economy United Airlines wants to turn families upside down and inconvenience people to make them pay more to select seating. It was eight of us traveling and everyone was separated our 3 year old was placed alone. All in a scheme to us to pay to sit together that should be illegal. The airline is a disgrace.",-1

I hear all they want is to break guitars and break my guitar is what they did. It was a 300$ C.I (Grand Cayman money) so almost 400$ usd made a claim and got ignored. Finally got contacted back with a 100$ United airline credit, that I did not use or even think about using. Never again will I fly with UA and recommend that you don’t either.",-1
2021-08-27,0.2,Family Leisure,Business Class,Salt Lake City to Chicago,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,3,I will choose a different airline,False,"  If I ever have another choice, I will choose a different airline. For this particular trip, our flights were booked through Swiss Air, but our first flight of the day was operated by United. United does not have Curbside Check-in, and we are moving to another country for 2 years, so we have the maximum allowed baggage (2 carry on and 2 checked under 32 kg -- based on Swiss Air's rules). The guy at the counter told us we had to have a negative test result before we could get a boarding pass but the location of the Xprescheck (where we scheduled to get our tests) is in the terminal, so you have to have a boarding pass to enter. He finally decided it was okay to use our vaccination cards. Our bag was two pounds over. He said it would be $400 per bag that was over.  We repacked to make sure each bag was under weight.  Your flight was delayed twice, so you're going to miss your connection in Chicago, even though you had a three hour layover. We'll rebook your flights for you.  The only flight he could find was the next day with 2 of us in Business Class and three of us in Economy for the first leg of the flight (basically any portion operated by United). But they don't offer to refund the difference between the price we paid for everyone to have Business Class nor do they offer any kind of assistance (like a hotel stay since it was their fault or even a free meal service)? Nothing. It's just our bad luck that we flew with United.  Went back to a hotel to wait for tomorrow's flight. Took a one hour COVID test at a new location so we could check in online, but we still can't because even with the negative results uploaded in their system, they won't let us check in without looking at our passports. So I have three little kids that I can't check seats to make sure they are sitting somewhere near me and I can't check in online to let them know how much baggage we have. I took the exact same trip through Delta a month ago and it was entirely smooth sailing. If they have to reschedule your flight, they take the time to pick seats out with you immediately to make sure you are sitting near your children. But with United, we rely on the kindness of other passengers to trade seats with us so that we can sit with our kids. If you want a trouble free flight domestically or internationally, with service personnel who go the extra mile to help you out when they have failed in any part of their performance, you don't want UNITED.",-1

Wasn't allowed to check in online (economy). Got to the gate, had to check in manually, and was informed I had to check my carry on for $35 even with military ID.

2021-08-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Seattle,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3,It just felt unprofessional,True," I have flown with a handful of airlines in the last year and even in the last week and I never had this experience with other airlines. I always fly with a medical bag full of supplies for my health issues. Both at the front desk and before getting on the plane I was questioned about what my medical issues and and about what supplies I really needed. I’m not a very private person so I couldn't care less to share my medical issues or list off the medical supplies I need. But it was a bit uncomfortable as it felt as though they could deem my medical issues sufficient enough for a small backpack or that they just didn’t think I had health issues maybe. I was about to just show my medical tattoo or start pulling out supplies. It just felt unprofessional. I know some people would feel even more uncomfortable so just a fare warning. They also definitely seemed irritated with me, like I’m irritated too. I have to carry this extra stuff around to stay alive all the time. I always go to the front desk/bag check to confirm this is okay since there only so much space on the plane and most airlines willingly accommodate. Often checking one of my carry-ons if they have a shortage of space or the very least just let me carry my extra backpack on. Usually I just say I have a medical bag and then the only question I get asked is if I need it on the flight with me or if they can check it or another bag. I’ve definitely never had to list out what medical supplies I need to keep on my person with any other airline until today. Wasn’t impressed.",-1
2021-08-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Columbia to Bangor via Chicago,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,Absolutely terrible experience,True,"  Absolutely terrible experience from start to finish. Both our outgoing and return flights from a weeklong trip to Maine were heavily delayed. With the outgoing flight, we were told it might be a few hour’s delay…or maybe the flight would be cancelled, they had no clue, so we waited in the airport for hours before finally departing and missing our connecting flight. We went from planning to arrive in Maine around 3pm to arriving after 10pm, which, had we known, we would have booked a hotel near the airport rather than one requiring a two-hour drive. On our return flight, after multiple delays, boarding and deplaning twice, and waiting for hours, the flight was canceled, leaving us scrambling to find a hotel room and a taxi/Lyft in an area where both were very hard to find. So now we’re missing a day of work and paying for another day of hotel/food/transport, and we return to the airport the next day for our rebooked flight. Our flight was supposed to leave Chicago by 7:30pm; it’s now almost midnight and we’re still sitting here, having gotten 5 or 6 time updates and two gate changes. No clue if we’ll actually get to fly out tonight or end up missing yet another day of work and paying for yet another day of travel that we hadn’t planned on. Will do everything in my power to avoid flying with United ever again.",-1

I changed the flight time and they canceled my flight all around (system error) and try to make me pay $62 to reinstate it even though the guy on the phone said that it was an error on United’s side! I have been flying since I was seven years old with Jetblue and I have never experienced something like that, I had to pay over $100 to get my bags to travel, I was boarded onto two broken planes then de-boarded in which then delayed the flight by five hours causing me to miss the wedding I was attending. On the way home they then put us on a broken plane with no AC, another 30 min and de-board us! I have never in my life been on such a bad airline, then when talking to one of your workers then proceeded to give me a terrible attitude telling me that this hasn’t happened in months. I don’t know how many broken planes they have or why customer service is so difficult to get anything done with on the phone. Is this Spirit or what?",-1

Been on planes or in terminal for 2 days in a row. 2 days in a row of planes breaking down. Was stuck on a plane in phoenix yesterday for 7hrs not allowed to unboard for food or bathroom, which caused me to miss the connecting flight in Chicago. United paid for a hotel room, which i had to pay a uber to get to, the. Pay for another uber to get back to airport this morning where the my flight home is broken and I've been sitting here for 4 hours already. I went to customer service to be put on a different flight home and they wont do it because even though its the same airline there is a price difference that they want me to cover even though its their planes that keep breaking down. And they wont pay to put me on a different airline. They have pushed my flight 4 times now. Still sitting in the airport.Will not be using them again!",-1

I purchased a premium economy ticket, according to my seat assignment it was from row 9-15. At the airport when I pulled my tickets out of the machine they were row number 23. Half of the plane was empty, I asked why was I sitting in 23 when I paid for premium. She answered me in a very rude way by saying I don't have any time for discussion and if you want to sit any closer you have to pay an additional fee. This was the worst service I have ever had, I always fly American and very much enjoyed so but I am very disappointed.",-1

On leg from Detroit to Los Angeles: After all passengers boarded aircraft, departure was delayed 55 minutes to wait for potable water to be added to plane’s tanks, despite the plane having been at the gate prior to boarding for well over two hours. Upon arrival in Los Angeles, plane was delayed on tarmac from going to gate for approximately one hour due to lack of gate availability.

It is so silly to see them reconnect the channel after closing the door. Then the plane taxi to runway and waited another hour. Then they say they sent a mechanic to check on bathroom light. Another hour passed, they said the crew are too tired to overwork because the air control would not give them signal to take off yet after running late 4 hours. It will be illegal to let them overwork. Then they dumped us saying there will be a Hurricane in NJ. It is like watching a ridiculous drama this people performed exhausting all kinds of excuses. All customers were mad at that point after midnight when they kicked us out.",-1

A week after I booked I received an email from United saying that my flight from Edmonton was canceled and that I should call to get my options. What was suppose to be a 30 minute hold time, per the recording, turned into 1 hour 20 minutes only to be told that my entire trip was canceled. Was told that I would receive a credit, no refund, even though United was the ones that canceled my trip, not me.

2021-08-20,0.1,Family Leisure,First Class,Newark to Portland,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,check-in was a chaotic mess,False,"  First of all, the app. I was unable to verify the flight because I used the app to get my boarding passes, and after the flight, they disappeared. Now I have no record of them. This was a first class flight but it was as bad as most flights can get. We were delayed for an hour and a half on the tarmac in what were the most uncomfortable seats (my back was actually hurting, and I don't have back pain usually), which would not recline; there was NO entertainment system; and no pillows or blankets, or amenities kit! Even on our recent British Airways premium economy flight we had pillows, blankets, and an amenities kit. The entertainment was called ""personal entertainment"", which meant you have to use your own phone. But my family do not have earbuds that connect to our devices! There was no warning that we would need them! Furthermore, you had to download the United app before takeoff. I had the app, but none of my family did, because we weren't made aware of this! Anyway, the app didn't work--the movies would not come on. And the flight attendants were unable to make them work either. And that is the bottom line. The app's entertainment feature did not work. Also, the check-in was a chaotic mess. People were in line for a long time and grumbling angrily because there were only 2 people behind the counter to assist. It was as bad as an economy check-in can get, except this was supposedly First Class.",-1

Customer service is disrespectful, nobody wants to do their job. Delays with no explanation, takes hours to speak to an agent. This was the only airline that had a flight that would suit our path (that is the ONLY reason I used them). I will never in my life take their airline again. They need to close them down because they do not care about the people in which they serve. Just utterly disgusting United airlines",-1

Started in Fresno flew to Chicago lay over then Chicago to Albany. As we were walking out of the TSA security in Albany I realized I I left my camera and lens in a bag onboard the plane. The TSA would not allow me to go back to the gate because I didn't have a ticket for a flight out of Albany. I then went to baggage claim office and they asked for bag slip I told it was carry on said I had to call, I called they said that I had to go online and fill out a ""LOB"" report, so I did. I have my lost article ID report number, the operator when I talk to them on the phone also told me that they have a procedure that they're supposed to go through so when they go through and clean the airplane as they're supposed to do (which they apparently didn't do) when everybody deplanes they're supposed to take any articles found that were left on board how to the gate attendant the gate attendant is supposed to take it to a secure area inside the baggage claim office area, so I'm just trying to figure out where and who messed up besides myself for leaving it on board. I would like to find out who is the dishonest person who either didn't do their job by cleaning the airplane to find my bag when the only people who were behind me were a middle-aged couple and they had to younger kids probably 10 and 12 years old the only people that got off behind me and they walked off behind me and we're not carrying my camera bag, so I'm trying to figure out which of the people are dishonest either the flight attendant who didn't do his job by cleaning, and then not paying attention in making sure things left on board didn't stay on board, or I hope he found my bag and took it out to the gate person or the gate person who didn't turn it into the baggage claim office person. There are a couple things I would like to say one I understand it to my fault that I left it on board, I apologize I wish somebody else would at least do their job they should have cleaned the guy I keep saying the guy cuz there was only one flight attendant. I mean they do tell you in the pre-boarding that they thoroughly clean the airplane after everyone disembarks and before the new people come on board, during covid come on now.",-1
2021-08-18,0.3,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2,Entirely unacceptable experience,True,"  Entirely unacceptable experience. Yesterdays flight from FRA to ORD was an experience which leaves much room for improvement. The treatment by the cabin crew in Business Class was unacceptable. It ranged from entirely disinterested (young male flight attendant, possibly in training) to outright hostile (senior female). Maybe I made the mistake to push the call button (in order to have my jacket hung in the closet, and later, into the flight, to order a drink) which unloaded some hostility from the female flight attendant. I must have ruined all my chances of good treatment by not putting my mask up immediately between bites which caused her to sprint over to my seat yelling at me.  The food, Economy class quality, was presented without care or skill, wine came in plastic cups. When debarking there was nobody at the door interested in channeling the traffic, economy class disembarked first, nobody cared. As a customer one has literally no choice here, this is a code share situation, my flight from ORD to FRA was with LUFTHANSA, and was better by a great degree, I didn't fly voluntarily on United. What a bad taste this leaves. Disgusting. Shame on United Airlines and your lack of training of your staff.",-1
2021-08-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,a disgusting display of disrespect,False,"  My wife and I were returning to Chicago from Las Vegas. At Las Vegas United baggage check-in, we were unable to check-in via kiosk as we had prepaid for bags and there is no way to print a tag for prepaid baggage (?). We asked the counter girl to help us. She sent us back to kiosk. Asked an older lady to help us. Obviously already annoyed, she tried to check us in on kiosk. I told her we had prepaid for our bags. She asked for a receipt. I produced it. She then proceeded to ask many questions about the receipt. Questioned the date purchased. Questioned our flight to Vegas. I told her we would find another employee to help as she seemed very annoyed and confused. She exploded loudly saying, ""I have worked here 30 years. No one has ever said that to me. You can find someone else to help you!"" Everyone in earshot looked on in shock. I got another employee to help. Shortly after, I sent a complaint to United. As of this date, no response from United. That was a disgusting display of disrespect to someone who helps pay their wages. My wife was almost in tears. That is a poor way to treat a veteran and a Mileage Plus member.",-1
2021-08-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark  to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,5.0,1,obviously not trained properly,True,"  I would like to tell you how I was treated when I entered this flight. I went to my seat that I picked when I booked my flight, 20D. I put my carry on above and sat down. A woman came to my seat and showed me a ticket that said 20D. She said it was her seat and I did not want any friction to happen because of this. So I got up and I told her I would try and figure out what is going on. As I told the flight attendant, she responded with ""Well you shouldn't have gotten up. I don't know what to tell you."" I was completely shocked. I love United and I fly your airline over any whenever I can. She asked me to step in the back, so I did. I asked what was going on and how this could be fixed. The same flight attendant then said ""I don't have time for this, or you. I am not even supposed to be working on this flight."" This conversation really upset me. And it was heard by many travelers. Another flight attendant looked at my ticket and said, ""Look, your seat was changed, look at your ticket."" And she was right. I apologized. Whenever my flight has changed with United, I was told by the professional who gave me my boarding pass to get on the plane. So, I switched to 8D. I went to the seat and the entire row was booked. My anxiety started rising and I felt very uncomfortable on your airline flight. I was spoken down to and disrespected. I made a mistake with the seat. I should have been extra cautious and looked but I didn't because everything seemed perfect until I got on. I told a flight attendant and I was told to look at the empty seats and sit somewhere. Is that how they should respond? As an experienced individual with a mental health diagnosis, I find it so important to always be careful who you speak to with a bad tone.  And flight attendants deserve the same respect. If I had an anxiety attack, I could have been taken off the plane due to health reasons and stuck alone and honestly really scared. My bag was in 20D above and I was maybe at 7 window I believe. I honestly didn't even look. I was just happy to have been able to sit down. After I got off of the plane, I was at the stairs and trying to get my belongings together before I carried my carry on up. There were multiple travelers asking if I needed help and apologizing for being treated the way I was and to not worry, misery loves company. This flight attendant who was not supposed to be working that day is obviously not trained properly. All she did was raise her voice to me and sit on her cell phone in the back not caring I was just standing there with nowhere to go. I don't deserve to be treated in this manner. My family flies United to Aruba 1-2 times a year. I usually do but I have had school and been unable to. I hope the next flight I am on is more positive and helpful. Please address this properly because your customer service handled this terribly and offered no help. I was told my treatment will have to wait 25-30 days hung up.",-1
2021-08-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Jackson Hole,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,The supervisor I spoke to was dismissive and unhelpful,False,"  I’ve grown up flying frequently, and flying United is the absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had from an airline. My terrible experience began when I noticed my family member's first name was on my ticket instead of mine. I called ahead of my flight to change this and even though the ticket had my correct date of birth, my address, and my last name, United employees refused to change the first name, told me I cannot fly, and provided no refund or voucher. The United employee I spoke to on the phone was very rude and hung up on me before I was finished asking questions about the name change. I booked another flight which I had to pay for because the trip I was going on could not be cancelled or postponed. Once on my flight, I witnessed United employees requiring a man who used a wheelchair walk all the way to the back of the plane despite him requesting a closer seat. When several passengers complained about this, the United Flight attendants ignored them and said nothing. The plane I was on had to stay in the air for a full extra hour right outside of Denver International Airport because there was no gate for the plane to land at. Because of that delay, I missed my connecting flight. When I got to the gate I asked the United employee if the flight had already departed and she just shouted “Yep. Customer Service!” And directed me to the other side of the airport where I stood in a line for 2 hours. The line consisted of 100% United customers, showing how many issues the airline was experiencing. After waiting 2 hours in line I was told the next flight out is the next morning and there is no ability for United to provide hotel accommodations for my overnight stay in Denver. The supervisor I spoke to was dismissive and unhelpful and told me “I’ve slept in the airport numerous times. I have other people to help” and walked away before I could respond. I never once received even as much as an apology from United Staff. Needless to say I will never be flying United again, and just wanted to get the word out about how poorly United Customer Service dealt with my flight(s) every step of the way. I am so disappointed with this airline and how they treat their customers, it’s just completely unacceptable.",-1

I'm working on my pilot training and I was enjoying looking at the equipment and the airplane. So we were delayed by weather, it happens. No problem. We were delayed by 5 hours. Had to turn around to DIA. OK, no big deal. Then we are told they are going to refuel, then they aren't, then they say to come off the plane. Then we're told we can leave, we aren't captive ... which got my attention. Then we were informed that we can either wait another 6 hours in the closed airport for the next flight out or we can reschedule. There are parents with kids and elderly folks having to make this decision at 2am. The united staff I interacted with were very nice however, the corporate spokesperson left a lot to be desired. My time is valuable, in the end I didn't feel like that was respected. There are other options they could have offered. For the folks waiting in the concourse for the next 6 hours, I am sorry. I'm glad I can go home and sleep. I'm going to travel internationally this year, there is no way I would want to consider traveling with them based on this experience.",-1
2021-08-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,Newark to Pittsburg,1.0,,1.0,,,4.0,1,worst airline experience ever,True,"  Our worst airline experience ever! There were ten (10) time changes (delayed flight) prior to this flight being cancelled ! At first we trusted that the flight would eventually take place and decided to go to the United Lounge for which we had valid passes. When we got there we were informed that our valid one day passes would not be honored ! This after taking a shuttle bus to a different terminal where the only open United Lounge was located. At this point we had to find another place to eat and relax. After checking luggage and going through security we waited about five hours before we realized that United was playing a game. We felt quite sure this flight would be cancelled at this point so we went to the customer service desk and cancelled our reservation and got a refund ( which takes approximately four days to credit your account!) We then had to go retrieve our luggage. That was the only bright spot in this mess ! It only took about fifteen minutes to get or suitcase back and the ladies at the luggage claim were very helpful. But the damage caused by this poor excuse for a business goes way beyond the flight tickets : $290 for hotel reservation cancelled, $300.00 for Pirates tickets not used, $100.00 for taxi service both ways and a small amount for tickets to the Aviary. Not to mention the cancelled plans ( made well in advance ) with friends ! We will never fly United again. I addition I will be closing my Chase/ United credit card. Also, while waiting at the customer service desk for our turn we had to listen to a very large number of people who had their flights cancelled as well. I have never seen that many angry customers in one place at the same time ! What I would say to United is that we can and will take our business elsewhere in the future. Your airline is not of any value when you obviously are not capable of running it in a professional, forthright fashion. Not so friendly skies at all.",-1

Prior to today’s flight they changed our plane 3 different times and dumped us on a tiny puddle jumper plane that apparently can barely hold enough fuel for a short 1 1/2 flight. I will never fly United again.,-1
2021-08-13,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Philadelphia,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,wanted to say thank you,False,"  I’m not one for writing reviews but I had to do this one. I just wanted to say thank you to the pilots that were flying the United airlines flight 2030 from Denver to Philadelphia on august 5, 2021, you give my 4 years old a wonderful experience. When he left the cockpit and we went to our seats he said mom, it was so nice meeting the pilots. He told everyone around us that he flew the plane. Once again I just wanted to say thank you.",1
2021-08-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Hilton Head,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst travel experience to date,False,"  Woke a 4 am for early flight and paid extra to arrive by noon to make most of a one week vacation. However, told at airport of delay resulting in all day and evening at the airport, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Went to customer service at airport for help only to be told can’t help. So looked up called customer service online and called only to be on hold for 30 minutes then just told to fill out customer care form online. Then we filled out form online as instructed and received an email saying will review in 25-30 days. Must be because so many have had issues and so many to review. Worst travel experience to date with no help or compensation for lost day of vacation and cost of rental care and hotel for the day. A two hour delay is one thing but 9 hours later is ridiculous. Unacceptable United!",-1
2021-08-12,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Nashville,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,I will never fly United again,True,"  I fly relatively frequently for work, vacations, family visits, etc. I usually choose the cheapest flight that coincides with the dates of travel I need. However, I cannot excuse the pattern I've experienced with United Airlines. Again, since I typically choose the cheapest ticket price, I have flown United, Delta, American, Southwest, and Allegiant many, many times. I have experienced a trend with United that I have not experienced with any of the other carriers (including discount Allegiant). I would estimate that 35-40% of the United flights I have bought for the last 10 years have been delayed or canceled. Several times, this has resulted in an inconvenience. For example, my current experience is this: my return flight from Gillette, Wyoming to Denver was delayed by 2 hours. I received two texts that informed me that it had been delayed further. When u finally got to Denver, I had missed my connection flight to Nashville. After I de-planed, I spoke to the attendant at the flight desk. When I asked, he stated that the plane had been delayed due to maintenance and instructed me to go to the customer service desk to get my flight rescheduled and get hotel accommodations. When I did, I was informed by the customer service Manager that they couldn't do anything to help with my hotel. He stated that flight had been delayed by almost 2 hours due to the FAA air traffic control department. I asked him what that meant. He only vaguely explained and reiterated that United Airlines could not help with my hotel room. Therefore, I looked up all the hotels near the denver airport, and wouldn't you know it, they were from $150 - $550 per night. It was only 13 hours since my new flight left, so, I opted to sleep on the floor in the airport. I woke up multiple times, but made my way to the rescheduled flight and boarding time of 7:30 am. When I arrived at gate B60, I found that my flight had been, yet again, delayed over 4 hours due to ""maintenance issues"". I checked priceline to see if another flight could get me home. I found a flight at 10:00. I approached customer service to inquire about that flight. They informed me that flight had been delayed TOO. Therefore, my flight from Gillette to Denver was delayed and rescheduled for the next day. Then, that flight was delayed for over 4 hours. In addition, the two other flight to Nashville were also delayed. In addition to all this, I was beside a guy in the customer service line that had 3 flights delayed in one day. He had his Newark flight, Albany flight, and Denver flight ALL delayed on the same day that my flights were delayed.  I will never fly United again. As a matter of principle, I will pay the higher prices for plane tickets to fly another airline. I have flown Delta and American as frequently as I have flown United without 40%+ of the problems and delays.",-1
2021-08-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Killeen,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Customer Service is very important to a business!,False,"  I purchased a round trip ticket from Tampa, FL to Killeen, TX for travel dates July 29th thru Aug 11, 2020. The first leg of the trip went without any issues. Yesterday Aug 11, I was scheduled to leave on the flight from Killeen, TX to Tampa, FL. with a departure time of 7.10 am. I do have to remind you Killen, TX airport is a very small regional airport and United has 2 flights a day out of there. I know the suggested arrival times at major airports, which is important due to the number of passengers and the distance you might have to walk to your gate. This particular airport the departure gate is almost within sight of the ticket counter. I arrived at the airport 40 minutes prior to my departure. As I enter the building I notice the only agents there are working American Airlines and there is not one person in this area other than myself and the 2 agents working American. I walk up to the counter and they informed me that the United Agents must also work the gates so they close the ticket counter 45 minutes prior to flight time. (There are no self service kiosks in this airport). I proceed up the stairs and approach security. I explain my situation to them and the one gentleman says ""I will take your ID over the the agents at the gate, and I know they will print a ticket for you there, as I have done this before"". He comes back and tells me that they said they would not do this, that I must reschedule. I call United to reschedule for the later flight and the agent on the phone tells me it will cost $238 for a new ticket since I missed my flight. Why? So about 10 minutes later I call again, this time the agent tells me I must buy a new ticket and it is $186. So, why the difference in 10 minutes? I am at this point very upset. I sit down to try to compose myself. I walk down to the American Airlines counter and the 2 agents working there are aware of what is going on with my issue. They were so kind and informed me that this does happen often, but American will rebook your flight for you with no charge as they understand that sometimes there are traffic issues that can hinder your travel times. Once I composed myself I decided that I would not rebook with United, and went to the American Airlines counter and purchased a ticket from them. It was a much better flight and I was scheduled to be home much earlier. I am very upset over this situation and have vowed to never travel United Airlines again. I hope this never happens to anyone else, and I am positive I will never travel United Airlines again. Customer Service is very important to a business!",-1
2021-08-11,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Cancun,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,Stephen deserves to be recognized,False,"  I will forever be grateful for the wonderful customer service that was provided by Stephen Serrano. My husband and I were traveling to Cancun for our honeymoon, and we were running late. Stephen did everything to try to help us get on the plane. We ended up having to take the next flight, but we made it. Stephen made multiple attempts and tried different methods to get us to board (he went above and beyond). We tried to tip him to show our gratitude and he didn't want to accept. He was very patient and kind. I am not one to write a review, but Stephen deserves to be recognized. We had a great time, and it was all thanks to Stephen. Location-IAH (Ticketing area)",1
2021-08-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Atlanta via Houston,1.0,,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst trip ever,True,"  My flight from LAX was 30 minutes late to arrive and take off to Houston. This made me almost miss my connecting flight from Houston to Atlanta. The plane had been sitting on the tarmac for 20 minutes before we moved after landing and I got the text that my connecting flight from Houston was boarding when we landed from LAX in Houston so I had to run across the airport carrying luggage to make my flight right before they closed the door to boarding. I have a physical disability that makes having to run and carry luggage very painful. I was lucky enough to barely make my flight only for my checked bag that I paid for to not show up at the airport. I dealt with the baggage claim office and was told it was still in Houston but would be delivered the next day between 1-6 pm. On the automated service I was told my bag was picked up around 4 pm. Online it apparently wasn’t picked up until 6:05. When I spoke to an agent it was picked up at 6:15. She told me my bag would take 6-8 hours to deliver but they stop residential deliveries after 11pm which means I’ll have to wait another day to have my bag delivered in the morning. I landed on the 9th and will have no baggage until at least the 11th and I leave on the 12th, meaning no clothes, soap, underwear, or toothbrush to use. I have to come out of my own pocket and replace those items so that I can actually have basic hygiene. I don’t even live here, I’m visiting. Additionally you have to wait until you GET YOUR BAG to even request a refund or compensation for anything you had to replace.  I’ll have 1 day with baggage before I have to fly back home. Worst trip ever. Never flying with them again. Terrible seating, terrible service, terrible airline. The only redeeming quality about my flights was the very competent flight attendants.",-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Baltimore,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Charged me $100 for my suitcase,True,  The absolute worst airline. Charged me $100 for my suitcase. Boarded 30 min late just to tell us we have to get off because of technical difficulties. I though that should be checked before we even come on. Then we arrived 20 min later then they said we would. Then had us wait an hour to inboard the plane.,-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Portland,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,They had cancelled my flight,False,"  This is a review on my return flight from Portland to Newark. Arrived at the airport for the return flight on August 10th. They had cancelled my flight and rescheduled me and my husband on a return flight on the 11th without any notification whatsoever. They gave Me three choices; take a bus to Boston ( 2 hour ride), and take another plane home, find a hotel room and fly on a non-direct flight (7 hours instead of an hour and a half) or get a refund( if it goes through corporate). Is this good public relations? And to make matters worse, I have to attend a funeral tomorrow at 12 PM. If you cancel flights, you should take responsibility for getting your customers home in a timely manner.",-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bradley to Chicago O'Hare,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,3,Never using United again,False,  Terrible airline. Made us board and disembark plane three times while waiting on dispatch. When the flight was finally cancelled they staff was zero help in helping me find a new flight and refused to give me a refund. Never using United again.,-1
2021-08-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Cincinnati,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,They just don’t seem to care,False,  I will never fly United again. On August 10th we departed Portland for Cincinnati via O’hare and got grounded in Madison WI overnight due to bad weather. An early morning flight was rescheduled for O’hare and they could not find a pilot so that flight got delayed until 3 pm. Our flight to Cincinnati was rescheduled for 9pm Cincinnati time. We decided to rent a car to drive home from O’hare since we have no faith in United. We will arrive home an entire day late. They just don’t seem to care.,-1
2021-08-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,keep changing your flight and times,False,  Worst airline. Don’t fly with United. They keep changing your flight and times. Then their rude at the same time. Very inconsiderate for the people flying with them. It’s one thing to make a change but doing it five times for a two hour flight. No explanation as to why and then rude to the customers.,-1
2021-08-10,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Tampa,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2,charge $35 for a carry on,True,  Why did we have to wait more than a hour to get our bags. If you was allowing people to bring their carry on into the plane we wouldn’t have to be waiting for a carry on luggage at the carousels. United Airlines charge $35 for a carry on and we still have to put it under the bottom of the plane.,-1
2021-08-08,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Los Angeles,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,Horrible customer service,False,"  United has absolutely imploded on itself. We had nothing but problems to get to our honeymoon in Hawaii. We requested a refund for a missed flight due to the airline's fault, and we received hardly anything. The most aggravating thing is they won't even speak to you in person, you must email them. They messed up our bag refund, and no one will fix it. Horrible customer service and overall experience.",-1
2021-08-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to New York,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,suggest to avoid it altogether,False,"  Worst experience ever. You can purchase anything on board only if you have an app installed, but I don’t want their app on my phone. Fun fact: for some reason their WiFi won’t allow you to go to App Store so you won’t be able to download their app even if you want to and if you’ve paid for the internet. If you like to be forced to do something you don’t want use this airline. I suggest to avoid it altogether. There are way more better carriers on the market.",-1
2021-08-06,0.3,Solo Leisure,First Class,Denver to Sacramento,1.0,4.0,5.0,,,2.0,1, Where are your maintenance workers?,True,"  Take off was okay. Landing was too rough. I'm in the front seat 1st class. I slid off under my tight seatbelt and had to use both my feet and legs to stop me from slamming forward. The same thing with the person next to me. He had to use his feet to break himself from slamming forward as well. I paid 1st class for comfort on my back, but that landing aggravated my sciatica. Bad asset to your company. My seat, 1A cannot be reclined. It's broken or needs to be lubed. Where are your maintenance workers?",-1
2021-08-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Morelia via Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,unhelpful and unsympathetic,False,"  My mom is very sick and I am traveling to visit her, my tensions are extremely high. I called United the day before my flight to make sure I knew what to do to check my bag, they gave me wrong information. I also asked to confirm I had tsa precheck, they also gave me wrong information. This caused me to have to get on extremely long lines multiple times. I missed my flight by 5 minutes, even though I had been messaged that the flight was delayed 15 minutes. They say they close the doors 10 minutes pre take off, so they should have let me board. As soon as I booked to the next flight, it was delayed an hour. Mechanical. My connecting flight in Houston only had a 35 minute layover, so I was screwed. The flight was delayed two more times. I arrived in Houston around 9pm and went to reclaim my bag so it didn't get lost. After waiting for an hour and a half, I was told that against protocol, the bag went on to Mexico. I have zero confidence in the security of my bag waiting in the Mexico airport from 10pm tonight to 10pm tomorrow night. I have spent probably a total of 4 hours on the phone trying to resolve issues. The last time I flew in June, there was an hour plus mechanical delay. When I got to Houston, the flight was delayed from 3:40 until they cancelled it at 11:30pm. I had no choice but to sleep in the airport. The flight was rescheduled to go out the next morning. I am so upset I could spit. Customer service has been entirely unhelpful and unsympathetic. It is a sad state of affairs that people who work in a line of business that is integral for our population are such a miserable bunch not to mention the way this company conducts business is abysmal and appalling.",-1
2021-08-06,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Corpus Christi,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,One of the worst airlines,False,"  One of the worst airlines I have ever flown on. Every single flight and connecting flight was delayed. No accommodations made by the airline when their delay caused me to miss my connecting flight. Had to spend extra money to try and get to my final destination. Would highly recommend spending the extra money to fly a better airline (Southwest, Delta, Allegiant etc.)",-1
2021-08-05,0.9,Business,First Class,Washington to Chicago,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,United is a great choice,True,"  Last week i flew six flights with United. All were excellent and on time except one which arrived in IAH 30 minutes late. i went through DCA, ORD, DEN, PSC, SFO, IAH and TPA. I never met a rude FA or gate agent although there were many rude passengers. Service was as advertised and flights were as comfortable as you could expect. Still some small aircraft in service but it is manageable. Food and drink is sparse but there are many options at airports to buy and carry on. Planes are packed and everyone needs to take precautions against COVID. However, if you wish to fly, United is a great choice and you will receive far better treatment than the discount carriers.",1
2021-08-05,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Maui,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2,recommend looking at a different airline,False,"  We traveled from St. Louis to Maui with a layover in Denver. I’ll start by saying that all flights departed on time and the layover times were short but left no time for delays if needed. The staff was mostly rude and argumentative. With the mask mandate they were like wardens in a prison. God forbid you wanted to eat or drink on the flight you had to do it with your mask on. One flight attendant even shoved the policy in a passengers face when he asked about the policy because the attendants voice could not be heard over the loud speaker. The seats on the plane do not recline and was super uncomfortable for a 7 hour flight. The inflight movie was a nice bonus if you remembered to bring your own headphones. While traveling to Maui they require you fill out a form, however they will not provide you with a pen. We had to get out of our seats and ask other passengers for a pen, which violates their COVID protocol. I would recommend looking at a different airline.",-1
2021-08-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Little Rock via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the most unprofessional airline,True,"  United Airlines is one of the most unprofessional airline I’ve ever flown with. It was my first and my very last time flying with them. I’m in the military we were stranded in Denver due to the fact your employee broke my cooler and had the audacity to not released my stuff knowing very well I have a connected flight. What upsets me is how inconsiderate your airline was, I had a 1 month old baby with me who I had to delay going back to because your staff lack knowledge to release my broken package to get on my next flight. I also had to book new flight with United because me and my son missed our flight. Only for you to broke his car seat at our final destination.",-1
2021-08-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montrose to Denver,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Both segments were awful,True,"  Both segments were awful. The single agent for both segments was overwhelmed, overworked and understaffed which made them incompetent. Almost wasn’t able to get on the flight because on the front end, despite my being at the airport 1.5 hours early - she couldn’t get a bag tag to print and refused to manually send my luggage and literally left me at the ticket counter holding the bag with no agent. On the return, my boarding pass didn’t scan, despite her issuing it to me, and she couldn’t get it to work and wouldn't let me board the aircraft. I was coming from an international flight and was up for over 24 hours at that point and broke down in tears. She finally let me board the plane without a scanned boarding pass. I am not one to cry - but I cried on both ends of this flight.",-1

2021-08-03,0.4,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Brussels to Washington,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,2,Very attentive service,True," Flight UA950, IAD-BRU on July 30, 2021. Shout out to the Premium Plus crew who made what should have been an awful flight just that much tolerable thanks to their extraordinary service. For starters, United Airlines has a rather pathetic hard product. While the 787-10 itself is a great aircraft, the Prem Plus class in United is way below standards. Here are just the most annoying of the many issues I encountered: - Cannot make advance choice for vegetarian food - While seats are wide, the recline is not at all what one would expect for the price of Prem Plus. - No headphones provided in Prem Plus (unbelievable) and when I requested one, I was offered the one from Economy (decided to use my own phone headset instead) - They ran out of vegetarian option for dinner before they got to my seat (yes - that is the 3rd row from the front in Prem Plus!) - They literally dump all the food, snacks, drinks on a plate all at one time, crowding out the tray table. However, we had an outstanding crew that did their best with the limited resources United gave them in a totally packed flight. Very attentive service and I did not have to make a second request - the FA remembered what I asked once and tried to provide it through the rest of the flight. One of the best FAs I have had the pleasure of flying with. She saved the day for United. Turned what would have otherwise been a ""Never again United"" into ""Maybe worth another shot"" feedback.",-1

First we arrived @ airport @ 3am to catch a flight that doesn't even exist. They said it was not their fault cause I didn't buy directly with them. So we finally arrive at Houston, here, they started delaying our flight every 30 to 40 minutes, it is now 7 pm and I still have no answer. Laying on the floor with my 18 month old. This is not only happening to our flight, theres 27 flights with problems of delay or insufficient crew members.",-1
2021-08-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Mexico City to New York,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,won't fly with United ever again,True,"  I flew United Airlines UA2251 from New York to Mexico City on 27July 2021 I was told there would be no food service on board but would be able to purchase food and drink, that was not the case. I was told that unfortunately they were unable to load the food and drink on the aircraft in New York. I accepted that and completed the journey, on our way back from Mexico city with flight UA2252 we encountered the same problem. We were however offered soda, water, pretzels and biscuits on both flights for free. On top of that they offered in flight entertainment on the return flight only, with no headphones, again I would have had no problem in purchasing head phones from United Airlines. I felt that for an airline as big as United Airlines they could have made food available for purchase to the passengers. I for one would not have an issue with purchasing a sandwich and a beer at an extra charge. How difficult could that have been for United Airlines? What has happened to the upsell? I have been on airlines in Zimbabwe where they offer food for purchase on board flights and am shocked and disappointed that a third world country could offer a better flight experience than United Airlines. Come on guys get it together, I probably won't fly with United ever again because of this.",-1

First, my plane from SBA was delayed an hour before the pilot announced we need to fly to Phoenix to get fuel because they don’t have any. We fly to Phoenix and get fuel and finally make our way to our destination where I missed my connecting flight. They did give me meal vouchers and a hotel room however, it was 10 at night and everything in the airport was closed so I was unable to feed my children that night. Got to my hotel room and that’s a whole different experience. My flight didn’t leave until later but I had to check out of my hotel room at 12 so I stayed at the airport nearly all day with my two tired children until take off. My plane finally arrived (still United) and THAT plane was delayed. Sat on the plan for an hour and a half waiting for the problem to be fixed. Taking off 2 hours later. Absolutely ridiculous",-1
2021-08-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rochester to New Delhi,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Customer care is horrible,True," Customer care is horrible. Not at all pleasant to talk to. They will never provide any options. There are no choices left for the customer. Aviation being a hospitality industry, such kind of behaviour is at least expected. For the past three times this year, my flights have been cancelled and I have been left with no options. The reason is weather conditions. United Airlines aircraft are supposed to be the best ones, one can easily doubt the cancellation reason. A passenger who has been in the air for the past 24 hrs, the airline wants that person to be waiting in the smallest terminal with no food options no proper lounge area for another 6 hours.",-1

They sent me a text message at 3AM to advise of the cancellation for todays flight. MY flight was for 7:25 am as a direct route. They auto booked me for another indirect flight for tomorrow, and I would arrive tomorrow night. Unacceptable. I contacted the airline via the App, via phone (on hold with rep for almost 1 hour and then he disconnected me), and via text message with an agent. Each process has been unbearable. I have never seen an airline so inept in my life. I have provided each agent with 2 exact alternative flights that are available to book on united.com alternative to fly me on another flight for today (6:20pm to denver with connecting to LAX, 6:45pm to SFO and connect to lax). I even advised them that I can fly to LAX instead of SNA. I have wasted 7 hours so far trying to re-arrange my travel with them.

They are not organized and they don’t recognize their mistakes. They gave us 45 minutes to go through customs, get our luggage, go through tsa and put our gates at the other end of the airport. Nobody on our flight made it and the next flight was two days later for the ones who didn’t get a flight the next day. Some students were next to us crying because they couldn’t afford a hotel and the lady at the customer service told then to sleep at the airport until the next flight which was two days after for them. I was very disappointed with them and will never fly with them again. They told us we didn’t run fast enough and we were the first ones from our flight who arrived at the gate. Everyone we talked to at customs who was with United said they had 30 minutes and weren’t going to make it while other customers with other airlines were fine.",-1

From entering the airport to getting on the plane is a disaster. No one has any responsibility to the clients in any way. It seems as if they have designed the long lines and confusion to make your trip as uncomfortable as possible. No one knows why you must wait in one line after another checking and re-checking and triple checking your identity. Your address. Your destination. Your ticket boarding pass. Your height and weight. Your Covid test results. Getting to the airport now requires a minimum of 4 hours prior to your flight in addition to the extreme likelihood of a delayed flight or change of plan. In short-United Sucks. If you have a choice. Choose another airline.,-1

2021-07-27,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Myrtle Beach,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,never be using this company again,False,"  Saturday 7/24 we get a text telling us our fight is cancelled. So we rescheduled it. My wife had to reschedule 3 more times to later find out that we that there wouldn’t be any fights going out 7/25 and they scheduled the following day. Now we have to pay for another hotel which no hotel coupon discount was giving to us, we had to pay out of pocket $800 between hotel, rental vehicle and food for the day. Not to mention I couldn’t make to work so I lost money there also. So now we are getting ready to fly back home. They didn’t even give us a direct fight which we paid for no we had to do a connecting fight. Well at the moment we landed in Washington and they are saying we are delayed once again.  I will never be using this company again. I haven’t called them yet but they will get my peace of mind. Terrible just terrible",-1
2021-07-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Miami,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never be flying United ever again!,True,"  I cannot stress enough how absolutely awful this flight experience was. Not only was the air conditioning broken but the flight was delayed. Instead of deplaning, United decided it was best to keep all passengers aboard while temperatures reached upwards of 100 degrees within the cabin. We were stuck on the plane for an hour all doors closed and no air while still at the gate. Will never be flying United ever again! If you care about you health, safety, comfort do not fly United.",-1
2021-07-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Santo Domingo,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They were awake for 72 hours,False,"  United Airlines has the worst customer service, lack of empathy and is entirely unprofessional. The experience my 5 yr old daughter and husband had was absolutely unacceptable. Loading up a plane with 100 passengers and luggage after collecting fare from people making them wait four hours on the plane only to be told the pilot didn't show up and flight is canceled. Then the only option is to wait in line for three hours to rebook or cancel flight and it takes 5 days to receive refund. Finally rebook for a flight 24hrs later only to have that flight be late as well. They were awake for 72 hours. Just one layover and this happens, insane! Just telling everyone to never under any circumstances take United Airlines, you are better off taking Spirit Airlines. This place is a joke.",-1
2021-07-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Albuquerque to Fresno,,,,,,,1,ticket was not refundable,True,"  I had to return to NM after being stuck in CA by the pandemic. Because of my age and physical limitations I purchased a first class/fully refundable ticket. I was originally scheduled to return to CA 4/23/21 but was unable to keep that date and changed me ticket to July 20, 2021, as shown on the attachment. To be certain I was doing everything correctly online I called United to walk me through the process. When I reiterated that my ticket must be fully refundable, I was informed that first class is always fully refundable. I don’t trust people in general, so before I changed the ticket I called again to speak to another agent who confirmed the information I was given initially on fully refundable/first class tickets. The second agent concurred so I changed my ticket. On July 18 I cancelled my trip due to physical limitations. Had I taken the trip I would have been in bed, literally, for three or four days immediately afterwards. My children pointed out that the trip would be too much for me. Immediately after canceling the ticket online I called United. The website would not allow me to apply for the refund, so I called for assistance in doing so. The agent was very nice and walked me through the online process. However, I received an email from United informing me that my ticket was not refundable, even though it was first class. I explained the entire situation to be virtual told ‘oh well’. I am now out more than $1,000 and there seems to no recourse.  If I weren’t so old and not physically able, you can be certain I would picket United airlines at the airport.",-1
2021-07-24,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Chicago,1.0,,4.0,,,2.0,1,Very claustrophobic,True,"  Absolutely terrible. Very claustrophobic, I’m small but my knees were touching the seat in front of me. The people in back were also touching my seat with their knees. The toilet hadn’t been flushed and there was urine on the toilet seat. The only redeeming factor quality was the airline staff.",-1
2021-07-23,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Wichita to Durango via Denver,1.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,"Horrible, just terrible",True,"  Horrible, just terrible, they cancelled all flights on the 22nd but let UA 5357 go to Durango from Denver at 9:55 but canceled every other United flight that night after canceling at 8:00. Made everyone, up to 600 people line up to customer service with only 2 agents running it for 4 hours before more agents showed up, a virtual agent hung up on a elderly lady for wanting to go back home and be refunded. Then delayed my flight for 2 days straight, always the crew was “ missing” never flying United again",-1
2021-07-22,0.4,Family Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Newark,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,First class was awful,False,"  Have not felt safe traveling during Covid. Booked Polaris Class flights on United from EWR to SFO and back. It was over $8,000 for 2 tickets, but felt that Polaris non-stop, at a reasonable time of day was worth it. The flight to SFO was wonderful - blanket, pillows, attention from flight attendants and fantastic entertainment center, as well as privacy in a ""pod"". Return flight was cancelled due to ""operational issues"" (which I'm guessing means no crew), and we were rebooked on a late evening flight to phoenix on a small jet, and a red eye from phoenix to EWR. First class was awful -- no service, no pillows or blankets on red-eye, no entertainment systems. Pilot wore mask under nose in airport, and no mask in plane when using rest room. I asked united for money back, since red eyes are generally cheaper, as are these flights in general. I got $150 voucher, and they would not give me any more than that. It's a shame that Virgin Air sold to Alaska airlines -- there are no good non-stop options from EWR to SFO anymore. There needs to be regulation regarding transparency in fares, and accountability for refunds when you don't get what you pay for. When you pay for First Class, service is part of the equation -- not being stuck on random flights to get you from point a to point b, with no compensation for the service that is lacking.",-1
2021-07-21,0.4,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to New York JFK,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,2,Next time for me it will Jet Blue in Mint to and from LAX,False,"  I had been looking forward to trying out United's re-introduced service from LAX to JFK in Business Class. They call it Polaris and it is supposed to be on par with their International service but on a domestic route. I found the boarding gate at LAX congested and confused. Once onboard and settled in the seat was quite comfortable, although the plane was crammed and they had the old overhead bins. There was a large pillow for your head and a smaller harder one for your back, along with a blanket and amenity kit. We departed late which meant we would not arrive in JFK until well after midnight. The entire plane was full, with a full Business Class load of 48 passengers. The 2 cabin crew in Polaris were very nice but rushed and harried, and only came around once for drinks after take off. I had to get up and go to the galley to get my red for the dinner, which was served on a cart but all hot entrees piled on top of each other and then put down on your tray. After dinner they came around with sherbet on a tray. The seat did extend to a full length bed and was comfortable so I slept for a few hours. I did not like wearing the shoulder strap for take-off and landing. The other thing I noticed that when she came around to take the meal order the F/A asked if I wanted the chicken or the butternut squash pasta, and said that if they ran out of chicken would the squash be okay. In other words they had under catered the chicken. Still no glassware. In the cabin crew's defense they did say that there were only 5 flight attendants to work a full 767-300 so 2 worked in Polaris with the other 3 in the economy cabins. United need to put more crew on this plane if they to compete with AA, DL, and Jet Blue on this lucrative and important route. Next time for me it will Jet Blue in Mint to and from LAX.",-1
2021-07-21,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Newark,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,I received notification that my flight is being postponed,False,"  I was scheduled to depart tonight for a special birthday celebration. Hotel and flight were booked through Priceline, tours and reservations were made and childcare was arranged. This morning I received notification that my flight is being postponed until tomorrow. I called the airline and waited on hold for over 49 minutes. The agent I spoke with was helpful but was unable to get me on another flight. The cancellation notice indicated the flight was changed out of Newark due to possible weather issues or ongoing runway issues. This is the second flight out of Newark that a family member was scheduled on that was cancelled out of Newark, I’m disappointed that airlines have not adjusted schedules if the runway issues are ongoing. I suspect it may be due to labor issues, although airline will not say. The federal government provided monetary relief to airlines to insure that they would be able to run efficiently and maintain business. It’s disappointing to have this happen twice in two months out of Newark with no explanation. I understand things happen, but adjust schedule if the runway work has been disruptive or don’t offer so many flights if you don’t have the staff. Representatives were helpful but no other flight options available that would get us in today so losing hotel money and possibly tours that were arranged if I can’t get reimbursed.",-1
2021-07-21,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Fresno,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,would not recommend this company,False,  United Airlines delayed our flight for 5 hours in 30 in increments. Then got to Denver and board us and left us in a plane for 45 min with air. We left the plane to be told we were to go to another gate. When we arrived at the gate we were told no. We went back to the original gate and they said “ we made a mistake” I asked why didn’t you come tell us . It too is 20 mins and bother gate agent to find this out. He said “ well now you know. He was a manager at gate A85. I would not recommend this company to anyone.,-1
2021-07-21,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Richmond to Denver via Flagstaff,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,lack of customer care was terrible,True,"  There were typical delays that are occurring in the current climate. BUT my return home trip was the worst customer service I have received. The gentlemen at the counter was nice enough. I was getting delayed notifications on my phone and he let me know that I might want to reconsider my trip home because 'it looks like this flight will be canceled"". I said okay and asked him what my rebooking options were. After messing with his computer for a few minutes he got on the phone and was on hold for a very long time before sayin the me ""I am going to be on hold for sometime, give me your name and number and i will call you back in an hour or so with your new ticket information."" Flagstaff is the smallest airport I have ever been in. It feels like a very small town and I trusted that he would do as he said. After leaving the airport he was in fact correct. I received several more delay notifications, the flight was canceled and I was grateful I did not have to sit at the airport. The problem is he never called and never rebooked my flight. So I called the airline after about 2 hours and was on hold for a very long time only to be told that my only rebooking options were two days later! The agent did not seem to care about what happened at the airport or that I was incurring the hardship of two more hotel nights, meals and a rental car. She did not care that her fellow customer service person completely dropped the ball. They would not put me on another airline and were told me that was the next available flight. I could not explain why I was not automatically rebooked on the next flight and what happened! They honestly did not even care. This cost me so much more money in addition to the inconvenience of the cancelled flight. The lack of customer care was terrible.",-1
2021-07-19,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Houston,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,Fly American or Southwest!,True, Worst airline ever! Every time we leave Newark there’s always issues. Sat at the airport for 7.5 hours on Saturday only to have flight canceled with a 1 yr old. Then new flight on Monday kept getting pushed back in which we will miss connecting flight. They do not compensate nor do they care. Had to spend an additional $500 for the inconvenience. This is the third time in two years. Fly any other airline. United is garbage. So much more I can write but not worth my time. Fly American or Southwest!,-1
2021-07-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Boston,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,ground crew were so unhelpful,True,"  We were delayed for the first 24 hours .. we diverted to another random airport which made it impossible to know if you were automatically on the next upcoming flight to the correct airport. The ground crew were so unhelpful, only focused on their current moment, impossible to have someone just check your flights. Excuses ranged from the tarmac getting hit by lightning, a fuel spillage, a big flood, a fire - now this second flight is looking silly, delayed for three hours, no auto updates or communication. United customer service is so ridiculously unprofessional and stupid.",-1

They cancelled my flight, gave me no accommodations, and told me I needed to be here by 5.30 am or I would not be allowed to board. I showed up at 5.30 to be rudely told I would leave at noon and I could wait or not they didn’t care. It was the worst travel experience of my life and the airlines solution was to treat us as well as they do the luggage. There was no assistance or even an attempt made to act like they were assisting us. I will never fly here again.",-1

They sent me to the most run down motel in the worst part of town. Of course I had to pay for Uber both ways and meals. I missed work the following day. I emailed customer service to let them know about my experience and they made it much worse by basically telling me they don’t care. I will never fly this airline again. I had flown them twelve times over the last three months but never ever ever again.,-1

2021-07-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Athens to Newark,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,business class experience was a joke,True,"  We upgraded to United Polaris, and we had the worst experience on a Business Class ever. Boarding the plane was a complete mess. On board, the crew was rude and annoyed. Every question was answered with sarcasm and disdain. The whole business class experience was a joke. No menu, no beverage service before take off, food quality and presentation was worse than economy. Service was rushed and rude. Don't tell me that it's because of Covid - this excuse is no longer applicable. If this is the premium service offered by United, I feel sorry for the Economy passengers.",-1

Website would not provide rebooking options until original flight was listed as delayed which did not change until we were boarded on 2.5 hour delayed flight. Also tried calling United during delay to be informed of unusual call volume and expect over a 2 hour wait. Gate agent at first leg of trip said she would not help rebooking because we had not missed the 2nd leg of trip yet. After landing 2.5 hours late, the United app shows 0 flight options to Athens and to see Gate agent at original flight location to rebook! Never will book with United again!",-1

Got to Denver with 15 minutes to spare before my connecting flight left. Literally sprinted 30 gates to my gate. Myself and four other passengers were not allowed on the plane that was sitting out in front of us. Twenty minutes later I got a text saying my flight was delayed twenty minutes. Still wasn’t allowed on the plane. I was going to see my dying father. Didn’t make it. I wouldn’t fly United again if I was paid!! Couldn’t find a United rep anywhere to help me.,-1

So we had to exit the plane and wait until midnight to leave!! I’m so pissed an extra 5 hours at the airport and this was supposed to be my last connecting flight. When I tried to talk to someone to figure it out they ignored me. Didn’t have answers, and never called me back when I reached out multiple times. Such a joke of an airline. Terrible service.",-1

In all I’ve been delayed 5 hours and have lost over $1500 since they continue to have late flights, this is the third flight in a row I took with them and it’s been nothing but a headache.

2021-07-12,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Newark,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,I will never fly United again!,False,"  This is, by far, the worst airline out there. They charge you for everything and find any reason so you can’t check in online. Their lines are horrendous and make changes to your bookings without notifying you in advance which is what happened to me this past weekend. I had a 10am flight to NY, hoping to do some sightseeing but they bumped my flight to 1:30pm and by the time we got to NY, it was dinner time. Next on the way back, I couldn’t find my gf confirmation which was together with my when I bought the ticket. After calling Travelocity they told me that United decided on their own to separate and issued a separate confirmation to her without notifying me. The whole trip was a disaster and the same was for previous trip with United. I will never fly United again! This used to be a decent carrier, but no longer.",-1

The day before our travel we had received notifications for vouchers to move our flight, but we chose not to take it. We got to the gate 55 mins before the departure time and the staff said we missed our time to check-in baggage. They made us stay there for 10 mins and told us that we have to travel at a different time and nothing was available for the next two days. We were also told that they can't sent our bags on a different flight. Talking to our other friends on tour scheduled seats, they said there were United staff sitting on our seats. We ended up booking American airlines and leaving the same day.",-1

As soon as some arrive from other flights they will come to our gate” ha! Then the second lag of the trip, they delayed our flight. Again staffing issues. This time however they changed the gate and didn't tell us. I had to walk 10 gates to find someone and ask why our gate was empty when we had been waiting to board (15 min prior to boarding I finally found a human to talk to. Their communication center is a joke. She proceeds to tell me now they moved you to B60! We were at A71! We had to walk 2 miles and ride a train to get to the correct gate with about 45 seconds to spare. But no worries, we didn’t leave for another 2 hours!! This is why we fly American.

The staff are the rudest, most apathetic and unhelpful people imaginable. You can spend half your life on hold with their customer service it you still wouldn’t be put through to an actual human being. Literally will choose to swim across the ocean than fly united again.

TSA held me and my 12yr old son over 40min, and caused us to get to our gate, right around the corner at 6:30am, our flight was backing away from the gate. I had already checked in, now there's a 5+ hour delay. Came back, and the delay kept going, until the connecting flight in Chicago would have been missed. Now, I have to get a hotel because, no planes for us in Chicago the rest of the night. $200.00 for a room and the only one with a shuttle. Leave on time from Richmond, to Denver Airport, because the desk clerk promised me there wouldn't be a delay!! Guess what, another delay of .5 Hours. I just want to go home!

2021-07-09,0.8,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Washington,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5,United does a great job,True,"  United does a great job. I have been consistently impressed over the course of my last several flights with United, including today's flight with my minor son from Paris. Chief Purser Stephanie did a great job by being responsive and helpful. The crew worked hard and appeared to be a well coordinated team. The aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable. We were in their new 'Premium Plus' cabin between economy and business which had a decent seat in a 2-2-2 configuration with decent recline and a little extender at the legs, plus a nice large, mostly clean lavatory at the front of the 5-row cabin. The cabin has a cozy feel and nice color scheme. United has good entertainment with tons of movie titles. Flights have generally been on time, although today's left Paris 40 minutes late after some last minute musical chairs by United staff travelling as passengers which the captain kept referring to as ""re-balancing"" -- which I now see was code for ""we need to move people around a bit"".",1
2021-07-08,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,West Fargo to Denver,1.0,2.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,not impressed with the bagging,True," Recently flew and not impressed with the bagging. First flight could get checked in via text and put bag in the plane. Second flight when I was trying to check in it said I had to check in at terminal. When I got there the guy was a little flustered because of the people who had questions. I asked if I had to check my bag in. He said not to worry and checked me through. When I got to the gate, I have to check it in and pay $60. That's what really made me upset. I may not have understood directions all the way, so that's on me but that is outrageous to charge $60 bucks for a bag going on a one way trip. When we landed on the tarmac, we exited the plane outside and some people got their bags brought over and others didn't. I saw mine was laying on the floor near a wire basket so I went to get it but the guy told me I couldn't be in that area and had to pick it up at the carousel. I told him that was my bag 15 feet away but he wouldn't give it to me. So I had to waste my time and go wait for my bag to come through the carousal. Will not be flying United. I don't need to be pampered but I paid my ticket and felt these little things were a jab. The airline staff was nice and the plane landed safely as the good points.",-1
2021-07-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Miami,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Horrible customer service,False,"  Horrible customer service. The very moment something was changed from the original schedule everything went wrong. I had a 0645 flight. I changed it to a 1445 flight. The 1445 flight was canceled and they charged it back to the 0645 without telling me anything. I called to confirm a 1400 flight before all the seats were booked. The online agent was absolutely useless. I had to walk her through finding me a new flight. She still couldn't complete the task before I got to the airport. Front desk barely missed booking me for the 1400 flight so they put me on standby for it. But made me a roll over for the 1745 flight. So I make the 1400 flight. Land in Houston and my baggage was shipped on the 1745 flight. I go to baggage claim service desk for help. And the supervisor flat out refused to do anything to assist me but instead gave me a number to call. Straight up said ""It's nothing we can do. You'll just have to come back at 8pm to get your bags."" I call baggage claim support to explain to them everything that happened so I could avoid having to drive 2 hours just to get my bags. She being the only person that waste my time immediately approved me for my bag to be delivered. It's now on day 3 and I STILL don't have my bag even though they sent me a notice confirming I was supposed to get it yesterday at 7PM. I just got off the phone with their support team and all she could say was they left with you bag at 1300 today. Completely useless. Give me an ETA. Why am having such horried service consistently when ever I need someone from United Airline's help. Like they're working her but none of the have any clue about what's going on. Highly unacceptable. Horrible service. I highly advise avoiding them at all cost.",-1
2021-07-08,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Des Moines to Chicago via Atlanta,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,I was super impressed,False,"  This was my first time flying and I was super impressed, from start to finish the staff at the airport and flight crew were =friendly and nice!!! I told the lady in Des Moines at check-in that I was a newbie to flying and was unsure of what to do, she helped me out, saved me money on luggage and walked me all the way to my gate. She passed the word onto the flight attendant that I was a first time flyer and they bumped me up from economy to Business Class free  all the way to Chicago. The flight attendant checked in on me multiple times to ensure that I was happy and comfortable as well. Then in Chicago word got passed on again about me being a first timer, I was walked off the plane by the attendant and met by an airport employee who personally walked me all all way to my next gate and I was also asked to board the plane first despite being in group 5. They sat me in business class again free of charge and treated me like family the entire way. After we landed in Atlanta the Flight attendant was heading home and walked me to the baggage claim, she sat with me until my baggage came around and then walked with me to the exit so that I didn't get lost anywhere along the way. I see alot of negative reviews on here about the airline but I was 1000% impressed with the service I received and I will definitely be flying with the company from now on.",1
2021-07-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Savannah to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,packed plane with no air conditioner,True,  Small packed plane with no air conditioner. I asked if there was a problem with the air and was told it would get better once we were in the air. The temperature did get better but there was no air flow. We taxied for 45 minutes in a very hot cabin.,-1
2021-07-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Santa Fe,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,incompetence by United,False," Newark to Santa Fe. This review has to do with United Airlines credits. Due to the pandemic, I was given a United credit. When I tried to use it, United put up many obstacles to prevent me from using it. It took 3 calls and at least 4 hours of waiting until I got an offshore person who was highly uncooperative but I finally booked the flight which was more than the credit, and I paid the amount less the credit. That was an annoying experience and I thought it was over but it wasn't. About 8 hours later I get an email saying the flight was cancelled but it wasn't cancelled. They refused to issue me a credit for the original flight but issue me a credit for the the flight that they said was cancelled but it wasn't cancelled. This isn't incompetence by United but a blatant attempt to steal money. In my case it is $454.89!",-1
2021-07-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"No weather issues, but still a 3 hour delay",False,"  No weather issues, but still a 3 hour delay. Wouldn't allow prepaid luggage or early check in online. No actual carry on bags for economy class. The entire thing is a joke. I thought other airlines were bad but this is next level atrocity. Negative 5/5 stars.",-1
2021-07-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Minneapollis,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,This is not the first time and it won’t be the last this happens,True," There are many other airlines that are just as cheap and have a much better experience. Will never pick this airline again. Completely disappointing. Much prefer Delta and Southwest. I have booked a flight from Springfield IL to Minneapolis with United Airlines, my journey was horrible and never want to fly with them again. I travel with United every week and they really don’t care about the customer. On July 1st I had planned my travel from Springfield IL to my home in Minneapolis, worst thing was that after reaching Chicago they said the flight was delayed for an hour, I am supposed to get my flight at 7pm and it was delayed to 10pm, at 10 pm they said its delayed until 11.30pm, and all of sudden they announced the flight was delayed until the next morning 7.30am. I literally waited for 16 hours to get the flight. I travel every week with United and this is the worst experience I've had. This is not the first time and it won’t be the last this happens. I just hope to save someone the time and money by saying avoid United.",-1
2021-07-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,First Class,Houston to Savsnnah,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,griping to each other about passengers,False,"  I could have flown Coach with the same, if not more, amenities. The charger would not accommodate my IPhone, I couldn’t have my purse because I was in the front row, a mechanic was fixing a door in the aircraft (which was already delayed due to weather), and the flight attendants were griping to each other about passengers.",-1
2021-07-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Great Falls to Charlotte via Denver,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,it’s delayed because the plane broke,True,"  I had already missed my morning flight. So they gladly rebooked me at a later flight in the day. What a mistake thinking this might be better. From Great Falls to Denver, Colorado. Due to bad weather-and low fuel-we had to fly to Colorado Springs and refuel because they didn’t have enough in the tanks to stay aloft. When we landed in the tarmac, we were in if ten other grounded planes. That took a while for us waiting on the tarmac an hour-to take back off and go back to Denver. There are no chargers on board. So when we finally land in Denver. We stand in line for about 3-4 hours with both customer service lines at least 4 city blocks long. Everyone is hungry but I don’t have anyone to get me food. I also don’t have a phone charged up anymore due to no flight charging. And I forgot my cord. So a customer service rep comes out after 2 hours and hands us a card with a 1-809 number in it-telling us there’s no reason to wait in line-just call this number or re-book at a kiosk. So I get out if line to buy a phone charger cord-but every store that would sell these are literally closed. So I walk back to the monster line and wait at least another hour in line. With 4 wonderful but understaffed customer service reps. One helps me. You overhear they should have gone home by now-but will be there until midnight. At least one of the employees thinks to hand out overnight toiletry bottles. By the time I get there, I got rebooked to fly out at 9am the next morning. Flying alone, exhausted from the standing in line-I realize getting a taxi to a hotel or even being able to make a hotel reservation is impossible because my phone is dead. A nice lady who just missed her brothers wedding hooks me up for the remainder of the line wait. The only restaurant open at this time is McDonalds at Gate A, that you have to take a train to get to. My ankle is acting up by now. I wait in another line for a half hour, and wonder if I’m going to get sick from eating McD’s it’s the only restaurant open at this point in Denver. At this point I just want to fly back home with minimal time before my scheduled flight home. I had to speak to a boarding gate specialist to get help with the video concierge, which was cool. He confirms that my luggage has ample time and can be re-routed to MT. But before finishing the transaction that took 22 minutes-the audio patched in the audio from the kiosk across from me. We just end the call because communication no longer works. Luckily I got a text telling me my new seat has been confirmed-but the new e-ticket won’t come up on my phone yet. So The boarding gate specialist offers to And just barely was able to print my ticket out for me. I find out my new route home didn’t include any notes about not needing the flight. So if I hadn’t inquired-they wouldn’t have seen any notes about this and made a refund harder to get. I get to my gate for my new new flight home. And it’s delayed because the plane broke. They find a new plane-we walk to a new gate. We get to the new gate-and the gate people have no knowledge of the connecting flight. So we finally get in the plane. And I’m sitting next to a man who is so wide-his arm is touching mine and I have to sit hugging myself just to not have to feel his arm on mine the whole flight home. To top it off. I get home and my luggage ended up going to Charlotte.",-1
2021-07-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Anchorage to San Francisco,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,This has been a total nightmare,True,  My flight was scheduled on July 4 2021 Sunday at 1:00am. We checked in and were at the gate and then we’re notified that it was delayed by an hour then 2 hours and then completely rescheduled to evening 5 pm That is 16 hours delay. After we check in for 5 pm we were notified every hour that it is again delayed. In total we were notified 8 different times the aircraft had a technical issue and was repaired and then brought to the gate. To our horror wrong aircraft was brought and we were delayed again. This has been a total nightmare we have at the airport for over 24 hours now. The food vouchers provided are not really accepted at at all food vendors.,-1
2021-07-04,0.2,Family Leisure,First Class,San Diego to Denver,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,United made zero effort to fix the problem,True," Bought a ticket in first and the United check-in system confirmed check-in, but then canceled the leg in error. Spent an hour trying to get it resolved. The ticket agent and gate agents were no help. The ticket agent spent 30 minutes on hold with United trying to figure out what to do. The two supervisors were rude. The logical way to remedy the issue was to bump an upgrade to accommodate the paying passenger, but they were unwilling to do that. United made zero effort to fix the problem.",-1
2021-07-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Jacksonville via Chicago,1.0,,4.0,,1.0,2.0,1,departure time was pushed back four times,True,"  Worst experience by far! Leaving home (JAX, FL) we had a layover in Chicago that should have been about 40 minutes. It ended up being 8 hours. Our departure time was pushed back four times, before they let us board the plane. We sat there for a hour before they had us get back off the plane, because no one could fix the weather radar. So we waited an additional hour for another plane to fly in. Then, leaving Vegas to get home was a complete disaster! We got to the airport early enough to check in but was told we were too late and had to wait 5 hours for the next flight to Denver for our layover. We board that plane and had to wait a hour for a pilot because one of ours wasn't feeling well. However the replacement pilot flew in from another flight! For some reason, the plane wasn't fueled up before leaving, which caused us to have to land on a secondary port for fuel. The fill in pilot was then out of flight time, which caused us to be stranded for 8 hours in Grand Junction. The airline promised us hotel accommodations since everyone missed their connection flight. But when we made it to Denver, they apologized for not having rooms for us. Most people had to sleep here in the airport (where we are still sitting). We got here at 12am and it's now 7am. We were supposed to fly straight home from here, but now we have a layover again in Chicago and we just are praying it goes as planned!",-1
2021-07-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Everything was horrible,False,"  I was supposed to fly from Vegas to Denver and we were supposed to depart at 11:50 but our pilot got sick and we had to wait for a replacement pilot, which was a 30-40 minute wait. After he got there one of the crew members went to the bathroom in the airport and took up his flying time. We were about to get to Denver until the wind got bad and we were told to circle around but we apparently didn’t have enough fuel to circle around for an hour so we had to turn around and go to Grand Junction to fuel up which was an hour wait but right before we were about to depart back to Denver our replacement pilot had to time out because of the crew member that went to the bathroom. We would’ve made it if she would’ve used the bathroom beforehand or just used the aircraft bathroom. After all of that we had to wait at grand junction for about 6-7 hrs until we had to get to Denver. Once we got to Denver they were very rude about reimbursements. They said they would book hotels for us but they didn't have any rooms so we all had to figure it out. And they gave a slip with a confirmation so we can call and give them our receipts for everything we had to spend money on. Half of the people on my plane had to sleep at the airport because of this. Also right before we were about to depart from Grand Junction they had the back row move to the exit row because of unbalanced weight. Everything was horrible and this airline sucks.",-1
2021-07-04,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Syracuse,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,I had the worst experience,False,"  Today I had the worst experience I had with United Airlines ever. I had tried many airlines before. Indeed this is the most disappointed one. I got to the airport and was informed by the front desk that I was 2 minutes late to check in my bag, and the young lady told me she cannot help me check in my prepaid baggage. She demanded I rebook my flight although I still have 40 mins remain to go through the security, so my family decides to leave the bag here and shipped it later. One of my family members wanted to leave the bag at the side of the resting area quickly so she can walk with me to the security gate to make sure there is no further trouble. The front desk employee yelled we cannot put the bag nearby airport seating benches and urged my family to take this out of the airport, and cannot leave this inside. We followed what she said and took the bag out of the airport. This was a terrible experience with the United airline, and the employee needs better training to treat customers better.",-1
2021-07-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Syracuse via Newark,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,avoid United like the plague,True,"  I vow to never fly this airline no matter how desperate I am to get somewhere. The communication within the airline is non existent from what I observed. From the very beginning before even getting to the airport I started receiving texts telling me I would be delayed. I wasn’t too upset to begin with being I hadn’t left the house yet. But the text kept coming in, my original departure was 10:55 pm on June 30th. We actually departed around 2:10 am July 1st Pacific time. It was a fast flight across the country (5 hours) that was nice. I only got one half bottle of water the entire flight. That was odd. Got to Newark between 10:30-10:45 am Easter standard time. It was so disorganized getting off as usual. My connecting flight was supposed to depart at 1:45 pm but that of course did not happen. My gate was changed a total of 7 times which is where the coordination between staff was lacking. I was dragging around 2 toddlers ages 2 and 4 all over the airport to all the different gates. With the gate changes of course also came with delays, we finally departed at 5:00 pm and got in at 6:00 pm. While my overall I was only 3 hours and some minutes late, the ordeal had me up well over 24 hours. I can’t imagine if I would have needed to actually be somewhere on a more strict timeline. Now I know there were supposedly “weather conditions”. However I also told (by a United staff member) that it was because of lack of staff to be on the plane and we were waiting for a Stewardess that was hours away. They attitudes of staff was not bad but it wasn’t great either. This company sets up their workers to be verbally attacked by disgruntled customers. I had had enough and went to go to customer service but unfortunately for me there was no one staffing it, and the same thing happened to my husband the same day because he was meeting us from another state. This is not the first time and it won’t be the last this happens. I just hope to save someone the time and money by saying avoid United like the plague. If you want to be on time just spend a little more money and fly with another company.",-1
2021-07-04,0.2,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Johannesburg to Newark,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,experience on UA was abysmal,True,"  I flew UA for the first time in years due to convenience of route and UA matched my AA status for 90 days. First UA flight was codeshare with Brussels Airlines EWR-BRU continuing to Africa on SN and ultimately returning JNB-EWR. All flights business class. My experience on UA in one word - abysmal. Check in at EWR was chaotic. Only self-check in machines available but they had to be operated by United personnel. There was one UA employee for about 6 machines in the premium check-in area with people pushing, cutting in line and certainly not any form of social distance. The agent was clueless and check in took over 30 minutes. From two flights in Polaris, I have quipped that Polaris should be a violation of the Geneva Convention. The seat is smaller and more cramped than what I am accustomed to on other carriers. The configuration of the seat and the tray table is such that there is no room to move legs with the seat fully reclined. I have bruises on both shins from trying to adjust leg position under that overhang. Unlike other airlines, United is not offering special meals (even got a special meal on the Brussels Airlines leg to Entebbe, Uganda). Instead, there was at least a vegetarian option but UA is hiding behind COVID restrictions to provide a meal which was at best a sub-par coach meal for a discount carrier. Even worse on the 15+ hour JNB-EWR service with a coach-like tray dinner, meager breakfast and not a snack in between. Flight attendants on both UA legs were pleasant enough but certainly not in any way attentive. Just matter-of-fact doing-my-job. I certainly cannot say that UA has earned my loyalty based upon this experience and gladly am returning to my prior carrier and its alliance.",-1
2021-07-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orange County to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Horrible experience,False,  Horrible experience that I had on 7/3. The airline should have known about the bad weather in Houston. The excuse of deplaning in Dallas due to fuel shortage is unacceptable. This could have been avoided for 100+ people affected from the flight by fueling the plane fully at the Orange county Airport. This will be my last time flying with this airline due to its unpreparedness. United needs to be more preventive with risks and not reactive.,-1
2021-07-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Savannah,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,Communication is seriously lacking,False,"  Horrible. I have not flown once with this airline in the past 3 years without experiencing some sort of issue, delay, or cancellation. Communication is seriously lacking. Last time I flew, I almost missed my flight because they changed up the gate last minute and never notified me of the change. I have had to demand refunds or compensation more than once from this company. Every time I’m waiting to take off, something has me waiting on the plane ready to go for an extra hour before we even approach the runway. Their economy class planes are so uncomfortable I am hurting every time I get off the plane. The only positive thing I have to mention is about their flight attendants, who seem very professional and nice. I will be looking for a different airline to stay loyal to from here on out. I know I’m not the only one. I would give 0 stars if possible.",-1
2021-07-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Palm Springs via San Francisco,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly on this airline again,True,"  The customer service is terrible, no one knows what they are doing . I arrived on the 1st of July 2021 in San Francisco heading to Palm Springs and I never received my baggage which I was suppose to clear in San Francisco customs. When I found out that my baggage didn’t arrive I tried to file a report no one was available anywhere from United to help after spending half an hour looking I finally found a representative that told me I had to file my report at the baggage claim in Palm Springs when I arrived at Palm Springs I waited 1 hour looking for a representative and found out that the employee that unload the baggage off the plane is the same one that handles the claims which in my opinion is a poor customer service. After filing the claim he said that they will trace my baggage and they will deliver my bags she to my residence the next day and gave me a claim number. The next day I called to check when my baggage didn’t arrive the representative told me they traced my bags and that they should arrive the same day so I told her I will go to the airport to pick it up. But they didn’t show up again when I called agin another representative told me that the bags are still in Frankfurt. Nobody seem to know where is my baggage.  No one know anything in this company. I will never fly on this airline again.",-1
2021-07-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Tokyo via Houston,,,,,,,1,terrible customer service,False,"  Absolutely crazy and terrible customer service. We booked a flight from FLL to IAH to NRT both ways in April 2021. In July we found out we were moving to Denver for a job opportunity. Hoping to cancel the FLL to IAH leg and just catch the flight in Houston, I reached out to United to find out the cost of this ... 1900$ per person to fly less. They could've easily resold our FLL to IAH seats and I would have happily paid a change fee, but to rebook us for another 2k per person is a scam and robbery.",-1
2021-07-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to San Antonio,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,extremely rude and unaccommodating,False,  Went to visit my brother in San Antonio on the air force base for the first time since he joined over a year ago. Our first flight to Houston was about five minutes late. We got to the next gate and should have just made it. There were a few other people from our flight waiting and confused as well. They had shut the gate early and weren’t letting us board. I spoke with customer service and they were extremely rude and unaccommodating.,-1

2021-07-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston via Jackson,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worse than Spirit Airlines,True," Worse than Spirit Airlines. My first flight got delayed 4 hours to the point where I’d miss my connection. So I rescheduled to the next day. I got on my first flight and it was fine, now I am on my second flight and we boarded over an hour ago and are still sitting here not moving. We have yet to depart and it has been an hour just sitting here. We boarded at 3.22, this plane was supposed to arrive at its next stop at 4.15 and it is now 3.41! The bathroom on this plane is also locked due to the incompetence of a flight attending so we are sitting here with no bathroom and no explanation as to why the plane has yet to move. I will never give this airline another dime of my money.",-1
2021-07-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Tampa,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never fly United again,True,"  I'm waiting at the gate to board my flight from Houston to Tampa. The usual announcement ""we've overbooked the flight, if anyone wants to give up their seat week give a few hundred dollars and a first class ticket for the next flight. No one was giving up their seat. I never give up my seat however I decided I'd go and talk to the gate agent. I told them I'd give up my seat for the first class ticket abs I want a thousand dollars as I'm a sailor and crew boats and really don't fly often. So the head manager comes down prints out my first class ticket (awesome) and then writes me out a check for $1260.00-wow! So I deposit it thru my mobile banking app. At this point the plane has left along my bag. So I'm waiting for my flight. Time to go get my next flight. So I go when they call Group 1 (1st class boarding) and to my surprise the ticket isn't valid. The boarding agent gets an attitude and tells me ""I need to rebook my flight, go to the customer service desk"". I tell him nicely no he needs to get customer service. So he prints out another boarding pass and I take it without looking at, just glad to be getting in the plane. And another surprise is not 1st class. OK no problem. However now that ticket not being valid I started to doubt that the check was bogus. So I decided to cask customer service to verify the check. This dude right away tells me he is calling the authorities to take me off the plane cause I'm not supposed to be on the plane .. so how do I have this boarding pass and how am I on the plane then? Treating me a veteran with no criminal record and federal ID like a piece of garbage. So I get off the plane and go back to the gate before the authorities arrive. Luckily a new manager showed up and got a new boarding pass. I will never fly United again. I week never give up my seat again. Never fly United!!",-1
2021-07-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kalispell to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,never using United ever again,True,"  Tuesday, on way to Kalispell from LAX, even with the 24 hour text check in, they made it extra difficult and after all that, they tried to re-book me for the following day! Wait at the airport/parking lot for 20+ hours? And leave my party hanging in MT? Luckily AA had an upcoming flight within the hour (at an exorbitant rate, but what can you expect for last minute accommodations?) so I rushed over to get that. Two days later, for my already prebooked flight (roundtrip booked three months in advance), everything again went well with the online/text check-in. Though, as with previous experiences, I checked in at the airport four hours in advance, just to be safe. Lo and behold, since I wasn't headed to Minnesota, I asked the crew what the problem could possibly be. They checked via computer and called up LAX office, and verified that I am on the way to LAX. My seat has been reserved for me (why wouldn't it be, after booking this three months ago?!) but I would need to fork over a nearly 90$ surcharge. Since my trip was just a one-way now (since I had to AA over here from LAX). Alright one-way is twice as expensive as round-trip. Makes a lot of sense. Can safely assure never using United ever again!",-1

My flight was delayed to Denver couple hrs they loaded us up twice then we get to Denver and find out my flights was canceled to Houston so I get off the plane and they supposed to be there with a chair for me and they have one that was for someone else who didn’t want it she had her own and then I began to ask him for one he said I had to walk to the desk to get help when he could have call for me or something about almost to the desk the guy comes with my wheelchair then he said that sat down on cart and he’ll know everything that I will be taken care of lol they drop me off at the area where my cancel flight was and left then I had to find a customer service desk which I had to walk to. I have cerebral palsy I did try to get help with couple of people who was working there no one was answered me or help until I was standing in a long line waiting to talk to someone some men who was help people in line got to me started help in hour about on flight to Houston. I was so thankful but then I get to Houston no wheelchair again. I had to walk again to the desk from the plane and I called United airlines before my trip I told them I had cerebral palsy and I will need a wheelchair at the airports and even in Houston bc I will be riding a shuttle to my hotel in Houston, but no wheelchair waiting for me at any point. This was the worst flight I ever been on ever! And I have flown many times and never had this much trouble or this less help it’s bad when others people on the flight is telling the people who should of been helping that I need help and one lady even came back to help with my bag that I trying to carry and walk!! I did not get to Houston Until 2am about I was supposed to be at 10 pm",-1
2021-07-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dominican Republic to Michigan,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1,their poor customer service,False,"  Horrible experience flying with United Airlines. Our trip from the Dominican Republic to Lansing became quite a fiasco. We left the D.R. And flew to Washington D.C. which was fine but our flight from D.C. to Chicago ran over an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were then given a new flight to Grand Rapids and told that our luggage would be on that flight to G.R. which was not true. As we got into G.R. also over an hour late, we found out our luggage was still in Chicago. Luckily we had to go back towards Illinois soon so we requested they hold our luggage in Chicago. When we got there to pick up our luggage we were told there’s no reason why we should think they would hold it for us and the worker at the desk was extremely rude. According to her, it wasn’t their fault that our luggage was lost even though we were told it would be back in Michigan we were the ones at fault. After about an hour of waiting, we were given our luggage that had been in Chicago all along. Very disappointed with the way things were handled in this situation. I understand that situation was probably very uncommon but it still needed to be handled in a professional manor. I can honestly say we will never fly with United again due to their poor customer service and lack of communication for something that was ultimately their fault. My wife and I will never forget our trip home from our honeymoon and it’s all thanks to United Airlines.",-1
2021-07-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Houston,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,Horrible experience,False,  Horrible. I had to cancel the flight last minute because I put in the wrong date for travel and then was told that I would get a refund 5-10 business days. It’s been a whole month now. I tried calling and all I got was a notification of my cancellation but according to the lady who I spoke with it was 'the confirmation receipt' I had asked her for so I could talk to my bank which seems pretty fishy to me. My bank has never given me problems and they never refunded my money. Horrible experience.,-1
2021-06-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Denver to Missoula,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,I was unable to change my flight online,True, I wanted to change my flight to the exact same flight leaving a day early and the computer directing me to buy into the United Economy for $90 to be able to change my flight. Once I completed this I was unable to change my flight online so I had to call customer service and was then put on hold for over 2 hours. I was then told it was going to cost $500 to change my flight. I asked to speak with the manager and they put me on hold again and redirected me to call the 1-800 number again.,-1
2021-06-29,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Norfolk,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2,So disappointed!,False,  I was not happy with my experience. I have added United to the list of airlines I will not fly again….which includes airlines like Spirit. I was upset that I couldn’t take a carry-on bag like literally a standard carry-on was banned for me. I would not have bought this ticket had I known that prior. Then you have to download an app to be able to have entertainment prior to the flight but they didn’t have a outlet to charge your device. What sense does that make? So disappointed! I felt like I was on a Spirit flight. Then I had a 8 hour overlay.,-1
2021-06-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Myers to Newark,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,rip you off with baggage fee,False,"  United is a scam company. They show lower prices on their tickets and then try to rip you off with baggage fees. I was allowed by the agent who printed the boarding passes to proceed, while the agent at the door made me pay 240$ for four bags that qualified for a personal item according to their guidelines.  I tried to contact them but the agent didn’t even bother checking on the facts that I sent them. I travelled with JetBlue with the same bags and there was no problem.",-1
2021-06-28,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4,put me on hold for 70 minutes,True,  We booked return ticket from Newark to Orlando. I tried to call customer care and they put me on hold for 70 minutes and later they connected me to a lady who barely talk English and made me made. She kept me hold multiple times to cancel the ticket and give me the new confirmation number. I don't know why these airlines people hire these kind of people to talk and make the customers mad. We don't want to get into this airline again in future.,-1
2021-06-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,will never fly with them again,True,"  I am a long time United Airlines flyer. I take domestics trips several times a year and at least two international trips a year. More often than not, my flight experiences have not been pleasant good ones. During one trip, it wasn’t communicated to me that a flight was delayed. I was rebooked twice during a connection due to flight cancellations. Eventually I fought for a hotel room because customer service was closing and they were going to leave me stranded. I got a room but had no luggage or toiletries.  This most recent trip I was alerted to a 5 hour delay from Knoxville. The only viable option I had was to drive to ATL. I missed the flight because of traffic. I was refused standby list for the next flight out and had a 7 hr wait. Thankfully I wasn’t charged a rebooking fee. Forget the barely decent planes and staff, I have many stories like this with United Airlines. I will never fly with them again unless I absolutely have to.",-1
2021-06-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,The staff are horrible!,True,"  The staff are horrible! Not understanding or compassionate what so ever! We were returning home from a family vacation and our outbound flight was delayed 2 hrs because the Denver airport was not allowing any incoming flights due to weather. When we finally landed we ended missing our flight from Denver to Tampa. Our flight was rescheduled for the next day I attempted to talk to three different customer service employees who did absolutely nothing to help me. The first employee told me there was nothing she could do my flight was already set and I had no choice but to accept. After explaining that I was traveling with three kids and if they provided any accommodations she stated no. When they are the reason you missed your flight, how can they expect you to dish out more money for a rental car and hotel room? The 3rd employee basically told me that I was lying regarding what the 1st told me.  The 3rd is the icing on the cake. I asked if there were any earlier flights than the one I had already received and told her which airports we could travel to, she changed my flight without even asking me if the flight she found was ok. After telling her I did not ask her to change my flight she looked to her co worker and proceeded to say I had asked her. She finally changed my flight back even after she said my seats were taken and told me to stick with it. How is this good customer service? I read over their “Customer Commitment” and nothing stated in that commitment is true. These people are mean, rude and not helpful what so ever.",-1

Will never fly again with them.",-1
2021-06-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Pensacola,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,2,The service has been awful,False,  United recently started direct flights to Pensacola and I fly down a lot from Dulles where I live. I usually fly Delta but have tried United now to avoid the layovers in Atlanta and crowds due to covid. I realize delays cannot be avoided but I can compare the stark differences between delta and United. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 5:35. It came and went we had some vague update to wait then another hour went by and no real update. Frustrations started peaking as by the 3rd hour they passed out water and snacks. Still very vague details and then now saying they were swapping a plane. The service has been awful. Dealing with delays can be handled so much differently. At delta we are updated every half hour. Told exactly what is happening whether it’s weather related or mechanical or whatever the issue is. At least we aren’t led on clueless til the hour arrives and then told to wait another hour. This wasn’t the first one either. My husband was flying back from Pensacola in March and had to wait 6 hours to get back with the same type of poor service with little to no update. Very frustrating.,-1

He worked in my part of the cabin throughout the flight and continued to have his mask below his nose. I informed the CSD on my way out that her flying partner was not following the airlines own mask rule.",1
2021-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pasco to Miami,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly through this airline again,True,"  We reviewed the dimensions and the sizes on the United website. I had a back pack as a personal item and the small dimension carry on luggage, I was told when grabbing my ticket i would have to check in the carry on luggage. The customer next to me was getting on the same airline and was told her carry on luggage was fine to pass when it was more bulkier then mine. If the website isn’t correct why have the dimensions on the website if you guys are still going to pick and choose who pays to check in there bag. I will never fly through this airline again!",-1
2021-06-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Muskegon,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,treat your customers with respect,False,"  We flew back from the Bahamas and our flight from Houston to Chicago didn’t have air conditioning so it was hot and stuffy the whole flight. Then I get to Chicago and have a 13 hour layover. Its cold as heck here with no where to get rest. Then when my flight finally gets there, their is mechanical issues so now I'm stuck here waiting for 2 more hours so far and I still haven't left the airport. I missed work and it doesn't even seem like they are doing anything about it. Our flight to the Bahamas was the same way, we had a 12 hour layover in Newark, NJ. Plan your flights better and treat your customers with respect. All of your staff was continually rude to me and my wife.",-1
2021-06-23,0.1,Business,First Class,Medford to Denver via Casper,3.0,,3.0,,3.0,1.0,1,reasons not to fly United Airlines,False,"  Three of thee four planes I needed to travel to complete my trip broke down. On the trip out I arrived late and was not able to use my first-class seat. I missed my connecting flights on my return trip and had to spend the night in the airport. I was not offered a hotel or food. I missed a day of work due to returning home late. We boarded the plane twice in Casper. I was lied to regarding the delay from Casper to Denver. The captain was the honest one and told the truth of mechanical failure of the air conditioner. The plane in Denver broke down as well and I had to be booked on another flight. The absolute worst service ever imaginable. I booked first cabin tickets and those were downgraded to economy. Trying to get a refund, after a week I have had no luck. The Customer service wait time on the phone is over 90 minutes. Seriously what else could possibly go wrong. I will be posting a very detailed account of my trip online as “Ten reasons not to fly United Airlines” as a serious comedy. Casper staff was incompetent and not helpful, but I do appreciate them being at work do to covid-19.",-1

First off, the fact that they were extremely rude to everybody who missed their flight because of mechanical issues was unprofessional. Second, when we asked for further accommodations they refused to do so. Our next flight is 20 hours later and that is the only one to Sioux City. When we asked the manager about further accommodations, she was incredibly rude to us. She kept saying “the hotel wasn’t free for us, so that is our accommodations.”. What are we supposed to do with our bags for 8 hours after we check out of our hotel? Lastly, I will never fly with United again. There are many other airlines that are just as cheap and have a much better experience.",-1
2021-06-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Cancún via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,To this date still no response,True,  Horrible Airline. They kept moving our flight. Originally had a 2 hour layover in Houston. They pushed our flight for unknown reasons except an email that said “your flight schedule has changed.” Instead of leaving at 5am we were to leave at 7am. We would arrive in Houston at 9.30 but our connecting flight left at 9.15 and they would not hold it. We had to drive from San Antonio to Houston to catch the connecting flight. The only solution they offered was to allow us to get on a 7pm flight after a 10hour layover in Houston. We drove to Houston the moment we found out we would not make the connecting flight in the morning. We contacted United and it’s been a couple months. To this date still no response. We will try our best not to ever fly with them again.,-1
2021-06-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,was the worst experience,True,"  We had a direct flight from Newark EWR to San Francisco. However within the first hour of flight the cabin pressure was so low that we had an emergency landing. We landed at Pittsburgh airport then they made us wait from 6Pm to 11Pm lying to us about another (rescue) flight being on the way! At 11 they gave us $30 food vouchers and then made us wait overnight at a sketchy motel we had to take shuttles there. Then next morning they said the flight would depart at 11 so we were at the airport at 8 Am just to be safe. Obviously they lied we departed at 2 Pm. So much time Wasted! I had also rented a car for 7 days for around $900 Total. I had to check in by 12:00 Am or I would be changed $2400. So I ended up paying $2400! The worst part is they didn’t give us our luggage! My kit was in the luggage as well.  It was the worst experience.  Original flight was delayed and we were supposed to land to San Francisco originally at 6:00 Pm (June 27, 2021) but landed at 2:30 PM San Francisco time( June 28, 2021). Had to cancel so many plans! Had to over pay for my car rental!",-1

2021-06-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Springfield,4.0,,5.0,,,4.0,1,I won't fly United again,False,  United unable to fly on time causing connection problems. Too much stress. Our flight out of GEG was on time to Denver. The flight to Springfield from Denver was over an hour late. Then evidently that hour timed out the flight crew. They had to page a replacement flight crew causing more delay. Ground transportation in Springfield is now screwed up. Text updates timely and helpful. Having to have a miles account to enjoy food and beverage is a huge hassle. Tell your IT cost saving morons to consider customer needs. I won't fly United again. The stress isn't worth it.,-1

My flight to Durango was delayed by 3 hours. Told it was misbalanced. Changed gates 5 times. Arrived so late a whole day was ruined. Then on return flight. Woke up early for a 5.45 flight. I was with my family. We paid for upgraded seats and baggage. Plane failed pre-flight, waited for a part to be flown in from Denver. Watched 2 other United flights, 1 Frontier, and 3 American flights depart. Missed my connection, was rebooked on another United flight middle seats throughout the plane. Called customer service asked for refund told I had to do it at the gate. Read reviews which said that United doesn't give refunds. Gate agent said she can't give refund. Sounds like breach of contract. Failure to provide paid services. Don't fly United!",-1

2021-06-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Fresno to Denver,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,You have lost 4 customers for life,True,"  We were rerouted to from Denver to Colorado Springs (due to weather) and we’re made to remain inside the airplane on the tarmac for 4+ hours without returning to a gate. The bathrooms were shut down the last hour of our flight because it was so full of waste. We were told we could leave the plane but could not take our luggage, could not reboard, and could not book another flight. We were basically held hostage by United Airlines. After I filed a complaint with customer care, I got an automated response that said sorry for the delay and we hope to see you on a flight again soon. No, thank you!! You have lost 4 customers for life! This is no way to run a business. Our experience was as disappointing as their “customer care” response.",-1

Booked my flight on third party site. Was not informed you could not have a carry on bag. Thought it was weird i could not check in online. Got to the airport where the United attendant said I had to pay $35 to check my small overhead bag. I was very upset as I have never been on an airline that you could not bring one small carry on. She said i could bring a personal item which i did not have. Then told me to go buy a small bag from gift shop to carry my computer, cell phone, wallet, etc. The audacity. Then she said I could have upgraded 24hr before for $45 and then I could have brought my bag. I have never flown United and will never again. Apparently this is all over there website.",-1

The other wheel was bent so bad that it was hard to pull. After standing in the baggage customer service line for over an hour, both the agent and I agreed this bag had to be forcibly thrown. She offered a different bag but it was much a lesser value and i was traveling with a set. After submitting my claim, I received an email advising my claim was rejected and the damage was wear and tear.  This unfair treatment. I will never fly United again.",-1

I was told that because there was no one staffing the International Desk that they were unable to verify my travel documents and therefore they would have to deny me boarding. They suggesting rebooking my fight to the following day when their International Desk would be staffed. How they can have no one working on the International Desk during check in of an international flight with complex flight restrictions is beyond me. What an awful experience and poor customer service. I flew the next day on El Al without difficulty.,-1

When I arrived at the airport, the staff at the check-in did not look like they wanted to help me out. I wasn't even given permission to choose my seat. Luckily, the gate agent for the flight was much nicer and was able to move my seat for me. Onboard, we were informed that the entertainment system was out of order, and therefore, the flight attendants advised us to install the united app for personal entertainment. After we departed on time, the cabin crew served us a snack bag which included a stroopwafel, pretzels, and Dasani. While this offering was much better than that of American, it is definitely lacking when compared to the full service offered on Delta and JetBlue. The rest of the flight was uneventful, and we landed on time at Newark.",-1

Her body language, words, and tone of voice said it all. The passengers were 30x more civil than her on this flight. She had her name tag covered with her hand when we were departing plane, I’ll bet she does that a lot. I’m a Premier Silver member on United, and have been recommending them for years, yet don’t intend to continue that. They were also 45 minutes late. Will be switching to another primary carrier.",-1

Staff are not knowledgeable on how to deal with customers. They are not co-ordinated, we check in 1 bag at the gate and we have another carry on bag, I asked the staff and she said the small bag was ok so we only checked the big bag at a cost of 35 dollars. We go inside the gate, at the gate they did not allow my other bag so I needed to check it in and I had to pay 60 dollars. I asked them how come they said at the check in that my other bag was ok and the crew could not give an exact explanation. Worst flight ever, I will not go to Hawaii anymore via United Airlines.",-1

When I bought my ticket I paid for a checked bag but then they changed my flight 3 times and I no longer had a checked bag and had to pay AGAIN. When they changed my flight they gave me the option to select different times than what they had changed it too but NONE were the original time that I had selected causing me to have to change my schedule. 3 out of my 4 flights were late causing me even more of an inconvenience. The process to get a refund for my baggage has been a nightmare. I WILL NOT choose to fly with them again willingly.,-1

I got to the airport and they kept giving me the run around. They eventually told me I can't get on the flight, and that the only thing they can do is put me on the 9.40 flight.

Spirit, Southwest, Frontier, Delta, etc... Most are not a pleasant experience. United is the exception. The flight attendants and staff were so professional. The aircraft clean. The passengers behaved well. It was a round trip flight from JAX - LAX with a toddler! I was prepared for delays, problems, crappy service. I was surprised with the opposite. I just wanted to say great job United.",1

We boarded late, had to go back to gate and deplane, got back on the plane, and then had to deplane again. Every staff member was blaming another part of the crew. The poor flight attendant was the one that got stuck delivering the bad news to us each time and had to endure most of the frustration from the passengers. If you are still reading this, if you can help it at all on your future flight plans, do not fly with United.",-1

On return from Omaha after sitting in airport for 4 hours they told us that the flight would be delayed because of mechanical problems. Unfortunately the plane never left and people were waiting in line to talk to a staff member for 3-4 hours and it appeared they were not resolving anything. My wife and I went to the ticket counter and had a similar experience where they finally offered us a hotel room with no way to get there until we pushed the issue. Finally they got a shuttle and dumped us off at this substandard hotel with no transportation. We are business owners and Memorial Day is a super busy day for us however United could care less and did nothing to get us home. When I got home I called their customer service line and after listening to me she said you can hold for a supervisor but it will be 45 minutes to an hour (are you kidding me) then she said you can go online and file a complaint which I did and so far no response! Our flight back the next day from Omaha to Chicago was met with a screaming child and I mean screaming for the 1 1/2 hour trip non-stop! It was the worst experience in my life and I will never fly United Airlines again under any circumstances!,-1
2021-06-10,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Orlando,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3,United makes it so difficult to use a credit,False,"  Had a credit from a cancelled flight due to COVID. Went through a third party who booked the flights separately for some reason. This created two separate credits with United. When I was ready to use my credits, I was told I can only use one credit per flight, even though I booked the original flight together. So I had to break my new flight into two separate bookings to use both my credits. And that was my suggestion, not the United rep. I find it shameful that United makes it so difficult to use a credit that I already paid for. Be careful when booking flights, even though they say you'll get credit. They definitely make it difficult to use those credits, unless you spend additional money with them.",1

Still I will never fly United ever again after this experience. Flight canceled to Denver and for no apparent reason. Large inconvenience for me and the rest of the flyers.

2021-06-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,Indianopolis to Hilton Head,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,2,advantage of flying direct is lost,True,"  United says this is a 1 hour 22 minute flight. But that doesn’t include the two hours we were delayed leaving Indianapolis because catering hadn’t delivered water and other beverages, or the 45 minutes we spent on the tarmac in Hilton Head waiting for them to tow a disabled plane from the gate. The worse part is airport staff told us that catering had done the same exact thing the day before, With these kind of delays the advantage of flying direct is lost — it takes the same amount of time to fly thru Atlanta or Charlotte on a well-managed airline. Cheaper, too.",-1
2021-06-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Kahului via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly United Airlines again,True,  Scheduled flight in January for late May 2021. United cancelled our flight and routed us to Washington DC from Kansas City in order to fly to Hawaii. This would have added another 6 hours to our flying time. Things only got worse from there on. Customer service was terrible. The agents could not be concerned with our schedule due to their poor decision making abilities. Will never fly United Airlines again.,-1
2021-06-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lubbock to Cancun via Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst airline ever,True,"  Day 1, delay after delay after delay. Day 2, show up to the airport just for it to be delayed last second. This time due to the pilots working late and needing rest. So if they knew they worked late why didn't they get new pilots before then or delay sooner before everyone is at the gate ready to bored. No compensation of any form. Worst airline ever.",-1
2021-06-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Chicago,,,,,,1.0,1,misconduct and loophole manipulation,False,"  Horrific misconduct and loophole manipulation United Airlines inflicted on me early morning today. First of all, I booked a flight hours in advance for an emergency to return home before I had initially planned to. When I made the flight I had told the person I had my service dog with me, as well as my cat. She had explained that it’s 125 dollars for the cat to travel in his carrier with me under my seat. She even said that the service dog will most likely get his own chair for free since the flight was almost empty and it was only a few hours before travel. I double checked that if I pay the additional 125 dollars the cat would be allowed to board with me and that the service dog can come for free I called a shirt while later and double checked again. The horrific manner in which the staff had spoken to me was ridiculous. They then claim that I am wrong and that in addition to paying the 125, I had to buy a seat to put the cat under. I had told them I paid the 125 so I can have the cat under my seat, the service dog can get a chair. They had told me that since the service dog is taking the seat under my chair, then I had to pay for a new ticket just to put my cat under the seat, and they said if I don’t do this they will not allow me and the animals on the flight. My cat is in a 1lb backpack and weighs 6 lbs. They had expected me to not only pay his 125 per fee, but buy an additional 180 dollar seat, which they won’t even let my service dog use. They had refused to refund my order so I couldn’t go to any other company without that money, and when I lightly raised my voice to proclaim the injustice the manager yelled at me bad said that if I don’t calm down he will “refuse my boarding” so I had to text my friends and family at 4 AM to see if they can buy an empty seat to stay empty. Harrowing. Not only that, they declined my flight when I did have the money and booked me at another airport at a much higher flight still demanding both tickets.",-1
2021-05-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Newark,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,Terrible customer service!,True," I haven’t flown United in years and now I remember why. I have been flying with the same carry-on roller bag for many years and have always been able to carry it onboard. The lady at the United gate was clearly on a power trip and immediately told me I couldn’t carry my bag on and it would have to be checked. After explaining I always travel with it, she still made me check the bag. Once I was onboard, I saw other bags the exact same size. Terrible customer service!",-1
2021-05-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Washington via Rochester,,,,,,1.0,1,"We were out over $1,000! ",True,"  I was with my sister-in-law and soon-to-be sister-in-law trying to fly home (1st of 2 flights) after my soon-to-besister-in-law's bachelorette trip. Our flight time had been changed, and we were 10 minutes late to check our luggage. We received no explanation, no courtesy, no solution. In fact, we were told very rudely that we weren't going anywhere today. For 20-30 minutes, we were given only this response and told to fly the next day. We had nowhere to stay, and two of us were just trying to get home to our kids. Turned out that only after we completely missed our flight, did the United employee reveal that there had been a seat on another flight going to our destination the whole time, so one of us could have flown on it with our bags as the other two caught our original flight. When we exhausted all options and finally agreed to fly the next day, we were suddenly told, sorry, no flights for TWO days! We were given not one drop of courtesy, hospitality, compensation, or compassion. We had to book last minute with another airline for the following day and borrow money for a hotel. We were out over $1,000! None of us nor our families will ever fly United again!",-1

Her and another member moved incredibly fast to assure my boarding. I was most impressed at how professional those ladies were and they should be rewarded in my opinion. From that point, the entire trip was a fantastic event all by itself. Every staff member and pilot was friendly and, well, upbeat I guess. Sure hope to do that again sometime. I thank all employees along my flight.",1

I was just doing my best to see to it that my mom was all set, and I am astonished at how well she was treated! From Houston IAH I put my mom on a flight where her final destination would be Zambia. The entire United Airlines crew stepped up and managed everything with such kindness and gentleness toward my mom, that I wanted to give them a shout out and say thanks to United Airlines for such exemplary client care!",1
2021-05-24,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Denver,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,This is the height of callous indifference to passengers,True," What is the United policy on cancelled changed flights? I was delayed coming from Pittsburgh to Denver Saturday, UA490, weather in Denver allegedly. I de-planed to find my the SFO flight took off 5 minutes later, we were told they were holding connecting flights. No more flights to SFO that night or in the morning out of Denver. Without asking me they booked me on the Reno flight leaving in 10 minutes, checked my bag there, all this without asking or giving me a chance to go to another CA city of my choice. They said take it or stay in Denver (offered nothing to do it). They offered me nothing for my trouble, no hotel voucher, no ticket voucher, no food voucher, nothing. They said I was on my own. My flight left from Reno to SF the next day (Sunday) at 10.45. I paid 120 bucks to stay in a hotel in Reno, my own cab fares to and from the airport, food etc. Weather or not (It's not like we know if was poor planning, delays of other kinds, everything is ""weather"" what proof would a passenger ever get?) I spent over 200 bucks out of pocket with no choice in my re-routing, etc. I wonder if my 16 year old daughter who flies alone sometimes would have just been put out on the street in Reno and told good luck by United like they did me? I have flown for 30 years many times with United, have United credit card etc. This is the height of callous indifference to passengers, there were others treated the same as me. United has some obligation to passengers and obligation to let them choose options, the gate agent told me ""it is what is"", funny they had checked my bag on the Reno flight before I stepped off the flight Pitt to Denver. I'm going to demand something for my trouble, never been treated so shoddy.",1
2021-05-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Denver via Kansas,,,,,,1.0,1,asked for assistance multiple times,False,"  Your treatment of my disabled friend was deplorable! We had to check in her walker, then in Denver on a layover you refused to let her use it. She had to be carted to her gate and made to sit and wait for hours without any way to get around, even to the restroom. We asked for assistance multiple times and none was ever given. I can only wonder how differently she would have been treated if she were your mother, instead of a customer.",-1
2021-05-22,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Green Bay,,,,,,1.0,1,ensure there are Skycaps ready,False,"  I have an elderly parent who was flying from Phoenix to Green Bay. She uses a walker and she had a roller bag. I drive her to Phoenix airport at 6:00 in the morning and we looked for a skycap. There was only one for Delta. Since it was my mom and me I had to leave my vehicle so I could assist her to get her boarding pass and also to secure the wheelchair for her. So I go into the airport and I see 2 ladies behind the United counter and I asked them can someone help her? One lady said you need to put your mask on. I said look just tell me who can help her so I can go to my car. No answer by that time I had a guy come up to me and tell me I needed to move my car. I told him as soon as I can find someone here to help my mom! So there was a lady at the Kiosk I believe for United. So in that moment I had to tell my mom to stay with her baggage and pray the lady was going to help her! I was very upset when I had to leave her standing not knowing if she was going to get help. United did not make this easy for my elderly parent traveling. She had a walker and a bag she needed to check and there was only 1 person at the Kiosk with quite a few people needing assistance. The bottom line is that in order for my mom to travel safely and efficiently there should have been a Skycap in front of the terminal for her situation. I’m not sure why there wasn’t but there needs to be one period. I can’t be the only one with an elderly parent traveling. But if there is no skycap then this is a 2 person situation. One in the car, one walking her and her bag into the terminal. So I kindly ask that United ensure there are Skycaps ready to facilitate the travel of an elderly person!",1
2021-05-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,First Class,Denver to Kona,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,2,the service levels were just not good,False,"  We were most disappointed in United's First-Class Service from Denver to Kona (non-stop). The aircraft being used is ""tired"" as the saying goes and the seating/armrests, etc really showed it. I thought we had paid quite a lot for First ($1600) one-way for the two of us and the service levels were just not good! Flight attendants on UA seem to be more interested in fraternizing with each other and treat customers (even in First-Class) with a condescension and an us against them atmosphere in spite of the fact that everyone on the plane (including the Crew I assume) had to have been tested for Covid within 72 hrs of the flight. The seating and entertainment were nice, but the meal was poor and when it came time for a snack (this was after all a 7.5 hr flight) we were told to ""only take one"" in a basket of pretzels, gummy bears, etc... we thought that was cheap to say the least - no smiles, no special service at all, no mention of beverages being available during the entire flight. We returned with Hawaiian Airlines a week later from Honolulu to San Francisco - the difference between the two was ""night and day"" - smiles, great food even to putting table cloths down on the trays before the main tray was delivered. Bottom line is either go Southwest (even to Hawaii) when you don't get much but likewise you generally spend a lot less or go Hawaiian (or anyone else really) and get what you paid for!",-1
2021-05-18,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Houston,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,rep didn't remove my first flight,True,"  The worse experience I've had with an airline. I have a flight set to leave at 10:25am. We arrive 5 min late to gate closure. Fine. It's my fault not my fault. Airport was crazy. I speak with United Airline rep and they set me up with standby for 12:15 flight I believe. My 2 boys and I, the day after my mom's funeral wait 2 hrs at new gate for possible standby. The rep calls for loading. No one comes for seats 1 or 2. Great we have a chance. I go to counter after rep calls all seats. Guess what? The prior rep didn't remove my first flight and set me up for standby so I missed that flight which had extra seats. Everyone in the airport had horrible attitudes and we were stuck.",-1
2021-05-18,0.8,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Washington to Fort Myers,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5,well handled by the crew,True," 
A Covidiot across the aisle from me in the same row refused to keep his mask on as he spoke loudly to the person seated next to him who appeared uncomfortable with him speaking to her mere inches away from her face without a mask. I leaned over and told him to please keep his mask on. He started berating me and asking me to show him a negative COVID test (which he apparently had). I told him that was irrelevant as FAA requires all passengers to wear masks when not actively eating or drinking. The next time a member of the cabin crew came down the aisle I informed her of the situation at which point she asked the man to keep his mask on. The crew member offered to re-seat me, although I preferred to stay where I was with my wife and son and for the offending passenger to just follow the rules. The flight attendant came back again to check on us and brought a dessert treat from first class for my son to enjoy and ensure me that she was keeping an eye on the rule-breaking passenger. Overall, well handled by the crew who I do not envy having to deal with Covidiots day after day. Flights on time, my million miler status acknowledged throughout and fast priority baggage delivery at both ends.",1

2021-05-16,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Anchorage to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,Absolutely the worst experience,False,"  Absolutely the worst experience. Flight from Anchorage to Denver was delayed over 2 hours due to a ""monitor light being on"" or at least that was the explanation given. Once the issue was cleared, we still sat with no movement for close to 30 minutes. Most of the passengers had connecting flights that were ""rescheduled"" however it was physically impossible to make the rescheduled flights as they were departing mere minutes after this plane landed. Thus, over an 8 hour wait at the Denver Airport for next connecting flight to Florida. The app is not helpful and updates are given at the last moment, if at all. Not flying United again and would not recommend to anyone who values their time.",-1
2021-05-15,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Richmond via Denver,1.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,5.0,4,communication would have gone a long way,True,"  My first flight out of Vegas was delayed on the tarmac for 45 minutes - which was problematic because I had a 55 minute connection in Denver. In fact, the flight attendant later announced that 146 of the 179 passengers on the plane had connections. I was very worried about missing my connecting flight, and so was everyone around me. Despite this, no announcements were made about connections on the plane, no updates came through the app, and the flight was just miserable due to everybody being anxious about being stranded overnight in Denver. As it happened, United delayed my plane just long enough for me to make the connection and avoid being stranded in Denver overnight, and when I checked the flight status later they did the same for everyone who was sitting near me, so I assume that almost everyone made their connecting flight. That was a really nice thing that United did. But I wish that they had made an announcement on the inbound flight that they were going to do that - it would have alleviated so much of the anxiety that everybody was suffering and made the flight much more bearable. A little communication would have gone a long way.",-1

I allowed myself 4 hours to drive a 2 hour route and 2 hours to get through security. But traffic had another idea and it ended up being over 5 hours of driving to get the airport. I got to the airport at 3:08 to catch a 4 o'clock flight. By the time I dropped off car rental and got to the United counter it was 3:25. The representative at the counter got this tired, upset, crying Meme checked in luggage done and on my way. After getting through security at 3:42 and making it to my gate at 3:47, doors still open though they were supposed to close at 3:45, I got on the plane with my 14 month old grandbaby and the flight attendant offered us a row all to ourself. In flight and about a hour from landing my grandbaby decided to get sick and the attendants went above and beyond to help me. What could of been and absolute disaster from the start before getting to the airport turned out to be a great feeling and knowing United had my back today helped greatly. and the",1
2021-05-09,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Very much disappointed,True," Very much disappointed, United Airlines Ground staff knows very well how to exploit customers and take advantage of a customers hard time. Staff handling the customer desk were too rude and totally unprofessional, quite not sure how United Airlines hires these ground staff who don’t have the basic etiquette to handle clients and ultimately brings in bad reviews and customer dissatisfaction for them. It was an early morning flight, myself and along with my family (spouse and 2 kids) got a flight at 7am from Atlanta to Newark. Reached airport around 3.45am EST to have enough buffer and for easy boarding. Approached United Airlines counter to get luggage checked in after entering all passport details, Customer desk lady started weighing the luggage and without any sense asked me to pay $1200 for extra luggage charge for hardly 1 lb extra on a few of my luggage. Not willing to listen to anything and when asked to allow sometime to adjust the luggage she literally gave an odd look and replied very rudely to move out from the queue. The customer rep should have some basic etiquette and consideration for the travellers who are with family especially with (3 year old kids). I moved out from the queue along with my family and made some adjustments on my luggage (by throwing a few on my items) to make it exactly 50 lb from 51 lbs and again queued up for check-in. This time also she was so rude as in I took her money back. Despite adjusting the luggage she charged me $400 extra and wasted 2 hours only in check-in queue. Now with only 1 hour left for flight to take off and security check yet to be completed, I was on the verge of missing my international flight but somehow managed to clear security check.",-1

On my most recent flight our trip to Nassau was delayed more than 4 hours, cause my daughter and I to miss an entire day of our vacation. United likes to board passengers without knowing if the plane is fit to fly. We sat on the plane for one hour before being told to deplane. We were then told each hour that our trip would be delayed another 30mins, until it reached a 4 hour delay. Very unhappy with United and would not suggest that anyone fly with them, if they can avoid it.",-1
2021-05-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cabo to Chicago via Milwaukee,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1,They lie to mislead the customers,True,"  After our flight was delayed 2x in Cabo San Lucas on our way home to Milwaukee which resulted in my husband & I missing our connecting flight in Chicago we were advised by a United Airlines Agent that there were no more flights out that evening to Milwaukee and they could put us up in a hotel, give us food vouchers, and get us on a flight in the morning, or to catch the Coach Bus in which they would reimburse us for. We opted to catch the Coach Bus which actually worked out really nice getting us home only an hour & a half later that the regular schedule. I went on line and applied for the $31/per person bus credit and this was the response from United: Hello Linda, I'm sorry that your trip didn't go as planned and regret your flight was delayed due to Air Traffic Control delays. Your time is valuable, and we always work to make sure your trip goes smoothly. I regret that the weather caused us to fall short in this instance. We understand the added travel time and expenses and regret any inconvenience it may create for our passengers. Our airport co-workers are expected to do all possible to minimize the inconvenience. We do not cover added expenses in situations that are beyond our control. As this flight interruption was due to Air Traffic Control, we are unable to cover your added expenses. Your understanding is appreciated. If you purchased Trip Insurance, please let me know and I can provide you with a Flight Verification Letter to provide them. My Response back: I was told by a United Airlines Agent that there were no more flights out that evening to Milwaukee and that we'd have to wait until the next morning. Our options were to get a hotel room and food vouchers competed by United and catch a flight the next day or take a bus competed by United. So what part of this am I not understanding? I would have to guess that a $31 per person to catch a bus back to Milwaukee would be cheaper then competing us a hotel room, shuttle, food vouchers and another flight back to Milwaukee. The airlines should be responsible for air traffic control / bad weather conditions resulting in their customers missing their next flight due to their original flight being delayed not once, but twice. Take responsibility already United .. geez! Again please credit me the full amount of the 1-way bus ticket for 2 people from Chicago to Milwaukee. My next step will be to contact a supervisor/manager at United. This is ridiculous. United Response Back to Me: I thoroughly understand your point of view and again wish to express our true regret. I can appreciate your request to escalate your concern and I understand that you did not consider United's first response satisfactory. I am afraid we can only reiterate and convey our policies which we will continue to support. While this is not the answer you were hoping for, your understanding is appreciated. They lie to mislead the customers. Everyone you talk to has something different to tell you & you spend hours on the phone trying to talk with something. Neverwill I fly United again. Shame - Shame on them! I'd give them a Zero at Customer Service if I could.",-1
2021-05-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Miami to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United Airlines customer service is a complete atrocity,True," United Airlines customer service is a complete atrocity. I contacted them on 4 separate occasion's asking about my flight from Miami to Chicago. Each customer service representative told me I will be refused to board the plane unless I had a negative Covid test result within 72 hours of my landing in Chicago. So you can imagine as much stress as I had I made sure that I got the test done but since I don't have covid symptoms I had to pay out of pocket a hefty price of $199. Upon arrival in the airport no one asked me for my results in everyone acted completely clueless. I was exceptionally upset contacted United Airlines customer support because it was them not anybody else that told me I had to have these results so that I would be able to board the plane. At first they wanted to blame it on Expedia then I clearly said it might email complaint it was their customer service I contacted directly with 4 separate representatives including a chat representative who told me was required in order for me to board the plane. Long story short I was told it's not their problem, I was misinformed and I was just going to have to eat the $199 I spent. I am writing this so you guys don't waste your time thinking that you have to have the test on before you get on the plane because their customer service don't take ownership of anything they tell you. I recommend that you record every call that you ever make with this airline and probably any airliner any customer service to protect yourself against all these lying self centred money hungry no accountability companies.",-1

Because of a line I waiting for a kiosk to open up for about 15 minutes. One kiosk was broken and the other 3 were being used. at 720 I attempted to check my bag and was denied from being able to due to the 45 minute window. A worker behind the counter immediately told me i couldn’t check my bag, or my car seat that I had from my two year old who was traveling with me and that he could put me on a 5pm flight. I told him the only reason I didn’t make the 45 minute window was because the line in front of me and he replied “that’s not my problem”. I was left leaving my bags and having to ship my daughters car seat. My mom stayed asking to speak with a manager and waited an hour and 25 minutes before someone came who then told her they would have let me check my bags if they’d known I was going home to my son who is sick. I typically fly delta with my family of 5 and have never experienced anything like this. They basically told me if I would have given them a pitty party they would have considered letting me check my bag.

My cousin and I had to fly out of Denver to St. Louis to get home. After arriving at the airport in Denver, our flight was delayed due to maintenance issues. After about 15-20 minutes of a delay, we were informed we had a 2 hour delay because our pilot “timed out.” After waiting the two hours we finally were able to board the flight. After sitting in the de-icing line for about 20 minutes, the pilot told us that the de-icing crew timed out and other crew on other United flights were going to time out so we had to wait in line for another 30 minutes to de-ice. After finishing the de-icing process, we were told that there was ice build up on an engine fan. After going back to a gate, getting off the plane, and waiting for another 20 minutes for the problem to be solved, we were allowed to board the plane. While the flight attendant was about to go over the safety card for the flight, the pilot told us there was no one to receive us in STL because everyone at the STL airport went home. At about 1am our flight was finally cancelled. After waiting in line at customer service to get a new flight for about an hour, I was told that if I booked a Southwest flight, I would be reimbursed for the United flight back to STL and the Southwest flight to STL. My cousin and I had to get on that early Southwest flight in the morning because I had final exams that week and he had work the night day and a United had no other flights until half way through the day. This flight was about 2 weeks ago. Since then United is still denying my request to be reimbursed, even though I was told by the lady at the United Customer Service that I would be. The email I received from United after my initial request said the flight was cancelled due to weather. Not once was weather mentioned as a reason for being delayed or cancelled to us. I will never be flying United again. They are a terrible airline full of excuses, lies, and awful customer service. I have always heard bad experiences with United from family and friends. I will never be flying with them again.",-1

2021-04-25,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Des Moines to Chicago,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,2.0,3,this airline keeps declining,False,"  To sum this up, United Airlines bit the dust so badly that it proven American Airlines to be a tad better than it. I am a frequent flyer and I have never seen an airline so bad like this except Spirit or Frontier. Not only they increased the usual time (it was a 1 hour 40 minute flight when it was supposed to be 1 hour 20 minute) but they didn't do anything as an apology and/or in return. The plane was disorganized and everything didn't really go smooth sailing. For once they did have a decent selection of drinks and food but that doesn't change the fact I literally have to use the finally provided television and magazines to get me through the flight. No matter how much extra stuff they bring, this airline keeps declining. Probably not going to fly United Airlines ever again.",-1

It made us miss our connecting flight which annoyed me, then they send us to Washington to catch a connection to Detroit, of course due to the delay we missed our connection so now we are stuck in Washington Airport until 10.30.

Got the run around sent back and forth from customer service to the boarding gate to situate seating issues. Got yelled at by the rep at the gate. Asked if there was a manager I could speak with but there was never an effort made to call one. Just more attitude and ignorance. No attention to detail no ability to listen no ability to defuse a situation which may be big on a air flight.,-1
2021-04-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Houston,2.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,the customer service agent was beyond rude,False,"  I called to possibly change my flight, and the customer service agent was beyond rude. I decided the fee to switch flights was not worth it, and the man argued with me about it. He was basically angry I wasted the entire 45 seconds of his time. Which was also him doing his job. He then hung up on me. I called back, asked speak to a supervisor, and was told there was a 2 hour wait for that. What? Gave my number for a call back, which never happened. Never again flying with them.",-1
2021-04-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Portland to Miami via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Changed me and my girlfriend's flight time,False,  Changed me and my girlfriend's flight time from 11.30 pm to the early afternoon of the same day without notifying us of this change in advance of us showing up to the airport. Then when called recommended I just go home despite being basically stranded at the airport. Our hotel and Air BnB reservations are now being wasted and we have lost a day of our vacation. Though they did change our flight to a 7 am one. I'm currently writing this with an 8 hour wait ahead of me at the airport.,-1

Flying has been my greatest fear! I was on flight UA1939 Tampa to Denver, FC seats 1a and 1 b, the flight crew recognized that I wasn't comfortable flying and stayed very attentive to me during the entire flight. I wasn't any less afraid but, this helped. Our trip San Francisco to Newark New Jersey was excellent, Polaris business class is worth the money!",1
2021-04-12,0.2,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Orlando to Denver,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,What is the use of buying a seat,True," I bought a ticket from Orlando to Denver one way on United flight 1596. In addition to the ticket cost $426, I paid $58 for my seat 15F. As I was boarding the lady at the gate gave me another boarding pass with the seat 11F. and told me she “moved me up to row 11”. I did not start an argument because I was travelling in an emergency and had to be in Denver. 1) My prepaid seat 15F was more expensive and spacious than 11F. 2) The gate agent could have asked me before changing my seat as I was at the gate almost an hour before departure. 3) What is the use of buying a seat if airline will not keep their end of the contract.",-1

First we were late leaving Columbia, MO due to lack of personnel. Then in Chicago we loaded and unloaded 2 times before being stranded for the night. The flight is scheduled for tomorrow morning. So I will be sleeping in the airport tonight. No accommodations was offered! This is totally unacceptable! I will not be flying United ever again!",-1
2021-04-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Liberia via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,United Airlines hasn’t even offered any compensation,True," We booked trips with friends to Costa Rica. On the way down they changed our flight to go through LAX with a super quick layover, while our friends were on a Houston layover flight. Our first aircraft seemed old compared to the ones we are used to on Delta. We made the flight in LAX to Costa Rica and then we were told that we would be waiting for a part that would take 30 minutes. (This second plane looked older too with no screens in headrests on an international flight). Then, after 20 minutes on the plane, they said we would need to deplane for a quick, easy repair. We exited the plane and they told us we would need to reboard our flight in 30-45 minutes. Needless to say, an hour later they let us know that we would be taking a different plane in 2-3 more hours. So here we sit, in a crowded terminal, with no real end in sight on our one vacation we take a year. Meanwhile, our friends, who somehow didn’t get bumped off our original flight through Houston, will get into the resort at least 6 hours before us. Also, we will incur the extra expense of having to take our own shuttle service (of over an hour) because we can’t split the cost of it with them because they don’t want to wait for us for endless hours at the airport. United Airlines hasn’t even offered any compensation, like they would have done on Southwest or Delta, had they delayed us this long.",-1
2021-04-10,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Omaha via Chicago,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3,missing items from my baggage,True,"  I have been a MileagePlus member for 7 years and have traveled numerous times with United and was mostly satisfied with their service. But on the last 12 months I have traveled 4 times and on 3 of this trips I have come home to find out missing items from my baggage. The first 2 claims were paid but my 3rd claim was denied according to the wording on the denial letter because I falsified/altered information. I explained to the representative that I probably misunderstood/overlooked the question and that it was not intentionally. I erroneously answered ""No"" to a question that should have been a ""Yes"" and for that I was treated as trying to commit fraud. I'm disappointed with United handling of my claim but I guess my mistake worked in their favor and they used it to avoid having to pay my claim. Anyone traveling with United should be very careful of safekeeping their valuable because the first time my property went missing from my checked baggage after that I decided to only pack my more valuable item on my carry-on to be on the safe side but on my connecting flight we were instructed to check our carry-on due to being a full flight and yes I came home to find out items from my carry-on were also missing. In my experience it not safe either way to pack my valuables while flying with United.",-1
2021-04-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Accra,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Avoid United if you can,False,"  United is an awful company to deal with. I found what was actually a competitively priced ticket to Accra from Denver with a couple of layovers. However, I booked the flight prior to the pandemic with no intention of cancelling prior to that time, but when it became clear that it was not safe to travel, especially out of the country, I cancelled as soon as possible. Had I not canceled, I would have been stranded and having to quarantine in another country with no one to take care of the two people in my care back home. Canceling was not an option I would have chosen under different circumstances, but this should have absolutely have been an exemption to the non-refundable ticket policy if flying after getting ill is. If I hadn't canceled, they would have had to cancel my return flight anyway, as international flights were being canceled at that time. United got bailed out by our tax payer dollars due to flight cancellations and the impact on the industry, however, this is a company that seems to think they are exempt from extending the same understanding under such unprecedented circumstances to their customers. After hours of sending emails and on the phone with customer service and supervisors, no one at United seemed to even acknowledge this being an issue. This is a company that seems to think it is entitled to your money without having to earn it. I still have never received a refund and a credit for a company that I have had such a bad experience with is laughable. Avoid United if you can. With as out of touch with its customers as it is, this is the sort of corporation that absolutely deserves to go out of business.",-1
2021-04-07,0.8,Family Leisure,Business Class,Cancun to Washington,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,United has really delivered,True,"  United has really delivered on my last two flights with them. Check-in is straight-forward and easy. Flights have been on time. Cabins have been clean. Inflight service is been good, despite reductions in service due to the pandemic. Crew friendly and helpful. Bags all made it to their destination with priority bags coming off first. Yesterday from Cancun to Dulles, my son and I were upgraded thanks to my Million Miler status on a route with few paid first class passengers (mostly vacationers). The processing of the required COVID test results into UA's system was straight forward. While nothing to do with UA, Global Entry on arrival at Dulles was a breeze particularly now that it uses only facial recognition. We were in the car and heading home within 45 minutes of wheels down. No complaints.",1

Show up to print my boarding passes and come to find they changed me to only window seats. Literally paid money to not have window seats and that's all they give me.

When we bought the tickets we didn’t know that we can take carry on. We had to pay for our luggage at SFO and double the amount when leaving Guatemala City. It is unfortunate to have all the hidden charges. We spent approximately $500 just in luggage fees.,-1
2021-03-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Burlington,2.0,,3.0,,,3.0,2,I will pay more in the future to avoid them,True," United Airlines customer service and policy is atrocious. I booked a flight for a friend and we canceled due to COVID concerns. The ticket was paid for on my card, through my account. I later booked a flight using that canceled credit. Unfortunately I was never prompted to change traveler info and assumed it was under my name since it was through my account. This was not the case. When I attempted to get a simple name change for the flight I was told repeatedly I would need a new ticket. When I asked the purpose of their ""non transferable"" ticket policy I was met with silence and reiteration of the policy. The only thing this policy serves is to generate income. I was awarded a ""certificate"" that came conveniently after my travel so I was forced to be locked into a second flight with United. This is an underhanded tactic to scam customers into either paying for nothing and letting it go or paying twice locking you into more money with United. During a time of global crisis when people haven't seen family in literal years, United shines as a beacon of corporate greed with sour business tactics. Customer service was poorly educated and issue elevation to management was denied repeatedly. Once I use the certificate I will avoid United at all costs. I will pay more in the future to avoid them and deny them my business.",-1
2021-03-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Portland,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline I’ve ever been on,False,"  Worst airline I’ve ever been on. This is not my first terrible experience. They book your flights so close together that you almost always end up missing your next flight if there is any delay. It’s impossible to book something the next day. They book you for the following day and will not comp you food or hotel because they’ll blame weather. We got a new flight for the following day and then they couldn’t find that ticket In their system. They’re rude customer service, the flight staff asked to hold my baby and one even touched my babies head and tried again multiple times. Hello it’s a pandemic! The Supervisor at Denver airport was not helpful and honestly couldn’t care less.",-1

I booked a flight for our whole family 2 adults, a 1.5 yrs old, 6 yrs old and 9 yrs old. I wanted to check in in advance and I have noticed that United assigned my 1.5 yrs old baby to sit apart from us. I called the customer service to ask them to find us new seats so we can be seated together. The rep told me that she can not find any seats that we can sit all together and we must be separated, I explained her that due to covid 19, we must be seated together so we will make sure the kids are following all guidelines - then I asked to be transferred to a supervisor, and also she told me she can’t help me! This is outrageous! United are separating parents from their children - this is just unbelievable",-1
2021-03-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ft Lauderdale to Chicago,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Disgusted in the service,True,"  I cannot believe how I was treated when I arrived to Fort Lauderdale airport to depart to O'Hare International Airport. I am a single mother traveling with the rest of my family (who was dealing with their own issues with the weight of baggage (they were unable to help me manage two small children). Previously when trying to check in my car seats (which they do not sit in on the actual plane), I would have zero issues with the person who would be checking my baggage in tagging them and letting me on my way. This time (both from Ohare to Fort Lauderdale and then coming back) the staff sent me and my 2 very young children on a wild goose chase. So, instead of taking the car seats and making it easier for me to travel essentially on my own. Anyway, I was told from the front desk of United Airlines by their staff that ""they don't do the tags that I would need to go back to a kiosk and do it myself"" Wonderful way to pass the buck on me. I went to the kiosk after wrangling in my kids to stay put in a busy airport, the week of spring break, to only discover that a staff member would have to come to the kiosk to assist me in getting the tags printed. So after waiting and almost losing my 3 and 7 years old a few times someone finally was able to make their way to me to help. After doing so, the tags were printed with her non so helpful attitude told me to go back into the same line I came out of to drop off my car seats. Can someone please tell me how this is a productive way of doing things? How you can look at a single mother of two young kids traveling during a busy time to tell them to jump through firey hoops, only to end up where she started? Disappointing and the lack of compassion is obvious. Disgusted in the service.",-1

Okay wtf, now I have to call and reschedule a whole new flight while already being late for my business trip. Now on my flight back home everything is going fine I got on the plane and into my seat. ""I'm sorry passenger we will be delaying the flight for 30 mins due to awaiting for passengers that have their flight delayed"" ""I'm sorry passengers we will be further delaying the flight for an additional 30 minutes due to waiting for those passengers"" Absolutely ridiculous!

Upon buying my ticket, I saw that my last flight had 3 stops for a total of 20 hours. When I called to cancel or change my ticket, Priceline directed me to cancel through United. After contacting United, I was met with the same answer. Priceline again refused to cancel my ticket. After numerous attempts, I called United and asked if they could change my flights. I offered to be flexible with my dates and airports - I even offered to pay for the difference in fares. United claimed they could do absolutely nothing since I had bought the ticket elsewhere. They are expecting me to fly 20 hours without any effort to help my situation. Now I have to take the loss, buy another ticket so I can get vaccinated accordingly. I will be buying my ticket with another airline.",-1

My wife and I felt that we needed a vacation one last time before the end of our lives. We are both in our late 60's. We booked our return flight with United Airlines. The week before our flight, my wife had a terrible reaction to one of her medications. We considered going to the ER for 2 days. Our family doctor felt he was not equipped to handle her case and she needed to see a specialist. We are currently trying to get in to see someone. I called United and said that we were unable to use our tickets. (flights are not leaving for almost 2 weeks) (return from vac). My real concern would be if someone canceled because of Covid symptoms. Would they finally say screw it, it is not worth the hassle of trying to get my money back. I am going to use the flight! Interesting to say the least.",-1

The boarding order is frustrating, the paying for seat selection. We got the seats in front of the exit aisle that can’t recline and without extra leg room. The flight was hot and crowded. Someone was vaping some terrible smell. There was no drink service. Plenty of water but no other options provided. The WiFi cut out so often you couldn’t use the private screening they love to advertise.",-1

I could not able to get my boarding pass online, neither at the kiosk at Newark airport. When I found an employee, she was not helpful at all. I had to go to a desk and see an associate. She checked everything and said “You did not pay for the flight, so United won’t give you a boarding pass tonight.” I showed her my the credit card charge and the confirmation received in email. She said she does not see on her system that I had paid for it. Then she called someone, had my card verified and charged the fare again. This entire thing took 45 minutes. I bought this ticket 2 days prior to flying and if United had any issues in terms of payment, why did they never send me an email? Cabin was fine, but cabin crews did not smile, worked as robots. IFE, seats, interiors looked stunning. Selection of movies was limited. Food options were limited too. I don’t want to fly with United but there’re not many options out there to fly non-stop to Delhi.",-1
2021-03-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Orlando,,,,,,,1,United just lost a loyal customer,False,"  I originally booked a non stop flight from SFO to MCO on April 1,2021. I have a group of 12 passengers flying with United at the same time on the same flight. United has changed my flight without a notification. The reason I selected the non stop flight is due to my daughter has anxiety traveling. Now we have a stop in IAH which I did not want to stop. The changes to this flight requires us to get a hotel now which is a big inconvenience. We were arriving in MCO at 7:15am on 4/2/21. Now United has us traveling for 8 hours with a stop in IAH and arriving in MCO at 11:00pm on 4/1/21. I have to make a lot of changes to my schedule with a group of 12 passengers. This is not considered to the passengers who made the reservation and booking the flight red eye so folks will not miss work nor school. I have to change my transportation to the airport. The reason its so upsetting is because we had other options to travel with. Now we stuck traveling with United due to prices has went up on other airlines. This is the 2nd time United has changed my flight within a year to what its best for them. The reason for booking ahead of time is for proper preparation. I never received a email notification but I did received the confirmation email. Trying to address the issue with United. I was on hold for 45 minutes. United just lost a loyal customer.",-1

Now they changed my flights later to go there and earlier to come back, without any compensation for the surcharge we paid for our specific flights.

We had a flight booked for Florida during April, but the pandemic hit and the hotel canceled our reservations and our State went on a mandatory lock down. Called the Airline and these awful people said, well we are still flying so we won't give you a refund. We tried to apply for a refund online - denied. A year later clearly still the world is fighting the pandemic, but now I lost my job. We can't afford a vacation, not for years to come. Called them again. They lied and said they would give me a refund. Lied. A guy said he was a manager gave me his name said to wait two weeks. Two weeks later nothing happened. Called them again. 2 hour wait time. No one knows who he is because they use ID numbers and no notes on my account. Told me to speak to a ""Refund Department"". They transfer me and the department closed the moment they transferred. Called again. Same crazy situation. Same horrible wait time. Finally got to someone. She was worse than speaking to a robot. For the fourth time I had to explain what was going on. She gave me another bogus number to call. On hold with them now. It keeps saying my hold time is greater than 60 minutes. United Airlines, you are awful and horrible.",-1

I have flown a few times before only to be nickel and dimed for everything little thing from start to finish. I promised myself I would NEVER fly them again, but then found myself booking a flight due to their ""COVID refund policy"" assuring refunds or flight changes would be issued. Well, guess what, not the case. They have changed our flight three times in the past month (without out permission) and this time was the last straw. This time the change did not fit with out travel plans so I called for a refund. I was told over and over again they could not refund to my original credit card, but only for a travel voucher. Let me remind you they moved us from a $430.00 one way ticket (direct flight that we paid extra for on purpose) to a multi stop flight that took multiple days to get back to Denver. These tickets are about 250$ when I look today. They refused to refund the difference in fare change or refund the tickets. I asked for either of these options and was refused and told they could not do either. Absolutely disgusting and criminal and these people should be sued. I know I am not the only one as I read other reviews. United Airlines is a horrible company and does not care about their customers.",-1

As being immediate family (parents of the Canadian citizen), we did not need IRCC authorization form. In fact it doesn’t exist. IRCC authorization is only mandatory in the case of extended family visitation. We flew same day, through Alaska Airline, Delta Airline, and Air Canada from Orlando International Airport to Canada.

Two were plane problems and the other one was crew didn’t get enough sleep. So a five hour trip turned into a 24 hour ordeal. I see weather conditions but the crew and plane come on United you only got two flight crew and a couple of planes. Also was told temperature check not one person got checked full planes right on top of each other. We are in the middle of a pandemic, we were only was flying because my husband got transferred jobs. I have MS so I was counting on them to follow the safety rules. We will never fly United again.",-1
2021-02-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Milwaukee,,,,,,1.0,1,My flight to Milwaukee got canceled,True,"  My flight to Milwaukee got canceled around 530pm, so I requested my check in bags around 545pm so that me and my girlfriend can take the bus home instead. 9pm hits and we waited almost 4 hours and nothing, so I requested an airline worker to look up my baggage. And guess what? They threw me and my girlfriend's baggage on another flight that departed to Milwaukee without us! So now it's late and we can't even catch a bus back home. We're stuck here overnight in the Chicago Airport with no food, no bed, no blankets, and it's Cold up in here! We can only hope and pray that our luggage (there's two of them) will still be at the Milwaukee Airport when we arrive there tomorrow! And we can only pray that we will be safe here at Chicago O Hare!",-1

The lady that helped me was Emily and she was very helpful and has great customer service skills. Thank you United!",1
2021-02-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Oklahoma City,,,,,,,1,keep shooting themselves in the foot,False,"  United just doesn’t get it. In world of COVID other airlines are focusing on customer service, United just keep shooting themselves in the foot! They waive change fees which is great ; however, if you book a business or economy ticket they won’t let you change the ticket for a lower class fare like basic economy. They make you pay more for a rebooking flight even though basic economy may be available. Racket to make more money with no customer focus.",-1
2021-02-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kearney to Seattle,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will not be flying United personally or for my business,False,"  I bought ticket with insurance for my daughter. Prior to flight my 2nd daughter came down with covid. Due to the fact that my daughters were in contact with each other none of them could fly home. The insurance I purchased on United Airlines website, they deemed it not eligible for a refund, even though it met 4 of the standards for a refund. United Airlines refused to stand behind the company they have associate with on their website. I guess they would rather my daughters fly and take a chance of infecting others than them or their associates honoring health and cdc guidelines. They just wanted to offer up a voucher not the refund I paid for nor the amount of the insurance cost. Needless to say I will not be flying United personally or for my business, and will encourage others the same.",-1

As far as the flight experience, it was horrible, I have never seen such a rude flight attendant. They care more about security theater, then the consumer itself. Companies that are extremists about the masks will automatically get a negative review. I’m the consumer, I hope my voice is heard. I will not be flying with United Airlines anymore.",-1

At the end of the check-in process, the notification said because I purchased an economy ticket AND I’m not checking a bag, I have to check-in at the counter so they can see I’m not bringing a bag. That is the most ridiculous policy ever! I’m guessing people end up paying the $30 as if they were checking a bag to get their boarding pass without having to stand in line at the airport. A back handed way to get more money.",-1

2021-02-08,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Reservation people was clueless,True,"  I will never purchase tickets from that line, even I got my next ticket In first class. Originally I ordered my tickets from online booking company, but decided to upgrade them to economy plus. I called to United and ask them to upgrade my tickets. Paid for extra room seats and paid. I received seats assignments with seats # 11E, 11F two ways. Spoke with a friend and she suggested to upgrade to Exit Row. I called United on the same day and asked for another upgrade to exit row. And then it started. Reservation people was clueless how to do that, a free and screaming at me also dropping the phone on me. After 4 call I finally got online manager and she for the fee upgraded my tickets to to exit row. She assigned sits to 21E, 21F. I print out new tickets. Today I made an check in online and print out boarding tickets to Tampa and fess what. I had all’s seats 11f and 11b. And by Calling back to United was told that Newark airport assigning seat. They think that customers are stupid people and they don’t know for what they paying extras. Also she told me that my seats taken for that flight, but on the way back I will have my seats 21E, 21F.",-1
2021-02-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Rock Springs,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,given a “reduced” travel coupon,True,"  First of all, I get it, this is regional flight and things happen, but we were forced to return to DIA mid flight because power at the RKS airport was knocked out due to high winds. Again, things happen and I’m not even mad about that. Where United dropped the ball, is when we arrived back at DIA. We were given a “reduced” travel coupon from some affiliate they use and doing a quick search using other hotel booking apps immediately left you confused as to why United would even give these to you as an option because the prices using there “coupon” were $30-$40 higher than Priceline/hotels.com. Then after having to come back to the airport at 630 in the morning, we’re delayed over an hour because the captain and first officer couldn’t make it in time for the flight. We’re all here, why can’t they be?  Do yourself a favor and rent a car from DIA if your flight to RKS is ever canceled and you’re forced to fly with these idiots. I wish I had four hands, so I could United/Skywest four thumbs down.",-1
2021-02-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Denver via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst experience flying ever,False,"  My flight was scheduled for 8.20. It was around 17 degrees F and had been for some days now. I get to the airport and waited an hour. 8.00 comes and an announcement is made that the flight will be delayed until 9.30 due to pipes freezing. Understandable. Then 9 comes and another announcement, saying they need only 30 mins to make sure water has proper circulation. I can get with that. Then 9.45 comes and it's delayed again, with no reason given as to why, and we're told a ""rescue"" plane from Chicago is coming. Around 10.15, we were all assigned a new gate. At 10.30 it was delayed again because the new plane would be late. It takes an hour from Grand Rapids to Chicago flying. At this point we would miss our connecting flight so we rebooked and got new checked luggage tickets. Then 11 came and it was too late to make it to the new, rebooked flight. So we rebooked again, got new ticket stubs, and made it work. Then we get on the plane around 12.30 and are told there's yet another delay because the plane next to us (was on time) needed to be turned off first so the workers could come to ours. Worst experience flying ever and will recommend literally any airline to anyone besides United.",-1

I sent in documentation that date and was sent to a secure website that didn't work by the help desk. Figured the website was down. Went to go submit it again a week before my flight and they wouldn't accept it because apparently the rules changed and they needed the documentation on January 10th. Nothing was said about this during my January 7th correspondence and now I am stuck not being able to fly. The customer service is outrageous. I even had email documentation of this occurring and they wouldn't approve. You ever want any actual help, good luck.",-1
2021-02-06,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Houston (IAH),2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,"They were all very lovely, very laid back, helpful and cheerful",True," We flew United UA1872 from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Houston (IAH) on January 13th 2021, the last leg of trip back home to Houston from a Family trip to SE Asia. We spent time at O'Hare's United Club in Terminal 1 after transferring from Terminal 5 International arrival and stayed there for a couple hours waiting for our flight. The gate to our flight is just a few doors down from the lounge so we waited until boarding time before we leave the lounge. Boarding was done very orderly, First Class were called first then Economy were called by rows from back to front. Interesting concept of preventing Covid-19 transmission in this single aisle plane, letting First Class passengers get exposed to all Economy passengers passing them on their way to the back of the plane. Had this been a widebody this concept might work if Economy passengers entering from the second door, bypassing the First/Business Class passengers up front. It's obvious we are on an American carrier from the very tight pitch of seats, very different from Asian carriers we used in the past few weeks. The plane was clean even though it is kind of old (19 years - registration N37267). We used Clorox wipes to sanitize the tray table, armrest, seatbelts and screen when we got to our seat. We're back in the US so this is very important and it is something we have to do to keep ourselves safe! Movies and TV series from United's inflight entertainment program is enough for this short (2 hours) flight. I lost my wireless transmitter while transferring in Chicago O'Hare so I have to use one of the free headphones given by the FAs. The FAs on this plane are two older gentlemen and two older ladies. They were all very lovely, very laid back, helpful and cheerful. From how they help and interact with their passengers you can tell that they like their job. One of the FAs was even cracking jokes when she was making pre-departure announcement. I'd take them in a heartbeat over 95% of all other UA FA's that I have met in the past! The FAs were also very nice and approachable. They were open to chit chat when I was standing in the back galley stretching while waiting for a restroom. We were given sanitizing wipes when we were boarding, and a goodie bag with pretzels, stroopwafel and a small water bottle after take off. Then the FAs making rounds with the drink cart midway through the flight. We left 10 minutes behind schedule but arrived at 8.25 pm, around 34 minutes earlier than scheduled. Deplaning was done quick and very orderly, the FAs calling the rows to stand up to pick up our carry on and deplane while others behind were asked to stay seated, so there was no rushing or a line to deplane. It was an uneventful flight but the FA's cheerful and helpful disposition gives a good impression about United that they are improving their service. Hope we can have more of the FAs like the ones on this flight to change the general perception about United's Flight Attendants, especially the more senior ones!",1
2021-02-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,they do not care about their customers at all,False,"  Do not fly United Airlines if you think that your trip may be cancelled due to COVID. They will not refund you for any flights. Instead, they will give you travel credit. But, what they do not tell you is that you must spend that flight credit all at once or you will lose the remaining balance. For example, if your original flight cost $1000 and your new flight is $400, you will loose the remaining $600. They will not refund any COVID related cancelation, and I can only assume it is because they simply want to steal it from us and convince us it's our fault that they aren't accommodating for the circumstances of a pandemic. I don't know about you all, but in these times, when millions of people have been suddenly unemployed and possibly in need of their money back, this feels truly disgusting. You can tell they do not care about their customers at all. At least I know with other companies (like Delta) that I can get a true refund for circumstances that are out of my control.",-1
2021-02-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Eugene via Colorado,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,do not depend on their customer service to be reliable,False,"  I was set to travel on 2/4/2021 at 7:10 from Houston, TX to Eugene, OR to visit my family. Coming with me were my two cats. I called customer service three separate times to insure I would have everything I needed for them set and ready to go. The first person I spoke with told me the kitties would need medical records, heath certificates and a rabies vaccine within 30 days of flying out. The second person I spoke with reiterated the first, and the third person I spoke with told me the only thing I would be needing is the rabies within 30 days of my flight and that's it. So when I get to the airport, they tell me the rabies has to be 30 days or older to fly, not within 30 days of the flight. I explained that the representatives I spoke with told me otherwise, and she was very nice about telling me they were wrong, but I was still upset, naturally. So I decided I would call customer service to tell them what happened and when I spoke to a supervisor I was told I should have went to the website regardless of what a representative told me to verify that their representative had the correct information. What is the point of the customer service line if what they say can, at any point, be incorrect information? This is unacceptable. Because they can't train their employees correctly I have now had to reschedule my flight, my work schedule and my personal life schedule and they don't seem to care about that all. So beware - if there is information you are trying to find out about what is needed for you to fly - do not depend on their customer service to be reliable and give correct information.",-1
2021-02-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Mexico City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,become nothing but a disappointment,False,"  Just sharing my experience for anyone interested in flying with United.  Flew into Mex City with my family with a transfer flight needed to go to another city. After repeated calls to United before my flight letting them know that 30mins is not enough time to go through Customs, Security, and Covid procedures, multiple United reps assured me that it was plenty of time. Of course, we missed our flight and we were stranded in a city where we dont speak the language. Cost us $563 in hotel, cab fare, and lost Air bnb $. Submitted claim to ""Customer Care"", takes them 14 business days to even respond and when they do they said ""we care"" and ""we understand"" but in the end, and a month later with delayed responses, United has become nothing but a disappointment and burden to myself and my family, caused serious stress and anxiety to my family that should have been avoided. Expected much more and received so much less than I thought.",-1
2021-02-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Hong Kong,,,,,,,1,literally robbing and scamming people,True,"  United Airlines is the worst airline ever. I had a trip back to my home last July and they delayed it for a day, then canceled it altogether. I found out they canceled it the night before I was supposed to fly, so I called for a refund and the lady said I would get it back to my credit card in 7-10 days. But it has been 7 months and still nothing. I've filled out the form, repeatedly emailed to no response. I called them two more times after that and the first time they said they transferred my request to HK quarters and wait for an email to be sent to me, and the second time they said they denied my refund and check my email for the reason. There was NO email whatsoever. The worst thing? My friend was on the same flight as me and she got her refund months ago. The only difference is she has a green card and I don't. They're literally robbing and scamming people. What kind of airline denies a refund to a flight they canceled?",-1
2021-01-31,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Vancouver,,,,,,,1,need to be a little softer and kinder,True,"  This would have been my first time traveling with United Airlines and I do not think I would ever book with them again. I purchased 7 tickets to go to Vancouver in March 2020 but was unable to go because of the COVID-19, I called pleading for a refund because I did not want to take a chance and travel knowing their health issue. My dad has bladder cancer and prostate cancer and is taking chemotherapy, whilst my husband is a type 2 diabetic. When I found out that we would not be able to travel, I called and explained everything, I wrote a letter explaining to them the situation and they turned me down, they forced me to reschedule and I did. Would would have thought after a year we would still be going through this pandemic. When I called back to reschedule I had to pay $35 extra on each tickets to rescheduled for March 2021. We all know that COVID-19 is not getting any better after a year, I called again January 30 2020 after watching the Canadian news saying that nobody should plan on coming over to Canada and that they are closed until April 30, I immediately call and begged and pleaded and no one had a heart, they would still want us to travel know the situation. A customer service representative tried to help me by talking to his manager trying to allow me to at least get back some money.  The customer service representative came with a plan saying he would refund me all of the money but I would have to pay for a cancellation fee of $100 each which would be $700 because it’s was 7 of us traveling. I didn’t used United Airlines service and we didn’t cause the coronavirus. We are all hurting from this pandemic and here they are telling me I have to pay $700 upfront for them to give me back my $2300 for the tickets. This is so unfair. In July of last year I was to travel with JetBlue and because of the pandemic we couldn’t and JetBlue gave me an option to reschedule or I would get a refund of course I accepted the refund, no issue no problems they were kind enough to refund all of my money because they understand and they have a heart. United airlines I cried when I had to pay that money because we are in need of extra money during this time. I still have a job thank God but my hours are being cut. I take care of my father and my mother and my 2 boys with the little much I have and if they can’t travel then I can’t travel. In this time people need to be a little softer and kinder.",-1
2021-01-31,0.2,Business,First Class,Milwaukee to Houston,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,recalcitrant attitude that I abhor,True,"  I understand many things as a professional who travels extensively for a living. However, one thing I do not is nearly zero inflight attentiveness by these lazy Flight Attendants .On my recent Milwaukee to Houston first class flight, getting any beverage like even a coffee or some water was a huge challenge and hassle. It's this recalcitrant attitude that I abhor. Why isn't it just offered instead of nearly having to beg for such a simple concept? Then you have to engage in this silly little game of who will hand off OR whether the F/A will pick up OR set it down onto your fold out seat tray table? This is just a poor attitude. I know that the airlines are suffering greatly from the COVID19 pandemic. Although, you'd think that they want to double down on what they could do to keep their customers happier? Especially the loyal frequent travelers. No way. This was a Republic Airlines operated (but billed as a United Airlines flight). About the only thing positive I can honestly write here is that the first class seat is a welcome asset. Aside from the other hassles of air travel these pandemic days! I will also say that I think the risks are quite low.",-1
2021-01-29,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tokyo Narita,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,2.0,4,getting better in their service these days,True,"  This is the second leg of a trip to SE Asia booked under ANA. ANA used to have a daily SFO-NRT flight but due to Covid-19 they reduced their schedule and we were transferred to United for the SFO-NRT leg on 12/30/20. Our flight from IAH arrived early so we have enough time to transfer. When we arrived at the boarding lounge the gate agents made us line up and check our travel documents before we were told we can take a seat. The process was slow and very ineffective; there are 5 gate agents but seems only 2 out of 5 agents know what to do since the other 3 older ladies always have to call and refer with the two guys for each and every passenger they are working with! Boarding was done from back to front and they call passengers by row so there is no crowding around the gate. Mask is to be worn at all times in the boarding area and during the flight except when eating and drinking. Prior to entering the air bridge was stopped by an air Marshall and was asked regular questions for the trip like cash we carry etc. since the region we are visiting is considered prone to financial issues. The kid was young and wasn't too experienced so initially he was kind of gruff; but after a while he warms up and even wishes us a safe trip. The metal was relatively new, clean and bright, and passenger load is around 30-40% so the flight attendants were able to move people around for social distancing so each of us can have a row of 3 seats for ourselves. The entertainment system is quite good and have lots of options. We used our own wireless transmitter and bluetooth earphones to avoid all the cable tangle from the provided earbuds. We always travel with Clorox wipes to clean armrest, tray tables, screen, seatbelt etc. but on this flight United also provides disinfectant wipes that we use to clean the seating area. The FAs were very helpful. They are not as approachable, charming or polite like their Asian counterparts, but they ensure we got what we need from them. We were given the snack package like what we got on earlier flight (pretzel, stroopwafel and water) right after boarding. After take off, the drink cart start making their round, and we were given a decent lunch right after. During the flight there is another dinner/heavy snack hand out and two drink runs done before we make our descent to Tokyo. Like the connecting flight we had before this one, this United flight also considered a good experience for us. The FAs are nice and helpful (unlike the grumpy people I've encountered many times over in their international flights) and they try to impose social distancing, the plane was clean and spacious, the entertainment system has enough content to keep us busy throughout the trip, and the fact that we all can catch some sleep due to having a row to ourselves makes this trip quite nice. Looks like United is getting better in their service these days.",1
2021-01-29,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to San Francisco,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,they're doing a good job in trying to ensure social distancing,True," This flight on 12/31/20 from IAH to SFO using UA metal is the first (domestic) leg of a family trip to SE Asia booked under ANA. This is one of the morning flights at 7:30 am that require us to arrive early for the passport check and the PCR test results check required for our entry to our destination. Check-in was helped by a very nice lady who ensure none of our bags were overweight and let us shift stuff between bags to balance the weights between bags. That same lady was helping with the boarding process at our gate. United requires all passengers to wear a mask all the time when we were checking in, at the gate and at all times during the trip, except when we are eating or drinking. Boarding was done by rows from back to front, and gate agents announced it beforehand so everyone knows when they turn is coming and there is no rushing towards the gate. Very organized. We always carry some clorox wipes with us when we're flying that we use to clean the armrests, seatbelt, tray table, screen etc. since we didn't think the airline would provide the wipes. After we board, we were given sanitizing wipes, so we can use that instead of Clorox. Good job, United! We were given a package of pretzel and stroopwafel and a small bottle of water. Later there is a drink cart making rounds for people who wants to drink other than water. The seatback screen is loaded with enough entertainment to keep us busy during the 3.5 hours flight. We were provided 3.5"" earphones but we used our own wireless transmitter and bluetooth earphones to avoid all the cable tangle. The only minor issue is the built-in remote for the entertainment on the armrest that is not very responsive, but didn't prevent us from using the entertainment system. The FAs were quite cheerful and helpful, and they have good interactions with all passengers. A flight attendant was offering my seatmates if they wanted to move seats to another seat close by for social distancing since the flight was not full. Looks like they're doing a good job in trying to ensure social distancing - if the space is available. Flight deck updated us on the expected flying time before we leave, and also communicated on the expected arrival time and gate before we descend. The flight left only a few minutes behind plan and arrived in SFO 36 minutes early, giving us ample time for our 1:25 hours transfer between Terminal 3 and International Terminal. This is one of the good flights with United. The FAs are nice cheerful and helpful, and the communication from flight deck is informative. Looks like United have begin to change the corporate culture towards the right direction.",1

For United, it brought out the worst. I’m currently sitting on a flight from Chicago to San Francisco with 30-40 other passengers and we’ve all been assigned seats in the back of the plane, packed together, while there are dozens of rows free and available just in front of us. So naturally, when everyone starts asking if we can be spread out so, you know, we lower our chances of infecting each other, they want to charge a $90 extra to move people up. When a couple passenger pointed out that it’s messed up to keep people close by during a global pandemic and that they were concerned about their health, the flight attendants’ response was that they couldn’t do it because of weight distribution, an issue that could have been avoided in advance by planning to spread people in the plane. Cherry in the sundae, before the flight takes off, the attendants starts reciting their corporate safety headlines, underlining how they’re taking extra steps to keep everyone safe, contrasting with the passengers herded in the back of the airplane. United Airlines literally profiting off people wanting to stay safe during a global pandemic.",-1
2021-01-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Montreal,,,,,,1.0,1,rejected at the airport 2 times,False,"  Total incompetence, ignorance, irrigant. I cannot rate the flight coz I never got on it. I spent entire days with United reps tell me how I could send my sick wife to Canada to see her mother ailing and dying. I spoke with 2 different reps both of them were incorrect and I was rejected at the airport 2 times based on their information given. I can say nothing other than this is your worst experience in my life, these people are uncaring. They said its non refundable. They did say I could have another flight and credit towards it but when you do that you come up with an extra $2000 because of their new price for tickets.",-1
2021-01-21,0.2,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Phoenix to Washington via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,involuntary downgrade me from first class,True,"  Here is my email to United’s poor customer service after a recent and unfair overbooking matter that led them to involuntary downgrade me from first class and not compensate me for my inconvenience as they promised. In fact the customer care lady seemed pretty rude and determined not to give me an answer as to why they overbooked my seat even though I never bought insurance so there was not chance for me to cancel: Dear X, My experience talking to you today has unfortunately left me with a very poor impression of the customer care team at United Airlines. First and most importantly, you failed to answer why my ticket, that I rightfully bought and reserved, with no insurance (so there was no chance of canceling on my end), was involuntary downgraded. Clearly United failed to provide a reasonable answer and this leads me to think it is a clear consumer/passenger abuse, JUST because the airlines can do so, given their small yet powerful concentration of market power. It was clearly incentivized due to making that extra margin from my seat having been sold to someone willing to pay more. What will remain with me is your reply to saying “we cannot answer you as to why we overbooked”. Policies as they are remain because of the failure of the DOJ to look into these matters as abuses. While I was forced to accept the unfair refund amount today, I will make sure that if there are class actions and lawsuits arising in the near future with matters relevant to refunds related to overbooking at United, I will be the first to join. Needless to say I will work on investigating this matter moving forward.",-1
2021-01-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Tampa via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United delayed us for nearly 9 hours on a one-hour flight,False,"  United delayed us for nearly 9 hours on a one-hour flight due to a technical issue they had on their plane. Most of the hours were spent inside the plane, which is annoying for a 6’2” guy and is more than annoying during a pandemic. I reached out to United customer support and for the nearly nine hours of delay, they gave me thirty five dollars worth of miles. That means United values my time, lack of comfort, and lack of safety at roughly four dollars worth of miles per hour. Wow!",-1
2021-01-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,impossible to talk to an actual human being,False,"  I was extremely sick with Covid and had to cancel my trip. The amount of my credit was more than the cost of one flight, but they wouldn’t let me use it. I wanted the remainder to go towards my flight home but I couldn’t. They’re basically robbing people. They told me a supervisor would call me within 72 hours and it’s been way longer and still no phone call. I contacted them again through their “virtual chat” and they said they’d have a supervisor call me in 72 hours. No. I’m not sitting around for another two days waiting for someone to possibly call me. They make it so impossible to talk to an actual human being! They’re awful. I don’t know how they’re even still in business!",-1
2021-01-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Minneapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I would not recommend this airline,False,  Let’s just start off with how they cancelled our flight. “Due to lack of command”. We had connecting flights and they still made us get our luggage and check them in once again. After going through all that come to find out our flight home is cancelled. And we had no clue or no updates sent to us. So we had to spend the night in Chicago. They showed no empathy at all and were careless and disrespectful about our concerns. The next morning we get there to catch our flight and they claim we have too many carry on bags mind you this was not an issue for our other flight. We spoke with an agent who was extremely rude and she claimed she would call the supervisor. After wasting our time and holding us up she comes back repeating herself and explaining how the supervisor can not come speak with us. A supervisor who shows no effort to speak with customers what kind of service are we paying for people? This agent was extremely rude shouting at us and continuously walking away as we were speaking. I would not recommend this airline to anyone and I personally will never contribute any of my money to their stupid airline.,-1
2021-01-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Washington,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Still as horrible as you’ve always been,False,"  This review is for an upcoming trip that was booked and had to be cancelled. This trip was to include my senior aged mother and toddler child and was to visit an immediate family member who has failing health. It was determined due to COVID that it was safer for them to stay home. I attempted to get a refund for the tickets from United Airlines but they seem to be so hard up they refused, despite my explanation of concerns. It would also be nice to have the cash back in my pocket during these troubled times. Thanks United. Still as horrible as you’ve always been. Maybe if I had said the word funeral you would’ve grown a temporary heart.",-1
2021-01-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Sacramento,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Horrible customer service,True, Absolutely the worst airline I've ever flown with. Horrible customer service. I called 48 hours ahead to put my service dog on my flight and got there to the airport and it wasn't on. Service dog is a medical assist and ended up not being able to catch my flight. Absolutely rude customer service.,-1
2021-01-06,1.0,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Sydney via Los Angeles,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,3.0,3,I’m grateful they are still running,True," I flew from Canada to Australia via Chicago and LA. Our checked luggage made the very tight connection at ORD which was impressive. The LAX-SYD leg of the trip was outstanding and United deserve credit for continuing to run this journey despite only being allowed very limited passengers. Staff were attentive, our last-minute dietary requests were able to be accommodated, we were bumped up to Economy Plus, the flight was on time, and we were kept informed about Australian entry requirements for Covid. Overall it was an amazing experience, one of the best international flights I’ve been on. It obviously helps to only have 30 passengers on a whole Boeing Dreamliner, but even above that everything went smoothly and the customer service was great. For Australians trying to get home from North America during the Covid pandemic this is a great option and I’m grateful they are still running.",1
2021-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington DC to Greensboro, NC",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst flight ever,True," Worst flight ever. To start, I had to check my carry on bag, while others were allowed to keep theirs. This started the trip off poorly. But nothing huge. Then the take off got delayed 45 minutes because apparently getting baggage to the proper place on time isn't possible for these guys. Just to clarify, that's 45 minutes late to take off for what was supposed to be an hour long Flight to Greensboro. A one hour flight. A one hour flight. Yes, I'm intentionally referencing Gilligan's Island, because that's the level of competence I have seen from United. None. Then after leaving almost later than the arrival time, we circle Greensboro for 30 minutes before going to Charlotte, because of some fog. But the staff refused to tell us much of anything until we were basically landing in Charlotte. Had I realized United's pilots cannot navigate fog (which is low lying clouds) I never would have agreed to fly with them. Much less paying to do so. So now, because of the incompetence of their staff, my terminally ill father (the reason for my trip) has to pick me up in Charlotte.",-1
2020-12-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Houston,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,United has not provided any support,True," I recently contracted COVID-19 and now need to change my flight scheduled on 01/1 to San Jose, Costa Rica. Other than waiving change fees, United has not provided any support so I can change my flight without paying more than +$80 in the price difference. The worst part is that they've waived this in the past and now that I literally cannot fly because of a medical emergency they cannot make do this for whatever reason. I was on the phone for over 1hr and 30 minutes and neither the agent nor supervisor was able to give me an option so I don't have to pay such a hefty amount. Terrible customer service and consideration to those that have been infected.",-1
2020-12-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Honolulu,5.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,3,personnel had no idea where to direct me,True," I'm a frequent business and pleasure flyer and flying United was the worst air travel experience I ever had. I bought a business-class flat bed ticket on United 363 from Newark to Honolulu leaving on 12/17/2020 at 9:50am. I required a business class level of service due to my injured spine with multiple herniated discs. Due to the snowstorm on the night of 12/16-12/17, I had difficulty finding a taxi and getting to the airport, and I arrived at the airport 50 minutes prior to my 9:40am departure. I had already checked in to my flight online and just needed to drop off 1 bag, which is technically still within United's 45-minute window submitting luggage for domestic flights. However, when I inquired about business class service, United personnel had no idea where to direct me. At first they sent me from the 2nd to the 3rd level of Newark Terminal C, however the United personnel there claimed they don't service Hawaii and sent me back down to Level 2, which was all Economy and big lines. I tried approaching multiple United personnel and all of them refused to help me and directed me towards Economy lines. Soon, they claimed I was too late for my flight - but I wouldn't be late if they did their job from the beginning and assisted me with priority service! At this point I was sent to wait in a massive line for customer assistance (again, no business class service to be found). I would have missed every other UA flight waiting in that line, but I also called United customer service by phone, where United phone agent (the only helpful agent in this entire experience) helped me rebook for a flight that departed one hour later, at 10:50am with a connection in SFO. However, I was made to pay a $539 flight upgrade fee that was sold to me as an ""upgrade"" from business to 1st class, which in reality turned out to be exactly the opposite, a downgrade: an old upright seat with minimal recline that is vastly inferior to my previously booked flat bed business seat, and much worse for my back. I found this deeply unfair. Even after rebooking, checking in to my new First Class flight was again a nightmare and I almost missed it, too, with no one willing to assist me even as I followed the phone agent's advice and told United personnel that I was flying 1st class. Probably 5 or 6 employees shooed me away and told me to get into a line for Economy electronic kiosks (half of which weren't working) and a long Economy passenger line for bag drop-off. The computer kiosk (when I finally got to it) again claimed I was too late to register baggage for my newly re-booked flight, but I miraculously found one competent UA agent who helped me overcome this. All in all, I had an absolute worst nightmare flying experience of my life. The physical pain in my back flared up from all of the dashing between floors, kiosks, and lines that I was made to endure with no one able or willing to help me. The service I received from United was absolutely abominable and especially so for business/1st class, and frankly it was horrible for any human being in any class to be subjected to such humiliation, physical pain, and monetary deprivation (which was unreasonable because I was actually downgraded, not upgraded). Online complaint with UA resulted in a generic ""you were late and we won't do anything"" answer (arriving 50 minutes should have absolutely been accommodated for a business class traveler who already checked in). I will never fly United again.",-1
2020-12-29,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Athens,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Ridiculous policy and extremely frustrating,False,  United's policy requiring a kids over 2 to travel with a mask is impossible. Do the geniuses that work there have no kids. Try get an energetic 2 year old to wear a mask for 10 hours from here to Europe. Other airlines based outside the US are for more lenient and allow kids up to the age of 6 or so to not wear masks. Ridiculous policy and extremely frustrating. Get a grip United!,-1
2020-12-28,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,How unprofessional!,False,"  Worst airline ever! It ruined our holiday trip.

All because they couldn’t find a flight attendant. How unprofessional! Never fly United.",-1
2020-12-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Dubai via Frankfurt,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,This is highly unprofessional and ridiculous,False,"  I had booked a flight from SFO to Dubai return via Frankfurt. I completed my first leg of the trip, but on my second leg I was not allowed to board the flight from Dubai. Apparently due to some Covid restrictions in Europe and me being a certain visa holder. This is absolutely bizarre, first of all you don't inform the passenger. I had to reach the airport and only find out at the check in counter. I had to book another flight out of Dubai direct to the US which cost me close to $7000 because it was last minute. I have been put through mental harassment and it took me close to 48 hours to arrive back because of all this nonsense. I do not want credit for United because I am never flying United again. I need a refund of my money! This is highly unprofessional and ridiculous you put your passengers through this, the least we expect is some sort of a notification in order to plan ahead. I also chatted with an agent to cross check about any Covid related test etc and I was told I'm fine.",-1

They do not even allow you to have a simple conversation and act like you are a disturbance from just talking to someone. Makes me never want to fly with United again.,-1
2020-12-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Phoenix,,,,,,,1,why don’t you tell people the truth,True,"  My flights were originally booked for March of 2020 for a cruise. The cruise lines cancelled and airlines stopped briefly due to #Covid. Had I asked for a full refund back then, I would have received it. I wanted to support the travel industry hit hard by the pandemic and so I let United push my flights to December for a future trip. I call again and was told there was no refund but yet I could reroute flights and make it all work, including first class for my family and I on the way home for only $422 more. Now I’m $2447.80 into these flights for a family of four to go direct from Chicago to Phoenix and back. I even paid additional $146 four days ago to put us seated together.  I call to talk to someone about a fare difference I was notified on and I’m told there is no refund of fare difference or future fare credit due to my already exchanging the ticket once. If you’re going to promote “IT’S FREE TO CHANGE” then why don’t you tell people the truth, that any monies paid are NON-REFUNDABLE and we really don’t care about our customers because our agents are trained to say no no matter what a customer says to them. I went and tried to book these same flights to Phoenix from Chicago on American Airlines and coach is only $552! First class both ways is only $87 more than I am currently paying United and I only have first class one way on United. Yet United can keep my extra money with a smirk on their face. Southwest Airlines does it right. I was notified of a fare difference, I go on the website, I make the change and get $146 fare difference refund for future travel within 5 minutes. With United you have to call, get put on hold for an hour and a half, get transferred somehow to Mileage Plus, they profusely apologize and transfer me back, get an incompetent agent who can’t even give his supervisor both pnr records even though that’s what he said he spent a half hour doing, and then have a supervisor come on and still tell a customer no.",-1
2020-12-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Newark via Washington,,,,,,,1,They are unwilling to compromise,False,"  This airline has no loyalty towards customers or any consideration for customers. They are unwilling to compromise during emergency cancellations and will not refund or even a partial refund even though I had proof of Jury Duty. They state that refunds can be given based on the type of ticket, but after dealing with United I realised that they do their extreme best to not give that money back. They don’t care whether you missed your flight or not, they don’t care if it was unintentional or intentional. I spent 40 mins in the airport just trying to re book. It took me longer to re book a ticket than to walk through customs.",-1
2020-12-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Kansas City to Sacramento,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I have been going rounds with people at United,False,"  Where do I start. The first flight on 10 Oct 2020 - we went from Sacramento to Kansas City. (Layover in Denver). Mechanical issues in Sacramento and missed our flight in Denver and had to wait for 6 hours to get on the last flight out. ALL Flights full and every seat being used in the pandemic. 12 Oct 2020 - Kansas City to Sacramento (layover in Denver). Well, they took my carry-on bag in Kansas City and (that is lost and still can't find it). Then because of wind made us detour and in Colorado Springs and missed out flight in Denver to get home to Sacramento that day. They told us they couldn't get us on a flight home that night and we ended up on a Delta flight (much better service. plane, seats, middle seat not being used during the pandemic). Had to fly through Utah to get home at almost midnight instead of 3:45pm in the afternoon. Still dealing with my baggage issue and United is making Delta pay for my baggage. They aren't paying me for all of what was in my bag because they don't cover expensive things. (it was my carry-on). I have been going rounds with people at United (customer service) is not helpful, rude, don't speak good English.",-1

Masks are a must, no medical condition applies. All of the flight attendants won’t leave you alone about your mask. I do not recommend flying with United or American Airlines they are teaming up to make masks a must or you cannot fly.",-1
2020-12-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Buffalo,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1,100% dissatisfied and shocked,True," Literally the worst airline in the sky! Just came back from California, had a layover from Houston to Chicago then Buffalo. In Houston, departure was set for 2.20pm but didn't board until 2.30 due to a crew member running behind schedule. Then there was a lightening strike 15 mins after boarding, then they had to drop the cargo door and move luggage because of a weight proportioning issue. Finally we arrive to Chicago and our plane to Buffalo had already left. We go to customer service, soonest flight out is the next day. They say they won't compensate us for a hotel because the delay was due to weather, I said I needed a supervisor immediately. The supervisor finally comes over. I exclaim to him that had we departed when we were supposed to at 2.20 we would have never even had the lightening delay which was 35 min. Btw, he then spends a half hour on the phone only to say the exact same thing. I began to raise my voice in anger asking to speak to his supervisor in which he started to give me an attitude. I asked for a pen to write his name, he would only give me his first name, no last name. I stated that this was ridiculous that my wife and I had to pay for a hotel and do not have clothes transportation or toothbrushes and you're not even going to help, he said ""and I'll take my pen back too"" at that point I snapped began yelling. He then said now you're not getting home at all, canceled my return flight to Buffalo for the next day and said ""well looks like your refund comes out to about 30 dollars"". He would not reverse what he did even after I apologized for getting upset despite the situation. It later cost 300 for tickets home the next day, 185 for hotel, 55 for uber, and more than anyone should ever have to deal with. 1800# was absolutely no help. 100% dissatisfied and shocked with how terrible they handled my situation. I felt literally helpless and could not find any direction in the company to turn to.",-1
2020-11-26,0.1,Business,Business Class,Salt Lake City to Sydney via Los Angeles,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,worst check-in experience I've ever had,True,"  United at Salt Lake City Intl. delivers absolutely the worst check-in experience I've ever had. Staff were unhelpful, condescending and, in one case, just plain rude. One would believe they've never seen a traveller with an international connection before, at all. Certainly no ""service"" delivered at all. If its possible, the additional inconvenience and hassle could be described as ""Anti-service"". I did express my dissatisfaction to a person who was identified to me as the supervisor and I really don't think she cared in any way. Poor, poor show, United.",-1
2020-11-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tucson to Springfield,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,a horrible experience,False,  My daughter got on the plane. Then they stated they found a crack in the window and would all have to get off the plane. After her going to the ticket counter as she had a connecting flight they told her to go to Southwest Airlines and a new ticket if she wanted to go there. That was rude. Finally they said they are getting a new plane that just got out of the maintenance. They loaded. They landed and she got to her connecting flight where they attempted to take off and the check engine lights come on. They turned around and they had to get off. They again had to go search for a new plane. It was a horrible experience for a girl who flew by herself for the first time.,-1
2020-11-23,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Portland,1.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,They are not enforcing masks,True,  I am appalled at United’s decision to have the plane at full capacity during this pandemic. Cases are rising astronomically in the US. They are not enforcing masks and man sat coughing in the seat in front of me the whole flight with his mask down below his nose and they did nothing. This company really cares only about the money it makes and not about its employees or it’s passengers. I have been a United card holder and member for years. I will be switching airlines moving forward. The staff was nice which was their only saving grace this flight.,-1
2020-11-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Boise,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst customer service experience,True,"  Worst customer service experience of my life. I bought a round trip ticket, wound up driving the first half instead, after contacting United first to cancel my first flight, at which point they said I’d be good to go. When I rolled up to the airport to fly home on the second half of my round trip, and they told me they’d cancelled my ticket since I hadn’t flown the first leg, and wouldn’t accommodate me in any way. I told them that I had in fact cancelled my first flight, but they weren’t willing to budge.  They offered to sell me new tickets for the flights I’d already paid to be on (at a high price of course), indicating that the flight wasn’t even full, so it wouldn’t cost them anything to let me fly on the ticket I’d already paid for. I’ve heard bad things about United, and not had great experiences flying with them previously, but I was surprised at how blatant they are about their not caring about their customers whatsoever. Your loss United, I’ll make sure to book with anyone else going forward.",-1
2020-11-16,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Phoenix,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,a flight attendant that was so rude to my family and I,True, I love United Airlines and have flown it as my go to and will continue to. However this review is based off of a flight attendant that was so rude to my family and I. My wife and my 2 year old and 4 month old boys were catching a flight after our layover in Denver and the flight attendant looks us in the eyes and skips us while passing out drinks. Continually brushing my arm walking by with a trash bag not serving us at all. She also was very rude with her mannerisms and tone toward us. I’m opposed to being a Karen but to be blatantly disregarded on a flight was not okay. It is hard enough traveling with 2 little ones let alone having to bug the attendant to be served like everyone else around us. The other two flight attendants got us our drinks right away and also two wings for my boys and that is the amazing service of United that I know. We flew from Philadelphia to Denver and did not expect to end our trip in such a manner.,1

I had been planning this flight for months and my reason to fly for the first time in 16 years is now no longer a possibility, I’m a single mom with 3 kids and now I’m just out that money, it’s adding constant salt to an already deep wound.

2020-11-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Portland via Chicago,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they packed the flight completely,True,"  Since the pandemic began I have flown three times on three different airlines, the first two, SW. and Alaska Airlines social distanced us on the plane and made sure that if you were traveling alone there would be no one sitting next to you and did not pack the flight full for this reason. I flew on United airlines in November 2020, and they packed the flight completely full and crammed us all in like rats, and then used the Covid excuse when it was convenient for them, for example, “no you cannot sit in the exit row because of COVID-19“, and then they made a bunch of announcements about us needing to social distance, yet they did not do their part to make that happen. On my flight home, another packed flight, there was a guy across from us who was obviously drunk and kept throwing his mask on the ground refusing to wear it, none of the flight attendants noticed and I had to point it out to them, not to mention the fact that while he was unmasked he was coughing without covering his mouth, all they did was ask him to put his mask on a couple of times, but is soon as they would walk away he would take it off and look at us and smirk. When I asked the flight attendant why they booked the flight full and weren’t social distancing us,(I mentioned to him that other airlines didn’t pack the flight full), his response was, “Well southwest social distances on the plane for political reasons, but if you’re not comfortable you can get off the plane and book another flight”. So was he saying the pandemic is political and not real? I will never fly United airlines again, especially during an international pandemic.",-1
2020-11-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to New York,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I would rather just travel American,False,"  I was trying to book my flight from CLE to LGA for December 2020. The price on Google flights was different from the one posted on the website, this is not the issue. The issue is when I called the company to inquire about the error I was receiving on the website while trying to buy the ticket. The customer service representative I spoke to was extremely rude, constantly talking over me, not even trying to figure out how we could fix the problem of the price discrepancy. He kept saying the call was cutting out, which is not true because I could hear him just fine, he just kept repeating the same things and not hearing me out or trying to help me with my issue. If they are offering the same price as American Airlines, or even if it is cheaper, I would rather just travel American. I will at least be treated with respect and will get my money's worth. The disrespect was just beyond me, I respect customer service representatives, but this man was just plain old disrespectful.",-1

They then transferred me to a different flight which leaves tonight to São Paulo. However, the connection to Rio is through LATAM. I paid for a 12h flight and it's actually going to be days of travel. They cannot guarantee I'll be able to take my emotional support animal with me from São Paulo to Rio since it's a different airline. Last night a customer service rep from United walked out on us (I have that on video). After all of this, I've gotten nothing to make up for all these facts. I've had huge anxiety attacks since then, my husband's mother is in the hospital and United hasn't shown any interest in helping us.",-1
2020-11-07,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Jose to Tampa via Houston,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,,4.0,5,I was pleasantly surprised,True,"  Despite the fact that Hurricane Eta delayed our flight to Houston by more than four hours, the experience was reasonably positive. The load factor was quite low - about 40 passengers, which meant that even Gold Elites got upgraded. The plane was clean and neat, and the cabin crew was friendly, efficient, and pleasant. The food and beverages were disappointing, but in the age of Covid-19, most airlines have restricted the time that passengers can eat and drink with their masks removed. Check-in was immediate, particularly since I didn't know about the delay and thus showed up at 06:30 for a 12:45 flight, Immigration in Houston was empty, and my suitcase was delivered quickly. The connecting flight to Tampa was somewhat more crowded, but both emergency exit rows were unoccupied. Hence my seat at 20A was both comfortable and socially distanced. The United Club in Terminal E is now open. The food offerings were minimal, but the bar service has returned to pre-pandemic level. This was my first air trip in almost twelve months. Given the avalanche of negative reviews on Skytrax, I was pleasantly surprised with how well the experience turned out.",1
2020-11-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Los Angeles,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3,"Biggest complaint, not enforcing rules",False,"  Not good at social distancing. Packed 3 people across in my row when there were obvious several unoccupied seats seen with only one person in that row. Biggest complaint, not enforcing rules. I observed 3 people with laptops and pads out from sitting for departure til arrival at LAX gate. Never once stowed them away and not once being asked to do so. Lady in back of me talked on phone from gate, down runway and halfway up into the air. It surprised me on how many people think rules do not apply to them but more so was how the steward did not do her job. She simply did not care. She could have had a little nicer attitude overall. She acted like her job was a bother to her. But that being said, the voice of the lady on the overhead speaker (up front cabin) was very pleasant and upbeat and plane was clean. Will reconsider when booking my next flight.",-1
2020-11-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Paris via Newark,,,,,,1.0,1,will never get my business again,False,"  Despite having corresponded with the French Embassy in New Orleans prior to my flight to assure I had all the proper documents to fly during the pandemic this staff at the gate of the second leg of my trip refused to let me on the plane on the basis of ""that's not a reason to go to France"". I was going to meet my wife in Paris who just got her visa for the US and she was flying in from South Africa. I had two one way tickets, one going was United, return was Delta. I was to meet her in the international terminal then get on the plane back to the states with her. Now she has to navigate international travel by herself and I was left stranded in New Jersey because the gate people wouldn't even look at the email I had from the french embassy stating that all I needed to do was fill out the International Travel Doc to mainland France. They kept telling me I needed a COVID test, I said I don't need it, it states here in the email that I don't need it for just traveling through the airport. But I also informed them I have a test anyway but they still refused to look at it or reason with me telling me I need to prove my relationship with my wife. They refused to look at any if the paperwork I had including all my flight itineraries after I told them I was just meeting my wife in the airport and flying back on the basis of ""that's not a reason to go to Paris"". United Airlines will never get my business again as their staff are the most incompetent of any airline I have ever flown on.",-1
2020-11-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Philadelphia,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,Ridiculous service,True,"  My flight to Philadelphia was a decent flight nothing special about it for the money that I spent. On my flight home to Houston, I spent another 200 dollars extra for my dog Lucy to come back home with me. While she was barking during the flight the flight attendant told me to shut her up when she would only be quiet if I took her out of her bag. The flight attendants were rude. When i told him she would only be quiet if she was out of the bag he said “i will have to note this down and she won’t be able to fly with you anymore” I spent over 500 dollars on that flight and all they cared about was other customers complaining. Ridiculous service and I will not be flying or giving my money to United ever again. That was the only company I enjoyed flying with until this incident.",-1
2020-10-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to New Orleans via Denver,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,the staff could have treated me much nicer,True," First time flying with this airline and I am not happy. I’m sitting in Denver airport, 48 hrs into my trip at this point exhausted and upset. I get that we can’t control hurricanes, but the staff could have treated me much nicer during this. I’ve had my flight pushed back twice and I have asked about accommodations or anything really to help me out and was not only not helped, I was talked down to laughed at and dismissed. I would not recommend this airline to anyone with anxiety around flying because they’re thoroughly unwilling to be helpful or even respectful.",-1
2020-10-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Dallas Ft Worth,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,harrowing prior encounter with this airline,True,"  This was an attempt at forgetting the harrowing prior encounter with this airline. I only got to them because they were to provide the last leg on my trip out of Africa. After sending me bouncing between them and the issuer of the ticket, they resolved at 10:00 that it was too late to put me on a flight that I was already ticketed for and had a boarding pass issued by their partner airline. The flight was not scheduled to leave till 10:40! I was told to WAIT and TAKE a chance at the next flight scheduled for around 6:00pm.",-1
2020-10-23,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Charleston,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,a great travel experience,True,  Just want to give a shout out to all at United Airlines. Thank you for making travel comfortable during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Boarding Process was seamless and the Flight Attendants provide great service and are friendly. Thank you for a great travel experience.,1
2020-10-23,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Newark,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5,I wasn’t disappointed,True,"  This was my first time flying United in over 13 years and I wasn’t disappointed. The ticket I purchased was super cheap, checking in was a breeze due to the fact that many people aren’t flying at the moment. Since the flight was a red eye, by the time I got to LAX all food places were closed except for a little store selling sandwiches and chips. On the aircraft all passengers on main cabin were provided with a ziploc bag filled with a cookie, some chips and a bottle of water and afterwards the crew came by with sodas, coffee and juice. Movie selection on this flight was amazing, since the airplane was equipped with seat back TVs there were well over 100 movies and shows to chose from and headphones were complimentary. The only thing is due to the pandemic there was no food for sale onboard but at least they had free sodas",1
2020-10-22,0.3,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,"Phoenix, AZ to Cancun, Mexico",4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2,Flight attendant was very rude,False,"  First the airlines switched the our transfer point. It was Phoenix to Houston, then switched to Los Angeles, then 2 hours before departing switched to Denver, Co. Secondly for an International flight they did not serve or have any items for purchase for lunch. Could not also buy alcohol if we wanted. Flight attendant was very rude when we asked. On Alaska and Delta if you upgrade to seats with more leg room you are offered complimentary beer or wine. I would even have paid for my alcohol if given the choice in flight. Will never fly this airline again, unorganized, stingy and not fully prepared. Also when we arrive 3 hours early as instructed for international flight, no customer service agents were there to have our bags checked.",-1
2020-10-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Miami,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,certainly will never fly it again,False,"  I was sold in economy ticket, and this comes with no overhead storage no checked luggage only under seat storage, but this was not made clear at the time of ticketing. The processes in adequately described, it was not even enforced in the first trip I took, and results in the cost of the flight essentially increasing by 50%. Had this pricing policy been made to me prior to purchasing tickets, I would not have flown this airline at all. I certainly will never fly it again. One cannot travel at all without clothing",-1
2020-10-19,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Charlotte,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4,"staff were courteous, caring and professional",True," We flew from Salt Lake City to Charlotte and then back again a week later in October with United Airlines. United Airlines, I feel, did an outstanding job of with customer service and the level of comfort we felt on the airplanes. The seats were comfortable and with two of our flights we were able to upgrade to economy plus for a reasonable price which made the seats even better. The staff were courteous, caring and professional. Even though our return flight was delayed because of mechanical issues they kept us informed of what was going on. After a forty five minute delay we were told if we missed our connecting flight there was a backup plan for all of us. Fortunately we were able to make our connecting flight due to our arrival and departure gates being close together. When we had gotten settled on our connection flight my husband realized he had left his cell phone on our first flight. Just as I was about to ask a flight attendant what our options were another flight attendant appeared who was out of breathe. She had run from gate to gate to personally return his cell phone to us which saved us the headache of trying to figure out if we could get the phone back or if we had to purchase a new phone. Thank you United Airlines for a good traveling experience! Thank you for all you do. I know that the planes were not socially distanced because all of our flights were full but I realize what the airlines are going through and the stress they must feel. At no point did we feel unsafe and the staff did the best they could and if they were feeling stressed they did not show it and were very professional and caring.",1
2020-10-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,First Class,Orlando to Los Angeles,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5,told me I needed to put my mask on,True,"  My finance and I Flew first class with united as we always do. Upon arrival everything was Fine. I opened my sandwich after the no seat belt signed was lit up. He immediately came over and (he wouldn’t give me his name) and told me I needed to put my mask on! I explained I was eating my dinner and have a drink he told me it doesn’t matter it’s behind that Point and he cares for a cancer patient I need it in at all times. Regardless to say I am 7 weeks pregnant and get sick if I don’t eat, I took my mask off to eat my sandwich and drink my water and was harassed on a united flight to LA. I fly United regularly and am a gold member the way I was treated today on a united flight makes me question ever flying again. The only time during the duration of flight my mask was Off is while I was eating. I explained my self clearly To the flight attendants and he refused to give me his name, he told me someone will be waiting for me when I get off the plane to discuss my issue. I asked another flight attendant as well as she refused to give me his name. We fly United Atleast once a month regularly and have never been treated so disgusting and poorly!",-1
2020-10-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Seattle,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,It’s terribly unprofessional,True, The flight time had been postponed right before my flight with no notification/call/message or email. Are you in your mind to change the time right when I am on my way to the airport? The is my first and last time using this airline - United Airlines. It’s terribly unprofessional.,-1
2020-10-10,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Columbus via Chicago,1.0,,2.0,,,3.0,3,plane was packed and again no social distancing,False,"  I recently flew with United Airlines from Toronto to Chicago to Columbus Ohio and a return flight from Columbus to Washington to Toronto. I was not impressed with my flights due to the fact that they do not worry about social distancing. When I booked my flights, I specifically asked how many were on the flights and if I would have a seat to myself, in which the answer was yes. My flight from Toronto to Chicago, I had someone sitting next to me, even though there were empty seats available. They give you a tiny little wet wipe that you would use in a restaurant to wipe down your seat, which is useless. There was a family with 3 adults and two children on the flight that kept getting up out of their seats, chasing their kid who was going up and down the aisle and their one child who was about 5 years old was supposed to be wearing a mask and he wasn't. My return flight home was even worse. The plane was packed and again no social distancing. Even though the flight attendant announced 3 times for people to wear their mask during the whole flight, a gentleman sitting in the seat across from me, had no mask on the entire flight. Are these flight attendants scared to say something to people? Very disappointed as it seems United Airlines is concerned only about the money they are making and not the safety of the people on board. Made my travel experience and my anxiety levels horrible during this pandemic.",-1
2020-10-09,0.2,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Hartford to Durango,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,I was totally taken advantage of,False,"  We paid an additional $90.00 for our flight so we wouldn’t have to check a bag. First leg was fine, second leg, we were told we had to check the bag, but it would be at the end of the ramp when we landed. When we did land, they switched again and made us wait for baggage claim. I was totally taken advantage of, both by United and the staff.",-1
2020-10-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Duluth to Chicago,,,,,,1.0,1,Terribly disappointed,True,"  United Airlines is a terrible airline. I had booked my flight to depart from Duluth at 3:20 p.m. The day before, when I go to check in, I find out that my flight has been rescheduled 4 hours earlier. I call customer service and no agent is available. I ended up needing to wait 5 hours in the airport for a connecting flight. There was no refund, no explanation and no apology. Terribly disappointed.",-1
2020-10-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas via Washington DC,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"This is a pandemic, what is wrong with you guys",True," Full flight all middle seats were sold and taken. I just flew on Jetblue and I thought that was a step down from Delta, how on earth did I get to this! I thought United was big and had standards, obviously not not for my health or comfort as a customer or its employees. This is a pandemic, what is wrong with you guys!",-1
2020-09-26,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Orlando,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,my first time ever flying United and I’m thinking our last,False,"  First, my husband and I had our travels canceled to New York because of Covid. We rescheduled and added our kids. When I called the airlines for a code to use instead of a refund, to choose a different date and add our kids to the vacation, she said no, she has to do it, I couldn’t do it myself. Then rescheduling, and using the money we had already purchased for New York, when the lady told me the total, it was literally like buying 5 new tickets. Then just before our flight this month I called to ask about seating. The lady told me I had to pay for seating no matter what. I said: so I pay a ton of money to fly, then you are going to charge me to sit? I don’t need assigned seating, she told me I did, she lied to me. Then coming home to Las Vegas, the maintenance did not take care of the aircraft as they needed. We ended up then having to all get off the plane and later getting on another one. Then not only having a layover in Denver, but then had to fly to San Francisco and then to Las Vegas. I fly at least once a year, this was my first time ever flying United and I’m thinking our last. Also, you have to pay for luggage both ways? What? Every other flight I have taken, obviously it’s a round trip since that is what I book. I obviously want our luggage coming back with us, why would they not just have the charge for the destination and back? So much that is wrong and inconvenient with this airline. Only good thing about it, is some of the planes have a TV on them. But I would rather have a straight shot without all the lay overs. I even think Allegiant does a way better job than United.",-1
2020-09-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2,Would not recommend,False,"  Currently sitting on a completely booked flight. I am part of a family of 6. Instead of seating us 3 and 3 as the rows would allow, we were placed 2,2, and 2 leaving us sitting with a stranger in each row. There was clearly no thought process in this arrangement in an already suboptimal experience. We fly very frequently and had heard United was complying and doing more than their part to make sure the COVID era was as safe as possible. This was far from the case. Would not recommend. Delta is superior in all aspects.",-1
2020-09-25,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to London,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,one of them was so nasty and hateful,True,"  The staff was in general very nice to me and my little kids. But one of them was so nasty and hateful to me and my little kids who didn't cover their nose with their mask for each second... [which is not understandable in first place - why kids in the age of 3 and 4 years have to wear a mask] - what are they expecting from those little kids? they don't understand the need of wearing a mask, its so uncomfortable for them and they pulling it every few minutes. This nasty one was at my seat latterly every 2 minutes to scream on me why my kids are not covering their nose with their mask! I understand that we must take caution to keep us safe and healthy, but we need to do it normally. and what she did to me and my kids is totally unacceptable! I was on a night flight, and my kids tried to sleep, but with this mask on their face which is almost covering their eyes, it was impossible for them.",-1
2020-09-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Chicago,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,does not appear to care at all,True,"  United Airlines does not appear to care at all about it’s customers as people. One would think that during a pandemic when air travel is way down, they would do their best to provide a high level of service. Their best is apparently not very good. They can’t bring a flight in on time to save their lives. Why? Why is this inconvenience and frustration acceptable in this industry and no other. Rest assured, United Airlines will do nothing to ensure you arrive at your destination as advertised. Consider your arrival time as a very rough estimate that likely means you’ll get there on that calendar day but whenever it fits into their schedule. Terrible!",-1
2020-09-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Cabo,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Fly with them if you want to be mistreated,False,"  Our first business class experience with United made sure we won’t ever fly with them again. SFO to Cabo flight was delayed for 4 hours. Coming back we were seated away from each other amid our timely check in the day prior and a phone call we placed to confirm we will be seated next to each other. Throughout the SFO-Cabo flight, half the business class was wearing their masks and the crew did not care to remind. On the way back, their family separation tactic made sure more people can spread Covid. When we asked what was the reason of separating us after our confirmation, the come back was “I don’t think you are listening to me carefully. You have 2 choices, either talk to the gate agent or you can leave on another plane at another day”. Proven United Airlines have excellent code of ethics and employee training. Fly with them if you want to be mistreated, yelled at, or forced to sit next to a potential Covid carrier.",-1
2020-09-08,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Chicago to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,4 hrs being harassed by this woman,True,"  Had the rudest, aggressive and combative head flight attendant ever! I had just sat down for 15 secs when she started in on me. Apparently she had just been at it with my seat mate. 4 hrs of being harassed by this woman. It's one thing to be nice and friendly, it's another to be treated with an attitude that will not stop. I put the tray table down with my legs crossed, that was not Ok so I stopped. My legs were cramping so I stretched them out in front of me That was not OK, so I stopped, they told me it due to COVID. I asked ""Do you not disinfect the plane between flights, that's what the ad said?"" She started fumbling for words. Not the yes or no answer I was looking for, I asked for her name but the junior attendants did not want to give it to me, so I went and took their pictures. Right before landing, she comes by and stands right in front the exit row seats that have been blocked off (we were just behind that row) and starts spraying disinfectant. The over spray landed on our faces and hands. I was lucky to wear glasses but my seat mate got some in his eyes too. She did not say a single word, just started spraying. One would think that the flight attendant would say something like ""I need to be cautious and spray so an you please cover yourself."" I guess I got my answer as to whether United disinfects between flights if she's spraying, but on the ad it looks like professional grade, not just a household spray bottle. But that is not the end of it. I'm not sure what yarn was told but as we are getting ready to open the door and deplane, there were two officers and two United Reps waiting to escort me off the plane. I was fortunate to have a great seat mate who had also endures and witnessed the whole thing. I am very thankful and grateful that he did not hesitate to be my witness and give his accountant of the circumstances. It was really unbelievable! Just beyond the pail and this is the head main cabin flight attendant who is suppose to be at least neutral instead of having an axe to grind.",-1
2020-09-05,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to San Francisco via Oakland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,taking no precautions whatsoever for our safety,True," Flying United Airlines is dangerous and they don't care about your safety or health. They put profits over passengers. The flight I was on was 100% full, no empty middle seats, no social distancing whatsoever. Many of the passengers didn't even have on masks. I got off the flight because I was not going to put my health at risk for Covid. It was astounding and unconscionable that they would not fly at a lesser capacity to assure the safety of their customers. Clearly greed was more important than my life as a paying customer. I will never fly United again. I was forced to lose a day of work, to get rebooked on a less full flight but even then they said it was just the roll of the dice and if it filled up, tough luck. They were taking no precautions whatsoever for our safety and protection in terms of the crowded flights. They said they wiped the plane down but shouldn't they do that anyway? Don't they know that Covid is airborne. Shaking my head in disbelief and outrage. They didn't even offer a hotel voucher and refused when I asked. So I was asked to either spend more money, miss work and be inconvenienced or risk my life and health to fly on a small, packed plane with no social distancing and a serious lack of wearing masks because they are too greedy to schedule additional flights so they can fly with a less crowded plane. It ended costing me twice as much as the ticket I originally purchased to be safe. That was not my experience on Delta, Jet Blue or Southwest where the flights respected some social distancing and they were strict about mask wearing.",-1
2020-09-03,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2,pack the planes during the pandemic,True,"  I am a 1k, million miler and global services level 6 times with United. I am changing to Delta. United does not care about employeeS or customer safety. They only want to pack the planes during the pandemic. They fill every middle seat (including exits next to 1K). By contrast, Delta does not the Delta plane I flew 2 weeks ago appeared much cleaner also. I am switching loyalty after 20 yrs with United.",-1

2020-09-01,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Wichita,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,2,not having the staff to fly the plane,True,  They changed the gate many times thru the day and then delayed the flight due to United not having the staff to fly the plane. They had to call in people at the last minute. They delayed us and hour and a half and then when we got close to boarding they didn't know if they had pilots. When we actually got to load the plane we got everyone in the plane and then they made us all get out and move to another plane down the concourse. What was supposed to be a mild delay is now over 3 hours.,-1
2020-08-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,packed flight with no social distance,True,"  I will never fly United again. Delta was so good and kept everyone separated. United was a packed flight with no social distance at all. Strangers next to strangers, eating and drinking allowed. This company does not care about anyone even their employees who have to fly with all these people during a pandemic. The craziest part was when we were getting off the flight, then all of a sudden they care about social distance by only allowing five rows at a time. Like you didn’t care this whole time.",-1

2020-08-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Paris,,,,,,,1,never book another trip with them,False, I had a trip planned with my school to study abroad and because of COVID-19 that had to be canceled. I tried using my flight credits for a different flight and the lady I was one the phone with was extremely rude. I also had to pay extra money to use those flight credits within the United States where before I was going outside of the states. I ended up having to cancel that trip too (which I did within my 24 hour time frame) and have not received my full refund. I have tried contacting them multiple times stating that I haven't received the rest of my refund to which they say it was refund to a card that I don't own so I don't know where my money was sent to but I am very disappointed in this airline that they never tried to make things right. I will never book another trip with them again nor will I ever suggest them to anyone I know who is traveling.,-1

I was on a connecting flight from Denver to Boise and the passenger next to me removed her mask after the flight took off. Nothing was said to her by the attendant I did not say anything due to the fact that it would be a passenger that would throw a tantrum and I did not want to make a scene. Besides the fact it was the attendant’s job. It was a full flight no seats between passengers.,-1
2020-07-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,,,,,,,1,They are terrible,False,"  United Airlines is the worst to work with, when booking a flight, doing anything on their website and talking to them over the phone. I had two vouchers ($108 and $20) I am trying to book 2 flights as we speak. They took my voucher, subtracted it from the total and charged my card the rest of the amount but then never received a confirmation email, charge went through and now they won't let me have my tickets nor my vouchers back.

I try to refund my money but United Airlines prefer to give me the future credit which is useless for me because we do not know when the outbreak will end. Moreover, I need to pay more money to them if I use my future credit. It's ridiculous. However, I got my full money back from Korean Airline and Delta Airline. Even my ticket is non-refundable, they did the great job and did their responsibility fully.",-1

My flight was fantastic, the Crew were polite and welcoming. They frequently came around in case anyone wanted refreshments and when i fell asleep and missed meal time, i got given my meal as soon as I woke up. I was given a whole row to myself to ensure social distances measures were met. There were plenty of movies/tv shows to pick from and they also provided dietary specific meals, which I hadn’t had previously on other airlines. So if the crew is reading this, I’d like to give a huge thank you!",1

I was previously in a row with another unknown individual who was also concerned about his health. The FA approaches and told me to return to my seat. After questioning social distancing practices she told me that social distancing is no excuse to move seat and if I was worried about social distancing I wouldn’t be here. I don’t think you know everyone’s situation, and could probably use a little work on those people skills. I’m a regular United passenger and haven’t had similar experiences in the past. If you’re concerned with yours and others health and well being I’d say skip United all around after this experience.",-1
2020-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tampa,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,forced me to check my bag,True,"  I am a mileage plus member and had a family crisis forcing me to travel during a pandemic. Because it states that as long as you are a mileage plus member you can bring a bag regardless of your ticket type. I booked economy to save the money. Not only did the force me to pay for the bag because my husband booked it under his mileage plus account, but then forced me to check my bag. The flight was maybe 20% full. I begged to not check and was told “there is plenty of overhead room on the plane, but I had the wrong ticket”. Again I had my plus card with me. According to United disclaimer this is all I needed to carry on a bag. I have been a frequent flyer for years. United does not care, they let me pay them additional money and forced me to stop and pick up a bag.  Heartless. I paid even more money to upgrade so I wouldn’t have to do this on the way home. Never again",-1
2020-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to New Jersey,,,,,,1.0,1,Worst experience flying,True,  Worst experience flying I have ever had. Our flight was set to board at 8:00 according to our boarding passes. We arrived at the gate at 8:03. The plane had already been boarded and the flight crew closed the doors. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told it was my fault because it was 8:03 and boarding was 8:00. The United staff was rude and just kept saying sir you were late. How can a plane board close and push off in three minutes. Who teaches customers service where you tell the paying customer they are wrong and it’s their fault?not a single person wanted to help and even had any concern that our luggage would be ahead of us. This airline and it’s employees and policies are trash.,-1
2020-07-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jackson to Houston,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,2,never travel this airline again,True,"  8lbs overweight for 1 bag charged me 105 dollars. I didn't even have a carry on, I will make sure to never travel this airline again. I really love those charges you get right when you are at the counter, with basically no choice but to pay it. Thanks again.",-1
2020-07-13,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Prague to Phoenix via London,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,wish to thank United Airlines,False," I wish to thank United Airlines during the recent covid-19 pandemic. They were incredible. We had tickets on another airline we had bought using credit card points. When that airline's flights were cancelled due to recent regulations concerning entering the US at particular points of entry, and when the EU was on the verge of closing its borders, United stepped up and accepted the other airlines points and allowed us to fly with them instead. During a crises, this airline did not concern itself with only making money but doing the right thing to help stranded travelers. I cannot thank them enough for what they did to help us and no doubt countless others in similar predicaments. I will, from now on, only think in terms of this airline as being our savior.",1
2020-07-12,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Washington,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,actually pretty good,True,"  United Airlines was actually pretty good on this 9.5 hour flight, with a modern cabin and tons of entertainment selections. The food was all right, but they served way too little for such a long daytime flight. The flight being half empty also helped, and the Star Wars safety video slaps. ZRH airport is really nice, IAD not so much, but it is an American airport so no surprise there. Anyways, good flight United!",1
2020-07-03,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Houston,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,2,never fly United Airlines again,False, I am flying to Houston for a wedding. I have a luggage the size of a carry on & didn’t think anything of it when I bought my ticket. I did not know that with basic economy you don’t even get an option to bring a carry on. My flight was already changed to 12:30 from my initial 10am arrival flight but I had to take it because my sisters wedding dinner starts at 3!! I called & there isn’t even an option anymore to upgrade my flight because it’s full. But I’m sure the cabin space isn’t! I will be forced to pay $40 to & from Houston for a bag half full but I don’t want to ball my bridesmaids dress up in a backpack just to not pay the fees! How do completely strip a customers option to bring their luggage on the aircraft if there is room & capability to do so. I will never fly United Airlines again because of this reason alone,-1
2020-07-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to London,,,,,,,1,No offer of a full refund,False," We were scheduled to take a trip to Europe mid-May. Due to COVID travel bans, we called to inquire on the flight status and were told that the flight was still scheduled. However after giving the customer service representative our confirmation number and ticket numbers, we were told we were not on the flight list and soon learned that our account had been hacked, our flights were cancelled, the hacker was issued a voucher, and then booked a flight to Cancun. We requested a full refund (which was not immediately offered). This necessitated countless follow up emails and phone calls over the past two months, which United ultimately denied. They issued us vouchers (minus the trip insurance). No offer of a full refund, no apology for the security breach.",-1
2020-06-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Prague,,,,,,,1,get the refund from the travel agency,False,  Eight of us booked flight to Prague in March from New York to Prague and cancelled the flight due to COVID-19. United Airline refused to refund our three hundred dollars as cancellation fee. We appealed the top management to review our case since March but they kept on asking us to get the refund from the travel agency despite the travel agency told us the cancellation fees were with United Airlines. Customer satisfaction is only a slogan to United. It's a pity that United Airlines never learned the lessons from all the scandals related to customer service in the past years and never intend to rebuild its reputation.,-1
2020-06-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,Houston to London,,,,,,,1,customer service is bad,False,"  United is the worst airline you will ever experience. Their customer service is bad, treatment is bad, every thing is bad.They took 2 months to respond on my refund request of 5000$ tickets for flights that they cancelled based on the COVID 19 lockdown, and instead of refunding the money, they offered travel vouchers, as if we will use this unprofessional airline again in future. Think twice, they don’t care about you, they care about your money indeed.",-1
2020-06-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Portland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,should be ashamed of their behavior,True,"  I had an extremely horrific experience with United Airlines and Dollar UA in December 2019. The booking process went smoothly. The flight was a typical United flight - uncomfortable on an airplane the belonged in 1986. The issue came when I went to the rental car counter - I showed them my reservation and they did not have it. They claimed that I booked my reservation for the non-airport location. I had to bring up my email confirmation that proved otherwise. This caused a stir at the counter as they weren’t sure they would have a car for me. Mind you, it was about 8PM at night, and I had a 2-hour car ride to look forward to. Coupled with the aforementioned terrible flight, I wasn’t in the mood to be told there was no car availability when I had a reservation. I was able to get a car, but I had to pay extra due to the reservation “mixup” (if you can call it that). I filed a complaint with United Airlines and Dollar UA. United and Dollar UA accused me of changing my reservation to the non-airport car rental location, despite my email confirmation as proof that I did no such thing and chose the airport location to begin with. Both companies ignored several follow-ups and pleas to look at my case. In fact, at one point, they were pointing fingers at each other, trying to send me running in circles. I even emailed the CEO and COO of United and of course, heard crickets. The extreme amount of disrespect, disregard for human nature, and overall extremely poor customer service sickened me. I escalated matters to BBB. BBB did not resolve my case. BBB ignored my email confirmation that I booked for the airport pick-up location and sided with Dollar and United. It was extremely frustrating that I was being ignored for booking a car online and choosing the location that I intended. I did everything right in my reservation process. United and Dollar were both at fault and it was obvious they simply do not care about their customer. They stole from me, and then tried to make me look like the bad guy for their egregious and obvious error. Their lack of accountability and sheer unprofessional behavior drove me to continue pushing the matter. My initial escalation in this matter started at the beginning of January 2020. It is mid-June and it is just being resolved now. It has taken 2 months of escalations to come to a resolution, after me getting nowhere by myself for 4 months. It is a long saga that I am happy is now over. Will I ever fly United again, or book with Dollar UA? Absolutely not, and as a consumer reading this, I hope you don’t either. Their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service (while they operate in a customer service industry) is simply shocking. I have no more words to describe the unsightly behavior I witnessed by United and Dollar UA representatives. They should be ashamed of their behavior and I hope one day they can learn a hard lesson that devaluing and manipulating the customer is not an okay option.",-1
2020-06-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to New York via Los Angeles,,,,,,,1,refuses to refund my rescheduling fee,False,"  I booked a flight for my daughter from Amsterdam to Los Angeles with a lay-over in Washington. United Airlines changed her flight where she had a 4 hour lay-over in New York. I was concerned about this given the COVID-19 situation there, so I rescheduled her flight to go through Frankfurt and paid an 85 dollar rescheduling fee. Now United rescheduled her flight again and she is back on the same flight as before with the 4 hour lay-over in New York, but United refuses to refund my rescheduling fee. How is that fair?",-1

They do not offer any assistance due to weather conditions. My layover in Houston was cancelled due to tornados in the area and UA went to San Antonio airport instead. I had to switch to a different flight for the morning and pay out of pocket for a hotel and food with zero assistance from the airline. My flight in the morning was also delayed an hour but they don’t care. The fact that they can treat a person like this is insane. Airlines are in the customer service industry and United has the worst customer service. Don’t bother,-1
2020-05-15,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Durango,5.0,,5.0,,3.0,1.0,1,I cannot accept this rudeness,True,  I asked the United agent working the desk at the gate for a boarding pass. She was rude and demanded to know where my boarding pass was and then ridiculed me for not having it. I stepped aside and said I cannot accept this rudeness. I walked down to another United gate and was treated respectfully by the agent and received my boarding pass. Why does united retain these kind of people?,-1

2020-05-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas  to Albany  via Chicago,,,,,,,1,I could only get a voucher,True,"  I planned a family vacation at the end of June and early July, back on January 1st. I am flying to San Diego with Delta, to Flagg Staff through American and home from Las Vegas on United. Unfortunately, with the corona virus, we are unable to go. Delta, American, Greyhound, Holiday Inn, Hilton, and Alamo all refunded me in full and wished me luck in getting a chance to go on this trip in the future. United however, would not refund my $2000 because they said I had bought ""non refundable"" tickets and I could only get a voucher to fly in the next 24 months. Every other company understood that these are bad times and refunded me ""non refundable"" money. Wake up United!! These are difficult times. Vouchers for a future flight does not pay my mortgage or feed my kids.",-1
2020-05-11,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Newark,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,on time and very comfortable,False,"  European carrier left us stranded in Paris two days after the US issued the travel ban. Couldn’t get any answers from that airline in any way. US embassy in Paris was closed (thanks for nothing). Got a flight for the next morning on United within 2 hours, without being gouged. Flight was on time, and very comfortable in a Boeing 787. Thank you United-this seemed like a lifeline during a difficult and stressful experience.",1
2020-05-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles via Washington,,,,,,,1,I want my money back,True,"  Due to fly to USA but due to Covid-19 flight cancelled. I’ve asked for a full refund which according to Department Of Transport I’m entitled to a full refund but all they keep offering is vouchers. These are no good to us as we have ongoing medical problems so chances of us now going to USA are near zero even though advised them of this still only offer voucher. This is their latest email: Dear Mark Harrison: Thank you for sharing your concerns about COVID-19. We certainly understand your hesitation to travel as the current situation unfolds. After reviewing your reservation, we’ve determined we’re unable to offer you a refund. Based on the fare rules, your ticket is non-refundable and the itinerary isn’t included in our current travel waivers. We realize this may be a different outcome than the one you hoped for; however, we want you to know there are options: You can use the value of the ticket toward future travel. You would need to cancel before your departure date and book your new flight within 24 months of the original ticket issue date. Please note that there may be a service fee and a fare difference for the voluntary changes to the ticket. If you want to keep your existing reservation, you’re all set. We’re closely monitoring this fast-moving situation and updating our travel waivers accordingly. We encourage you to review them on united.com close to your travel date for any new information. We appreciate you choosing United. Sincerely, United Refunds I want my money back not a no good voucher",-1
2020-05-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Puerto Plate via Newark,,,,,,,1,Terrible company,True,"  I purchased 4 tickets to the Dominican Republic from DC with a stop in New York City prior to Covid-19. Shortly after the Covid lock downs, the Dominican Republic closed it's borders. United only cancelled the second leg of the trip, which meant they were charging us $2200+ to fly to New York, the epicenter of Covid in the US. Mind you it's about a 5 hour drive from DC to NYC and NYC was shutdown. Who in their right mind would pay $2200+ to take that trip? The only option they gave us was to cancel the first leg from DC to NYC and now they are using this as a technicality not to provide a refund (because we initiated a cancellation on a basic economy flight, even though they cancelled the flight to my destination due to the border being closed). Go to NYC for what? There were no hotels and the city was shut down due to the pandemic. How does this make sense! United should have cancelled the entire trip and issued an immediate refund. This is how they are treating the American taxpayer despite getting bailed out with our taxes. Terrible company. According to the Department of Transportation, if the airline cancels the flight or there are significant delays, the customer should receive a refund. I can't buy food with an airline voucher.",-1
2020-05-09,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to San Antonio,,,,,,,1,do not care about their customers,True,"  I booked a flight back in March and cancelled the flight due to COVID-19. United gave me airline credit and I asked for a refund because I'm currently not working and have a family to provide for. They didn't care and said that I have the flight credit for 2 years. And I explained to them that I will not be traveling anytime soon due to financial hardship. I don't understand how a company can be so harsh and cruel, especially since people are out of work due to COVID-19. I was a repeat customer of United Airlines, now I will never fly with them again nor encourage others to fly with them. They do not care about their customers.",-1
2020-04-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chattanooga to Chicago,,,,,,,1, We need refunds not vouchers,False,  United is the worst airline! The way they are treating customers during the pandemic is shameful. We need refunds not vouchers. They could be winning over customers like their competitors but instead are screwing them over!,-1
2020-04-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Newark,,,,,,,1,I was offered vouchers,False,"  Booked two return tickets Heathrow to New York with United Airlines travelling 16th-21st April through Expedia. On 18th March flight times were advanced by 3 hours now departing at 12:00hrs not the 09:00hrs times. The return flight delayed by 2 hours. On 16th March UK Foreign Office directive was 'against all but essential travel to the US'. Also, on 16th March, US Homeland Security suspended, UK citizens travelling from the UK, entry into the US (If arriving would be quarantined 14 days)! On the 31st March both flights were cancelled by United Airlines via Expedia. I have now written numerous emails to United Airlines and have only received standard replies. Hiding behind the small print - T&C's state that if United Airlines cancel a flight a refund is in order unless another flight is available with 6 hours of the cancelled departure time (inc non refundable tickets)!! I wrote to the CEO only to receive a 'phone call from Customer Services telling me that a flight left Heathrow at 10:00hrs on 16th April and we should have been on it ? The very day the UK and US restrictions were introduced. I and Expedia knew nothing about this flight? I had NO tickets for this flight, no seats booked and no hold baggage paid for! I am horrified that United Airlines, given all the above restrictions on travel, could expect anybody to fly! United Airlines has no integrity, is unethical, dishonest, unrealistic,  devoid of Customer Service and just a money grabbing outfit all for the sake of 2 tickets. I was offered vouchers which were not acceptable, and in any event, after all of the hassle, I would not set foot on a United Airlines aircraft. Note both American Airlines and Delta have refunded, non-refundable tickets!",-1
2020-04-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale via Houston,,,,,,,1,United wouldn’t gave a refund,True,"  Absolutely disgusting. Couldn’t make it to our trip since our home country went it to lockdown because of the virus. United wouldn’t gave a refund because they are non refundable.. I guess that’s what they saying to everyone. Never use this airline again. And wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, because in case something happens you wouldn’t get your money back!",-1
2020-04-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Portland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United refused to fix their mistake,True," I had a horrific customer service experience with United Airlines recently and am absolutely mortified at how poorly I was treated, on top of United’s complete lack of disregard to its customers. I booked a United trip from SFO to PDX in December and rented a car through United (through Dollar UA). United messed up my booking at the airport, saying that I was going to be picking up the car from Portland City, even though my reservation stated PDX. This caused confusion at the Dollar UA counter, and caused me to incur and additional $50 in price due to United’s mistake. United refused to fix their mistake, and started pointing figures to Dollar UA, which then pointed fingers back to United. The customer service representatives I encountered were extremely unhelpful and highly incompetent. This was a months long saga that remains unresolved at the hands of extremely poor customer service and mistakes on United’s part. I feel United stole $50 from me and refuses fix their error, let alone admit any wrongdoing. They have lost a customer for life due to this horrifying and debilitating customer service experience that United can only blame themselves for.",-1
2020-04-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark  to Denver,,,,,,,1,disgusting and disappointing,True,"  Newark to Denver. I made flight reservations a month before this whole Corona Virus Epidemic started. Since last month I have tried calling the third party I made flights with (Cheapo Airlines) which I highly recommend staying away from too! Nether want to refund and I has been over a month and never received this so called voucher! This is ridiculous. This really shows how these Company's only care about money and not about the lives of there Customers. You can be sure my family will never fly United again or book with third partys, this is disgusting and disappointing.",-1

I started calling United Airlines before the plane left, for a long time I could not get through, my friend also called, they could not help us there. I wrote you a message in the mail, even went to an office in Moscow, where they refused to help me. After what happened two weeks later I had return tickets, they refused to return the money for them, they said that I had a non-refundable ticket and I could not claim anything although the rules state that I can return a ticket if I bought it for a week or more. but the company’s associates refuse to do this. And now they are not to answer me on my letters. This is a dishonest company. I do not recommend United Airlines.",-1

Reserved two tickets for March 26 and pay the insurance for any cancellation, obviously I had to cancel due to the coronavirus, I can never communicate to ask for my money back, pay $ 314 and ask me online proof of the cancellation. They send me emails saying that I have a credit. I don't want the credit I want my money back for that reason I paid the insurance and nobody gives me an answer.",-1

I am seriously disappointed that United Airlines could not refund the flight. Everything is canceled and its not in my control. Though the ticket are non refundable this is a special circumstance. I booked the departure flight through United and the arrival back through American Airlines,also non refundable, yet they came through with this crisis and refunded me back the amount without issues. It is just shocking and disappointing that United Airlines are unable to do the same.",-1
2020-04-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Tampa,,,,,,,1,refused to refund my money,False,"  As in so many other reviews here, United refused to refund my money. The trip was a business convention that was canceled due to the corona virus. Granted, it was a non refundable ticket. My hotel immediately refunded my deposit, which was also non-refundable. Delta, which is the airline I was using to get there, is in the process of refunding my money, again, a non refundable ticket. My flight back was on United. Went up the food chain and would not budge. A credit doesn't help me and neither does a cirtificate. I will never book another flight on United.",-1

I am a healthcare professional with lives to save but apparently they couldn't care less! Canceled my flight without so much as an email or phone call.

2020-04-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York City to Hawaii,,,,,,,1,refused to provide a credit,True,"  New York to Honolulu via Chicago. In mid March we had to cancel a scheduled trip (of four) due to the safety and health enforcements that were occurring as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. When we rescheduled the trip for a later date at a lower ticket price, United Airlines refused to provide a credit for the difference and we lost nearly $500. I was prepared to book a second trip had they provided the credit. During this unique COVID environment, when many socially responsible companies are helping to slow the spread of the disease and providing free/discounted service or relaxing their policies to those who are financially impacted by the outbreak, affected by the virus, and to health care workers who are at the center of it all, United Airlines still feels the need to nickel and dime their customers. It's very disappointing and unfortunate. Way to go United Airlines! You set the example of why so many dislike your industry. You would've actually made more money, had you provided a credit.",-1
2020-04-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Medellin to Kelowna,,,,,,,1,such poor service and ripoff,True,"  
My return flight was canceled. I rebooked at a premium and paid an extra $361 plus for that flight to be canceled May 5th. They sent me an itinary with 2 flights missing. I called reservations immediately to get an extremely incompetitent agent and rates person. I had to show her what date and my flight for May 18th from Medellin to Kelowna. I was only trying to book a return flight on economy which she told me she couldn't do. She wanted to book me economy plus at over $2,800 which was not return. Economy was $1125 but I shouldn't be paying anything as my flight was already paid for plus the $361 plus dollars that I paid. I ended booking my own flight economy at $1125 and have issued a complaint with United. I never experienced such poor service and ripoff.",-1

My flight was cancled the day of our date to fly out. It was canceled due to covid19 and the borders closed. I spent 2000 dollars in tickets that United is refusing to refund. They told me over the phone that I need to understand this is a business and they need to make money too.  I could understand if I canceled the flight to not give a refund but I did not do that and was not given service to what I paid for so in turn I should have the right to get my money back.,-1

I booked a flight during the virus scare with knowledge that if i can't fly i can reschedule, but lost my job in the midst of the shutdowns. I explained this to the manager saying I'd like a refund for the flight (i already applied this online). The man was careless towards the virus struggles, didn't work with me and told me tough when i said i can't pay for the airline after my loss. Just another big company worried about their pockets and not at all what they do for their customers.",-1

We were supposed to depart on April 3rd 2020. I waited as long as possible, giving United Airlines every opportunity to cancel my flight given the circumstances around this outbreak. I finally reached out to cancel my trip on March 30th (4 days before my scheduled trip). After spending over 4 hours, between on hold and waiting for a return call, United Airlines policy was to give me a credit for a flight later this year (I have to book a new flight before Dec 2020). My state is under quarantine, I can't even get to the airport, but they refuse to issue a refund. I have no plans to re-book this flight, so I will just be out $1000. This is money i need right now during this crisis. United Airlines is only concerned with their profit, not the health or well being of it's passengers. This is an outrage.",-1

I wouldn't be writing this type of review unless I truly was unhappy with the way I was treated. Travelling solo with two backpacks and a suitcase can be chaotic. I've never travelled with United Airlines before and I had no expectations apart from the staff being kind. Nope. I was flying from Chicago to Vienna and as I entered the aircraft looking for my seat, this rude stewardess is just standing where I'm supposed to sit. I kindly asked her to help me with this one heavy backpack I was carrying and she refused by telling me that ""her blue nails are just done and that it's not her job to help."" I stood there staring at her, dumbstruck. I truly couldn't believe what she just told me. I don't know if it was cause I barely had any sleep or if she was just truly rude! I sat by the aisle and every time she passed by, she would hit my shoulder and not once apologize. I understand it happens, but imagine hitting someone as if they were doing it on purpose.  I thought that she just happened to be one of those people and how it doesn't represent United. The food is okay-ish. When it comes to the rest, it's also okay. But I wouldn't fly with United again.",-1
2020-03-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Fort Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not the airline of common sense or compassion,True," I had purchased a non-refundable ticket from Houston (attend AISL Convention) to Fort Lauderdale (Join Royal Carrbbean cruise). Due to Covid 19, both my convention and my cruise were canceled. American Airlines gave me a full refund of my return flight home from Miami to Honolulu, even though the ticket was nonrefundable. United once again shows that it is not the airline of common sense or compassion. They were unwilling to do what every other airline did - namely, give a full refund for cancellation of flights due to Covid 19. Instead, they offered me only a credit toward a future flight. Now why would I ever want to ever fly them again? It is crystal clear that United exists to serve their pilots, machinists and flight crew. That's the honest truth. Hopefully, others will read this review and avoid the airline that places its customers last!",-1
2020-03-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Auckland via San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,cannot fulfil the terms,True," Washington to Auckland via San Francisco. WOW! In the age of COVID-19, everyone in New Zealand has been amazingly helpful about refunding booked hotels, cars, tours, excursions, internal NZ flights (Air New Zealand), except United Airlines. United canceled some of the flights in my itinerary, and instead of offering me alternative flights (because there are none), United is charging me a fee to redeposit my miles for an itinerary they cannot fulfil. If I try to return an unopened defective product to a store, does the store charge me a restocking fee because they cannot fulfil the terms of their contracted item:?!",-1

Staff were very accommodating despite working during such a stressful time. I had a feeling that ""we were all in this together"". I realized that while making several flight changes I paid twice/double for upgrades from economy to premium economy. I emailed United via their customer service site, explained the situation, and received refunds within 48 hours.",1
2020-03-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Newark,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,an upsetting experience,False," Frankfurt to Newark. The flight is not possible due to Corona travel restrictions. Instead of refunding the tickets United is offering flight credits with ridiculous restrictions. This is completely unacceptable. Moving the flight is currently impossible with the uncertainty of the Coronavirus outbreak, United flight credit restricted to use in the next 12 months is equally useless. Terrible customer service, lacklustre communication. All around an upsetting experience.",-1
2020-03-23,0.1,Business,Business Class,Newark to London,,,,,,,1,United is not refunding money,False,"  Newark to London. Despite being a frequent international corporate traveler and incurring conference and event cancellation, United is not refunding money for flights. They are holding onto it and compelling customers to accept a credit for future travel, at which point their fare will be inconsistent with the previous flight fares prior to COVID 19. They will definitely hike rates to recuperate any losses incurred. It is egregious they hold onto the revenue from flights no one was able to take and stand to earn more by charging the difference on top of the credit for future flights.",-1
2020-03-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to San Jose via Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,refusing to return money,False,"  Vancouver to San Jose via Houston. Every country's government is saying do not travel. We are being told that we should not be leaving our homes. Yet, United Airlines is refusing to return money to their customers. Who does this? My circumstance will not allow me to travel again with my family until, at the very earliest, March 2021. Yet my 'travel credit' will expire in February of 2021. I was told I will lose my $3500 that I paid for flights. The entire world is being told to stay home, and you people are still encouraging people to go out and ignore the recommendations for governments and health authorities.",-1
2020-03-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Tri-Cities,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly United again,False,"  Boston to Tri-Cities. Worst customer service in the world. Had to change flights due to corona and the website didn't let me use my future flight credit. The website kept flipping between the old site and the new site which made it extremely frustrating to use. I finally had to call and after a 2 hour and 10 min wait time, I was connected with a representative, we exchanged pleasantries and then she promptly said ""please call back later"" and hung up. 2 hours and 10 minutes on hold just to be hung up on! I finally called back later and after a 45 minute wait I was connected with a snake. I was looking at a flight that cost $200 per ticket and they were telling me that the cheapest flight available was $375! I will never fly United again. Southwest and Alaska Air are 10 times better customer service. The flight change for Alaska was a piece of cake and took less than 15 mins to cancel and re-book with a voucher directly to my email that was available for use instantly. United took 3 hours on hold, 2 phone calls, and 4 days for the voucher to be half-way usable. Couldn't use it to cover seat purchases either!",-1
2020-03-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington dc to Punta cana,,,,,,,1,They are keeping the money,False,  Washington dc to Punta cana. Stop flying this airline. I bought tickets 6 months ago to fly in March 2020. Now with all this virus going around i had to reschedule for July 2020. The new tickets are $400 cheaper but United refuses to give me a $400 credit back to use for future travel. They are keeping the money. Southwest airlines gives you credit for a future flight.,-1

I was supposed to grab my bag from customs and re-check it when I arrived in Chicago from Vienna, Austria, before getting on my second flight to DFW. I was unaware of this, however, and did not re-check my bag. The United staff was very helpful regardless of my mistake. They took my information and delivered my bag to my home within less than 24 hours! They were professional and helpful and I was very impressed!",1
2020-03-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Montreal to Hong Kong via San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,taking advantage of the situation,True,"  On December 21st, I booked with United Airlines to fly from Montreal to Hong Kong via San Francisco. My flight was schedule to leave on January 21st and come back on March 2nd. The days before my departure, the virus outbreak was getting worse in China with infected cases increasing drastically every day. Before leaving, I called United the same morning as my flight on January 21st to make a last minute trip change and make San Francisco my final destination instead (no refund asked). Besides being terribly slow on the phone, the personnel was also highly unhelpful. Not only weren't they caring about sending people in a growing epidemic, but even more, they charged me an additional 300$ to make this last minute change... for tickets I already in hands! So a roundtrip Montreal-San Francisco that could cost 450$ ended up costing me 1000$ + 300$ only to cancel my tickets to China and back. Not only are they being conning people and taking advantage of the situation to make profits, but they are also irresponsible being aware of a new crisis and not willing to help.",-1
2020-03-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Sao Paulo,,,,,,,1,United will not reimburse clients,False,"  I had an international flight booked that I will not be able to fly because: first, there is a pandemic going on; second the borders of each country are closed or will most probably be closed in the next few days. In face of these facts, it is very disappointing to see that United will not reimburse clients for cancelling the flights. Waiving cancellation fee is not enough. Most people will not be able to work and will need the money right away. Most airline companies are providing a full refund, giving the money back to their clients. They are showing empathy and compassion with the human being. United, you are not going to avoid bankruptcy being ruthless. These people probably will learn the lesson and never purchase a ticket with you again.",-1

Mariam, the primary stewardess who took care of us, was outstanding! We enjoyed every thing and couldn't be happier. The last time we flew United Airlines was in 2010 and it was awful. We flew from Abu Dhabi, UAE to Hawaii and the Plane, service staff, and entertainment was Horrible. We swore never to fly United again. The only reason we got this flight is because we went through Lufthansa and thought it would be this airline flying us. When we found out it would be United Airlines, we were saddened expecting the same bad  experience. However, it was not so, we loved it!",1

2020-03-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boise to Houston,,,,,,,1,denied a refund,False,"  Boise to Houston. With the Corona Virus, travel and accommodations have been canceled. We have asked for a refund since we won't have another chance before November to go anywhere and United has denied a refund. That is, unless we play their personal lottery and apply to the refund department which allegedly exists, you just can't speak with them. We have spent 3 minutes on the phone with the cruise line and hotel and received a full refund, BUT NOT WITH United. We have over 10 hours on the phone and have been told all we get is a credit or wait for the refund department that supposedly exists. I have had nothing but bad experiences with United and will never book a flight with them in the future if at all possible. I award them NO points and feel stupider after speaking with their representatives.",-1

2020-03-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Zurich to Washington,,,,,,,1,try to gouge customers,False,"  Because of CV-19, United added language to the top of their website stating they were making customer and employee health and safety their top priority - I found out first hand that this was not the case. Profits and ""policy"" are still king. When Trump announced he was closing the boarders with Europe, I tried to get the first flight back from Zurich to Washington, DC/Dulles. I was told an early return would cost me $7,000 even though I was on a business class ticket. If I wanted to return coach, it would cost still about $2,000 in addition to what I had already paid. I assumed the flights would be full. I went online and checked. United simply said, ""It is the policy, we can't change it."" I suggested that they should rethink their policy and not try to gouge customers who simply needed to return home to family in the time of crisis. Shame on you United for not providing the flexibility in time of crisis. This goes right to the top of the organization I'm afraid.",-1
2020-03-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Phoenix,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,1,Flight attendants are the rudest,True,"  Los Angeles to Phoenix. Second leg of flight from Lihue to Phoenix. This is my first and last time flying United. Flight attendants are the rudest I’ve ever come in contact with. Flying alone with my 4 kids ages 8-19. There are 5 of us and they just made $3500 out of my vacation budget from a single mothers salary. The snacks are gross, service is worse, and flight was delayed for “scheduling” problems. After a red eye back from Kauai with 4 exhausted kids and one tired Mama ... catching our second leg, our bags were tagged at the gate. We were told to leave our bags at the end of the tunnel and that they would be placed underneath and given back to us. Then the guy at the end of tunnel rudely told us to take them on board with us ... then when we took them on board and couldn’t find anywhere to put them, The flight attendant yelled and me and my son for bringing them on board. Then she proceeded to roll her eyes, take my suitcase and cram it into an overhead bin 12 rows behind ours all while Huffing and rudely yelling “YOU ARE WELCOME” at me in front of a dozen other passengers. I was humiliated on top of being completely exhausted. Never never never again will I fly united airlines. I’ll spend the money and go with another option next time.",-1
2020-03-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Asheville to Lisbon,,,,,,,1,they are charging fees to me,True,  United decided to cancel my flight booked for August 2020! This was their choice not mine.

2020-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Seattle,4.0,,1.0,,,5.0,1,chose money over health and wellness,True,"  Denver to Seattle. I arrived on the plane on 3/13/2020 during the height of the Coronavirus pandemic. The stewardess noted they attempted to spread out everyone best they could as the flight was more than half empty. Once everyone was boarded many rows had three people in them. The majority of the people on the plane were put in the back, and when one person asked to move forward to create space between passengers the entire plane was told if anyone wanted to move up past the exit row they would be charged. The priority is clearly not passenger‘a health and safety but money. The money was already lost and with a more than half empty plane during the height of the Coronavirus the airlines chose money over health and wellness. The plane ended going back to the gate for a two hour delay at which time I got off the plane and booked with another airline",-1
2020-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago O’Hare to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,Never again will I fly United,True,"  Chicago O’Hare to Las Vegas. I will not be flying United Airlines again. Believe it or not but economy ticket has become 3rd & 4th class. It’s hard to believe in this day and age that United has gone back to levels of classes. This plane was new. It had the first two sections of first class with dividers and large tv that you can sleep in. Then there is a business class section with larger mire roomy seats. And the last two sections are 4th class in which they made seats so small that an average size person can’t sit comfortably. I measured using the newest IPhone. It measures across 3 phone lengths plus 2 -3 more inches totaling a whopping 22 inches. And when the passenger reclines the seat in front of you there is no room at all. I paid round trip $350, the broad shouldered man next to me paid $99 and the big man next to him paid $600 round trip. United thinks they are pulling the wool over your eyes by offering free just released movies and ear buds. This is a travesty in the worst way by maintaining the class system. Wake up loyal customers! You are not getting anything for your loyalty but overpriced seats. Never again will I fly United. Thanks for nothing but making me so uncomfortable. If I could give zero stars that is what this airline would receive in most categories.",-1
2020-03-13,1.0,Business,Premium Economy,,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3,a thumbs up on the cancelation,False,  Just wanted to give United a thumbs up on the cancelation. I had to cancel 3 flight reservations because of the Coronavirus. With 3 different airlines. By far this was the easiest one to cancel with. You could do it on their website. I got an amount refunded to my cc. I got a credit to use on another flight. It did not take hours on the phone like with another airline. I was not hung up on several times like a whole different Airline. Good job United! Thanks for making it painless and easy. I appreciate it.,1

Flight was supposed to be at 9:00 A.M. Got delayed to 11:00 with no explanation. United delayed this flight 7 times. We did not leave until almost 4:00 P.M. They offered little bags of chips as consolation but never gave updates or offered to help in any way. I am disgusted with this airline.,-1

Half of the seats on our plane are empty, I guess “coronavirus did the job”. You would think United would greet those clients who took a chance with attention and appreciation, but quite opposite actually - stick to your seat, don’t move to an empty seat, 0.5 lb overweight luggage should be reorganized or $100 will be charged. And we had premier check-in. Afraid to ask how regular customers were treated! Horrible!!! I’ve been a loyal client of United for the past 20 years but now I think it’s time to try other airlines. And I got an email stating that all flight attendants will be wearing gloves while serving food and beverages - not the case.",-1

Tonight, we missed United Airline to go to Toronto. We had trip at Cancun until this morning for family trip and we left from Cancun after 2pm. But the United Airline was late one hour to get New Jersey. That's why we couldn't get next airplane. It wasn't our fault but we need to sleep in the airport with my three kids. My 4 years old little boy is sleeping the dunkin donuts on the table. We need to stay here for tonight. United Airlines didn't give to us right way. We still don't know when can we go back to Toronto.",-1

When the alert reached level 2 we became concerned and called to ask for options. Customer service told us that if Italy were to reach a threat level 3 that we would likely be in for a refund. Less than a week later lo and behold Italy reached level 3 as told by the CDC.  I requested a refund from United Airlines and after a week of processing I was told that I would not receive a refund as their ""sanitary practices are top notch"". I was told to either take my trip (and once again reminded by the service staff that it was dangerous to travel currently) or offered a ticket for a later date within the next year.  Hands down the worst customer service I've experienced and I'm utterly disappointed in this airline.",-1

The plane broke down as we were first pushed out for the take off. Got deplaned. I understand safety first.Missed our flight to Auckland New Zealand. Told the customer service person 3 times I could not hear her whispering to me but would still not speak up! Told me I had to check in 2 hours before to board my flight to New Zealand! 20 plus hour layover! Will not reimburse me for my seat selection purchase I lost! Tried to put us up in a terrible motel. Lousy food vouchers with no clue who would accept them. Tried to make sure my tickets were reissued and that staff member sucked too! Told me to go to the Air New Zealand and check in but didn't bother to tell me they wouldn't be there til 4:30pm. Lost a day of vacation, lost a night in a motel room I paid for. Lots of other fellow travelers were not happy. Do not plan to fly with this airline again after this.",-1

I have yet to talk to a united employee and have been in line since 11. My flight is tentatively scheduled to depart at 5, but they keep giving departure times and changing them. The app has a confirmation number that is incorrect and I can’t get anyone on the phone from the United number. The crew just left and I’m still in line. If you are thinking of flying United: don’t.

When I arrived at airport in St Louis to drop off my bag, the United Employee snapped and me and those around me and said she was too busy to help us. On my nine hour flight from Houston to Honolulu, no complimentary meal was served as is done on other airlines.The flight attendants were unfriendly. One of the male attendants made fun of me and a friend when we were having trouble getting the bathroom door open. I purchased Wi-fi for my flight to Honolulu and back and it never worked. I heard those around me complaining about the same problem. Our flight leaving Honolulu was delayed over 3 hours for a mechanical problem. The passengers were directed to get off of the plane. However, the United employees said that would not be helping change connecting flights until they knew how long the flight would be delayed even though some of us knew for sure we would be missing our connecting flight. I had to call United on the phone to get help. I was told that I would have to spend the night in Houston on the way back. I had to fight with United to get my hotel and food paid for. I was told that my baggage would be in Houston and when I got back on the plane the next morning for St Louis, I would be required to repay for my baggage even though United caused this problem. I was promised that my bag would be in Houston, but it never showed up. It arrived in St Louis the next day. My whole flight experience with United was a train wreck. When I asked them to reimburse me for my Wi-fi purchase, I was sent a canned response say they were sorry I was unhappy with my flying experience with them and they hoped I would fly United again.",-1

I booked a flight that had a layover in San Fransisco and I was originally needing to get back to Sacramento which I purchased. Later I found someone to pick me up early so that I wouldn’t have to wait the extra 2.5 hours to get for sfo to smf. I called to have my bags final destination be sfo instead and I would just get off the plane and head to my ride. They told me that because I’m changing my final destination it would cost me 325.00 to change my ticket. They later offered to wave 200.00 of that when I got mad but told me they have to change my ticket so it’s 125.00 change fee. If I didn’t have a checked back I could just get off the plane and go home but because I have that bag they are holding me hostage and forcing me to fly to Sacramento. Unbelievable.

United lost all the wheels on our luggage on our outward journey. We purchased new luggage but on the return journey we missed our connecting flight due to customs and the 35 minute regulations. We were sat at back on most of the flights so they usually ran out of a choice of food on one flight all we were offered was a chickpea curry not really something someone with IBS or a 5 year old will eat. The staff were non helpful and on return lost our luggage so we had to go and buy winter clothes and jackets. I emailed them countless times to no avail I finally got in touch with them  via facebook and they told me our luggage had been dispatched and would be with us shortly (we live 6 hours from airport). I received an email today from the company they used saying our luggage would be with us on 4th March between 4pm-8pm. They are now telling me I need to get in touch with the company you have chosen to get our bags back (almost a week later)? What kind of service is this? We travel frequently and our luggage has been lost before and the airline we used did everything in their power to get in contact and make sure we were clothed and our bags were returned to us the next day via a taxi service. United don't seem to really care a lot about customer service.,-1

Absolutely terrible customer service and airline! I don’t even know where to begin as I’m still at Toronto Pearson and the flight was supposed to be last night at 9:18 pm, it’s now 5:52 am and I still did not leave Toronto. First the flight was delayed and then cancelled. No direction from anyone anywhere. Finally an Air Canada employee gave direction on where to go and get help. I called the airline and all they could do is rebook the flight at 6 am. Once again I had to check in and go through the security process for the second time. The wait line was ridiculous this time around. This time they put my carry on aside and wanted to inspect (mind you I hadn’t left the airport). Doing this twice is stressful enough when you have a dying family member that you’re going to see, never mind having to deal with rude staff. One of the employees decided to go through my bag and put 3 items (small hairspray, body lotion and shower gel) into the liquid bag, then she picked through my make up case and took a lip balm and asked why I didn’t put it in the liquid bag. I stated that I didn’t think it was necessary to put it in the liquid bag, mind you she left my moisturizers and liquid foundation in the make up bag. I asked about those and she just threw the liquid bag into the carry on and stated that this was the procedure. At this point I was beyond frustrated and don’t even know what to say. This is unacceptable and you as the airline are responsible to educate your staff about customer service. I will never fly with United Airlines again. Now it’s 6:07 am and I’m departing so I’m sure something else will be going on at Chicago airport and more unpleasant surprises are awaiting after 11 hours for a flight that should take about an hour or so. Absolutely disgusting!",-1

Our 6 am flight was delayed this morning and at 9.30 am we are still in the airport when three other flights on different airlines have left without issue. The weather is fine but the pilot is walking around the airport saying the weather is at fault, being a little too cocky and smiling like it is no big deal to him. If all other flights can leave why can't we. Probably will never use United again.",-1
2020-02-26,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cape Town to Newark,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1,absolutely shocking service,True,"  Cape Town to Newark. I'm not sure this review will even be read and actually addressed but I feel that I need to let you as a very large and proud company know how absolutely shocking the service was. From taking off in Cape Town the nightmare began. My collegue and I started off by being denied water to take our tablets, I was willing to even pay but your non customer service orientated staff told us to wait until they come round with the trolley. We were seated the 2nd row from the back so that sip of water took very long to get to us. The staff were rude, abrupt and quite frankly ill equipt to be in the customer service industry. I would give you names of the exact staff members however they were not wearing name badges and when I asked a staff member when leaving she said they don't know each other's names which is hard to believe considering the duration of the flight. Whilst having my dinner I was knocked so hard by the trolley that my elbow is even bruised, the attended said after knocking me from behind to ""mind your shoulders"". Your staff need some serious training in customer service. Once we landed the nightmare just got worse. At customs we waited over 2hours standing in a queue and once at the gate we enquired how come there were so few gates for such a large amount of people needing to be cleared. Apparently United is known to not get their planning right and it's an ongoing struggle and not customs fault at all. Poor form United for such a large company. Due to this very long wait we then missed our connecting flight to Cleveland. We were sent to the wrong terminal from the get go after asking as we were completely unfamiliar with the airport and then we lead astray... Yes we know the gate subject to change however when at the gate our ticket said to board at, we were never told where we should have been all we were told was that this flight is going to Richmond . We had to ask 3 people at 3 gates before being directed to the right terminal and gate. The staff member who helped us actually called to let the gate know we were there and on our way. They said we had 6 minutes so we bolted as fast as we poosbly can. We were refused to board when we arrived and all the running was in vain. After traveling all the way from Cape Town we now had to wait around at the airport for another 5 hours at our own expense, we were exhausted and fed up on our very first experience with your airline. We are absolutely dreading our flight back to say least and I felt it necessary to let know so that it can possibly be addressed and that the next person doesn't have a similar experience. In general just disgusting service with a complete lack of care towards paying customers.",-1

First Class booking for this 5 hour flight was a joke - more like a mediocre economy class booking. No hot food; no amenities or menus; no food other than potato chips and other similar packaged snacks. Very uncomfortable seats that had terrible leg room and crew( who had nothing to do as there was little or no service) were loudly communicating amongst themselves thereby precluding sleep. We have flown on many different airlines in business class and this was by far our worst experience ever.,-1

The previous page I chose Swiss because of the opinions about United. Nothing could be more wrong. The plane was completely refurbished, service at the level and the entertainment system much wider than at Swiss. As for the seat space, it was plenty. The taste of dinner was really satisfying and you can easily say that it was tasty. Water and soft drinks no limit plus wine. Minus for a paid WiFi. I recommend. Leciałem 18letnim 767-400 z Newark do Tegla. W poprzednią stronę wybrałem Swiss a to właśnie z powodu opinii o United. Nic bardziej mylnego.

On a long trip they lost one of our most important bags. The people we talked to on the phone didn’t know how to help, we found out that it was in Santo Domingo about halfway through our trip but no calls, no emails, no texts to notify us. We had to buy all new gear and luggage for my son and I. We’re home now we still don’t have the bag back (it’s been a month and we just received word it’s in Texas, we live in Alaska), now they’re telling us they’re not going to reimburse us. I would highly recommend not flying with United Airlines if you can possibly avoid it, they do not care about their customers.",-1
2020-02-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Grand Rapids,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2,trip was overall a disaster,True,  Newark to Grand Rapids. I am deployed coming back from Afghanistan on my vacation and United airlines flight was delayed out of GRR and I missed my connecting flight due to the delay on their end. I was re-booked and was only given half the ticket so I had to pay out of pocket to my destination because of their error. I was told by a United airlines agent to buy the ticket and i would be reimbursed the full amount of the ticket that was paid to my final destination. I was lied to and I was only awarded a $300 dollar travel certificate but that ended up just costing me more for the total flight. I then emailed corporate customer service who were not helpful at all and in fact will not respond back to my emails after asking to speak to a manager about this. This trip was overall a disaster and I was stuck in the airport for two days waiting and I have never experienced anything like this before. I will not be flying United airlines again when they treat their customers like this.,-1

I used this airline to go from Nashville to Chicago and then from Chicago back to Nashville. The flight to Chicago was rough. Flight attendants didn’t seem to want to be there very unfriendly. The flight back from Chicago to Nashville they were attempting to get patrons to take the later flight. We arrive in Nashville upon arrival we receive a message letting us know that our bags would be on a later flight! Obviously the airline was aware luggage wouldn’t be on time, why not notify us before take off? I’m sure that would have made an impact on taking the later flight. Not only that but where’s the customer service in this?",-1
2020-02-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Kansas City,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly United again,False,  Chicago to Kansas City. Would never fly United again. Staff was rude and by the way the boarding process went it would seem that the staff lacked intelligence. It was as if it was everyone's first day. The staff had no idea what they were doing. Ran out of overhead space before 1/2 of the plane had boarded. They had everyone board with their bags for the overhead bins even after they had made an announcement that the overhead bins were full. Then proceeded to have people basically sitting on top of each other so these people could get back out of the plane to check their bags.,-1
2020-02-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Knoxville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly with this airline again,True,"  Denver to Knoxville. Long story short, this flight was delayed in Denver for technical issues and then rerouted to a closed airport in the middle of nowhere due to fog. I get the fog wasn't their fault but instead of just letting us go rent vehicles they kept leading us on twenty minutes at a time until finally putting us all in hotels at 3am. The next day we couldn't get back through security because our boarding passes didn't match the airport since we were rerouted and once we were finally through and out on the runway the flight was delayed again for technical issues. My wife and I finally just rented a car and drove home but now United refuses to reimburse us for the car rental. They gave us a $150 United credit which doesn't come close to covering the $500 flight that never even got us home, much less the car rental and the extra day we both missed work. Not to mention this $150 credit is basically Monopoly money. It's absolutely no use to me. I have no clue when or if I'll ever fly again so the credit will most likely expire without ever being used. I'll never fly with this airline again and I'll be sure to steer others away. I understand not all of the delays were their fault but they should have done the right thing by reimbursing us the amount we lost and with actual money not useless United credits. They could have had lifetime customers had they made up for the delays and taken care of us but instead they've created two lifelong haters of United Airlines.",-1

Had to fly back up to NJ then catch a flight to Houston, so a 2 hour flight turned into 4 hours. Houston flight arrived late so almost missed the connecting flight to Corpus. I needed assistance getting around airports due to blown out knee, people were extremely rude in all airports. Supposed to arrive in Corpus at 1.50pm, didn’t arrive until 8.30pm. On our way home, got on flights on time, until Washington, we flew into one airport but needed to be at Dulles (airline booked it that way not me) they made me find my own way there so $43 later on an Uber ride to the airport. We get to the airport get to the gate, planes delayed an hour due to mechanical issue. Then they say they don’t know when it will fly out. They then tell us the flight won’t be flying out until the next morning. I had to go a find a connecting flight to New York, I had to fly into Syracuse instead of Ogdensburg. Luckily I had someone who could pick us up or else we would’ve been stuck in the airport all night. I will never fly United again! Worst experience ever.",-1
2020-02-20,0.9,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Singapore,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,we were very pleased,True,"  San Francisco-Singapore return. Maybe I am lucky but I never have issues with United on international flights and this was no exception. We bumped up to Economy Plus as this is a 17 hour nonstop flight and the extra leg room was much needed. Departure was spot on time. The crew was friendly and pleasant. We had two meals and a snack with plenty of drink runs and water being served even during lights out time. Call buttons were responded to within 30-60 seconds. Our return flight was a bit more dramatic. We departed Singapore (1 hour delay) and were about 2.5 hours out. We had dinner and had watched a movie when a passenger in the rear of the plane became extremely agitated. He had mental health issues and was not on his medication. He had to be removed and placed in the galley. The captain made the decision to return to Singapore so he could be removed from the flight. So back we went. Arrived in Singapore, the police boarded the plane and removed the passenger, we exited, cleared immigration, gathered our luggage and was bused to a hotel for the night and day. We received meal vouchers for breakfast, lunch and dinner, then we were bused back to the airport the following night to fly home. The whole situation was handled very well by United. Plus we received a $200 voucher from United for the inconvenience. Our flight home on the second try was just fine with the same kind of service we received on our outbound flight. All in all we were very pleased with our United flights to Singapore and back.",1
2020-02-20,0.1,Business,First Class,Miami to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,now generally avoid United,True,"  I've flown nearly 2 million miles on United, mostly for business and mostly in coach, but as the overall quality of their flight experience has deteriorated, I've branched out to other airlines and now generally avoid United. Yesterday's 6+ hour flight was one of the worst I've ever had, so I wrote to United Customer Service this morning. The complaint and United's response are below. Both speak for themselves. I paid for first class on one of the longest routes you fly in the continental US (Miami to SFO).  I did not get a first class experience, or anything close to what I paid for.  For the second time in recent memory, I was aboard just about the oldest plane in the fleet, a 737-800 that must have been over 25 years old.  It had not been updated since delivery; the floors were filthy; the seats lumpy, without a footrest, and hugely uncomfortable; the power port didn't work (an issue for a business traveler on a 6.5 hr flight); no blankets or pillows were available; and the food was beyond terrible. I would like a refund, not miles, for this experience. I flew to Miami on American in coach.  Great experience.  Amazing food selections, comfortable seats, and excellent service. Response: I'm sorry our aircraft's appearance didn't meet your standards. I've reported your concerns so we can work with our airport teams and improve the cleanliness of our planes. Our goal is to make your flight as enjoyable as possible. I regret we let you down with the plane's appearance. Since you do not want goodwill miles, please accept our apology for your experience. We do not offer refunds based on your dissatisfaction with our aircraft.  We greatly value your loyalty; it's always a pleasure to serve your travel needs. We hope your next trip delivers the experience you deserve.",-1
2020-02-18,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,unfortunately a loyal customer,True,"  Las Vegas to Denver. Due to the fact that I live in a city that is a United hub, I am unfortunately a loyal United customer. United offers me more flight options and more non-stop flights as compared to other airlines flying in/out of my city so I must often choose united. However, uncomfortable flying experiences have become the norm. The things that I hate about United are: 1. the horribly uncomfortable ""torture device"" chairs that place neck and back in an incredibly uncomfortable position with head forward and no lumbar support. Who came up with this seat design and has anyone at United actually tried to use these seats? 2. Baggage hassles including incredibly restrictive carry on policies and ""nickel and dime"" fees. The worst is a requirement to pay a bag fee in order to check in and receive a boarding pass for some customer classes, regardless of whether or not the traveller actually has luggage. On my last 3 flights, my only luggage was a small personal item that I did not plan to check (a backpack), but I had to pay a checked bag fee in order to check-in for my flights. 3. frequent delays, over-bookings, etc and policies that make it difficult (and sometimes impossible) to change flights.",-1

UA changed the aircraft 4 times since we booked in March 2019 including twice in the two days leading up to departure. However the end result was we were moved up to the section for global service members which is the old first class section so we had plenty of room and the seat comfort was very good. Of course that is not all that goes into an evaluation. Including the service, IFE and the food we were thoroughly pleased. We were treated very well. The FA's worked tirelessly and were very attentive. In addition as thus was a Polaris class service we used the Polaris lounge in Chicago which is excellent so all in all this was a very pleasant experience.",1

2020-02-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Jacksonville to Denver,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,don't know what they're doing,True,"  Jacksonville to Denver. I arrive at the counter and instead of the employee behind the counter processing my check-in, I process my check-in. The whole thing. I'm the one paying, but I'm the one doing the work. This was even more-so on the way back at DEN. I'm on the aircraft sitting in my tiny first-class seat. The pilot comes over the intercom and announces that because it is snowing at the United hub in Denver,(who'd of guessed Denver would do that?), some of our bags would not be going with us on this flight. Apparently, the airplane United uses to fly non-stop from JAX to DEN, (Embraer something-something), cannot carry the baggage that United promised to carry when they advertised non-stop service from JAX to DEN when it is snowing in DEN. Where United has a hub. They sell tickets for non-stop service from JAX to DEN, but they can't carry the baggage. So, whose bags do you think they select for non-service on this flight? If you guessed first class passengers who bought their tickets with money, you guessed correctly!  In thanks for buying the most expensive ticket on the plane, United rewards you with leaving your bag in Jacksonville! Who wouldn't want to fly United again after that? Then, during the flight from JAX to DEN (sans luggage), they serve what we shall call for lack of alternative terminology, ""breakfast."" It is, and I quote the first-class flight attendant as she described it to the passenger seated in front of me, ""shelf-stable cheese product.""  I'm not sure, because, while first-class (did I mention this comedy takes place entirely in first-class?) flight attendant offered this shelf-stable cheese product breakfast to all of my first-class companion passengers, she never actually offered it, or anything else, to me. I was ignored throughout the flight. But I did get to listen to the gossip between the economy class flight attendant and the first-class flight attendant for about an hour and half of the flight, covering topics from dating experiences to career aspirations or lack thereof. So, I land in Denver, intending to head into the mountains, without the contents of the suitcase I assumed (first-class ticket, non-stop flight to the airline's hub airport) would have arrived with me on my flight. Examples of missing items: boots, crampons, poles, ski jacket, underwear, so on and so forth. The check-in at Denver for the flight back was even worse, but the fight itself much better. No complaints with the DEN to JAX crew on the plane. But the JAX to DEN crew were depressingly lame. When I was younger, I used to travel on Greyhound and Trailways bus lines. I do not exaggerate to state that I have had better experiences there than in United first class (at least they never left my bag behind). The management don't know what they're doing. It's a disaster.",-1
2020-02-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Guam via Honolulu,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,1.0,1,Please address this issue,True," Manila to Guam via Honolulu. I was always happy and satisfied whenever I fly with United but my last trip was a disappointment. This is not actually a review but a suggestion to modify their system regarding infants flying outbound less than 2 years old but already 2 years old when flying inbound. This is to avoid confusion, discussion, disappointment. I booked our flight (1 adult and infant on lap) on Sept 11, 2019 flying out Dec. 24, 2019 and flying in Feb. 12, 2020. United.com system asked to put in the birthdates of the passengers so therefore from there on the system should have prompted me to buy a seat for my infant child since she will be 2 years when flying inbound but sad to say it didn't, so therefore, on the day of our flight (inbound) I ended arguing, discussing, unhappy because I had to buy on the spot a seat for my infant baby who just turned 2 years old 5 days ago. My point is what if I dont have cash or credit card with me? If only the system prompted me that I need to buy a seat for my baby since she will be 2 years old coming back I would have bought her round trip seat. Please address this issue to avoid passengers like me to experience this.",1

The plane left the gate 40 minutes after I arrived. The United rep was more interested in her phone and getting out of there than helping. Now the later flight is 2 hrs late. United decided to tell everyone that the new gate is E2 not F15. Once I got to E2 they changed it back to F15? I have been a loyal customer of United for 25+ years.

Airline food is usually not known to be good, but food on this flight was one of the worst menu - blend, not properly warmed, tasted horrible. United really needs to get feedback from passenger on each flight segment. Horrible service level. Except for one young flight attendant, rest of the flight attendants were there as a favor to passengers. Except for serving food once and service breakfast once, they did not cater to any passenger needs. I needed help twice - once water to take medicine, and then to get breakfast which I missed as I was sleeping when they distributed. In both cases, I waited and waited but no one bothered to respond. I could not get up as I was in window seat. This is my third time flying with United in last two years - same experience each time. Time to say goodbye to United. I will stick with my Delta!

The cost of domestic flights is insanely expensive. The probability of getting delayed is close to 100%. And the delay can occur more than once. Because of this problem, students from Purdue like myself, are forced to change bus shuttles to our universities. In some cases, find a place to stay overnight and pay extra because there are no other bus shuttles available. One thing I notice is always the delay is a technical delay.

2020-01-31,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Duluth to Palm Beach via Chicago,2.0,,2.0,1.0,,2.0,1,become  one of the budget carriers,False,"  Duluth to Palm Beach via Chicago. United has officially become - in my mind - one of the budget carriers (Spirit, Frontier, Allegiant, etc.). The fact that they're the only of the Big 3 to charge for a carry-on (American, Delta, and United) must put them in that category - they're just a lot bigger than the other budget carriers. I guess the good news (if you can call it that) is that United is now a new 'global' budget carrier option! They're also more expensive than all the other budget carriers. The most expensive by far. Delta is way better than American and United, but now United has removed itself from that category of carrier. I fly at least once a month, used to be forced to choose between American and United because of ORD - nice that I don't have to make that decision anymore. Save $ and fly with one of the more affordable budget carriers, or spend a smidge more to fly with one of the Big 2 (American or Delta).",-1
2020-01-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Delhi,,,,,,1.0,1,not familiar how e-visa to India works,True,"  San Francisco to Delhi. United employees at SFO refused my wife and children boarding because united are not familiar how e-visa to India works. E visa is visa on arrival which is has a Electronic Travel Authorization or ETA. A traveller needs to arrive in India before it expires and once you arrive a 30 day visa is stamped. Since we decided to travel closer to the eta expiration date four United officials denied boarding, refused to listen.  Solution: since original ticket was from Jan 29th and returning on 12th of Feb and ETA on Evisa was from Jan 6th to Feb 4th, United airlines rose to the occasion and changed the return ticket to Feb 4th. So now once we get our 30 day visa after we arrive in Delhi .. we will shell out more money to buy another ticket.",-1

No even one smile. Very pour entertainment.",-1
2020-01-28,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Greenville,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United continues to fail,False,"  Newark to Greenville. United continues to fail. I’ve had several bad experiences with the company throughout all of the times I’ve flown with them. My flight was suppose to be in seat C5. I was then moved to the furthest seat in the jam-packed plane. After I got through the mess of people arguing over a double booked seat, we eventually got on the runway late. After this, they claimed that something had to be done to the plane. They told us we needed to wait 20-25 more minutes, a serious inconvenience to someone who has planned out rides. I have never had these issues with any other airline.",-1

2020-01-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft Lauderdale,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,never fly with United again,False,"  Newark to Ft Lauderdale. I have made a reservation on cheapflight.com for three passengers to go to Florida. They flew us in with JetBlue and we had no problem and had three carry-ons to travel with. On the way back our flight was with United, when we tried to check in she didn’t let us take our carryons on the plain and requested to pay $30 for each carryons to check them in. She said this was written on the site, but it wasn’t or perhaps it was fine prints that no one could see it. I thought to myself that perhaps I made a mistake, but I was not alone, almost 20 other passengers had the same issue and had to pay extra. This was so absurd, ridiculous and cheap, I felt like I was being rubbed and had no choice. I will never fly with United again!",-1
2020-01-26,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington Dulles to London Heathrow,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,Flight attendant hospitality has improved,True," Most recently flew on UA 918 from IAD to LHR. The international economy class experience has improved in many aspects since I started flying with them, although the economy class seats are a bit tight on the new 777 aircraft. The new in-flight entertainment system on the recently-serviced international jets is worlds better than the old one, and it seems like most are starting to use it now and are putting their iPads away. Best to sit on the clusters of seats closest to the window instead in the middle of the airplane. In-flight services like food and drinks and providing extra bedding have been very good, though I wish they provided hot towels again for economy passengers. I've always requested it from them through corporate channels and hopefully they'll consider it from the many who have asked for it. Flight attendant hospitality has improved the most out of anything. Some have said Delta is the best internationally-flying airline for America, but I think UA is just as good now. I've flown with UA regularly since 2016 because of their good ticket prices on the relatively competitive Washington to London route I use frequently for school travel, as well as their competitive frequent flyer program. As I am more time-sensitive than most travelers, I look for the best nonstop option. They've usually been on-time with their international itineraries (possibly due to strict ETOPS rules and what not). I've heard great things about their new Polaris Business class but I didn't fly on it yet, so I can't comment personally. If you haven't flown them lately, I'd suggest giving them a try. You might be surprised at what's changed.",1
2020-01-25,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Amsterdam via Newark,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,not even close next to each other,True,"  San Jose to Amsterdam via Newark. I checked in at the AirPort by a counter 24 hours before my departure. I was mistaken with the date of departure. But the advantage is we could choose our seats and we got our boarding passes already. Next day we only had to drop our luggage. The desk employee printed new boarding passes with right gate number on it and changed our seats without telling or mentioning to us. We found out when we had to board, we were seated not even close next to each other. If we wanted to change seats we had to pay $124 dollar each. And we were told that seat places are not guaranteed. This is bad service considering the duration of both flights and the fact that we checked in probably first of all passengers.",-1
2020-01-25,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to London Heathrow,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,5,largely uneventful,True,"  Washington to London Heathrow . An uneventful flight though I wish United flight attendants would just be more welcoming and smile more! This Monday evening flight from Washington Dulles to London Heathrow was largely uneventful. I estimate the cabin was two thirds full. So boarding was fairly smooth and the aircraft pushed off on schedule. As there was some turbulence after take-off, dinner service was slightly delayed. When served, there was a choice of Chinese chicken or vegetarian pasta. The chicken dish was fine while the accompanying salad was very appetising. Vanilla ice-cream was served for dessert. After dinner, lights went down while water bottles were handed out regularly for guests to rehydrate. Prior to landing, a light breakfast snack was handed out: good quality strawberry yogurt left down by a poor quality croissant with jam though no butter. Overall, the flight was fine. It would have been a much better experience if the flight attendants were more personable. Even among themselves they did not appear to enjoy their job.",1
2020-01-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to San Francisco,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,2,worst airport experience ,False,"  Salt Lake City to San Francisco. At the gate boarding the plane I was stopped and my personal item bags size was checked. My backpack has lots of straps so they would get caught. After tucking the straps in my bag fit just fine. However, my gate attendent told me it didn't fit and she would be charging me. I declined as I and the people around me all noted my bag fit in their predetermined slot size. She replied I would not be able to fly unless I paid and as I had no choice at the gate I had to pay, however her attitude was rude and condescending and it's safe to say that before I even stepped fit on the plane it was my worst airport experience ever. It is safe to say I will never fly United air again after this trip unless the 65 dollars she charged me at the gate is refunded. What a nightmare she was. United you should have a talk with this gate attendent who was absolutely terrible to deal with.",-1

The staff seems like they could care less. I'm sure after the 4 hour delay time there will be another delay. Can't United get us a different plane? I don't even feel comfortable flying in a plane that was just repaired. Also the plane is so absolutely uncomfortable, I'll never fly United airlines again. 0 stars",-1

Flight delayed from Miami to Newark because of problem with plane, that happens. I was told that an agent would meet me at the gate to help me to get to the connection gate. No one was there Got to the connection gate, plane still there, they would let me board. Told to go to customer service, no one there. Called customer service, on hold for more than an hour and was told they couldn’t help me but there was no customer service at airport, it was midnight. What to do?

But then we took the four hour flight from Newark to Panama City and couldn’t be more pleased with the service that we received. Alex and the woman with him did an excellent job. Alex was so personable and attentive that it was a pleasure to fly with him. I ordered the beef and it was very good. Good job United.,1
2020-01-17,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Newark,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,5,my experience was very good,True,"  Dublin to Newark. United gets a lot of bad press, however my experience was very good. Online check-in via the United app was easy; there were no queues at Dublin airport for the bag drop-off. Staff at the bag drop and boarding area were efficient and courteous. The aircraft pushed back on time and arrived ten minutes ahead of schedule into Newark. The FAs were again efficient and courteous, though not particularly friendly; a few more smiles would have earned them a higher rating. Alas, the breakfast meal was not tasty, actually very bland. So again some room for improvement. Against these quibbles, the fare was excellent value, a new Boeing 787 and very good punctuality.",1
2020-01-16,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Everett to San Francisco,,,,,,1.0,2,horrible and incompetent service,True,"  Everett to San Francisco. My early morning flight was delayed due to weather problems in the morning while other airlines reroute their flights from SFO to San Jose airport. After coming back to the front desk I was ""recommended"" to re-book and put on the next flight which one was after 6 hours because the front desk assistant said this flight could be ""cancelled"". I had to wait for 45 minutes at the luggage counter to get my checked in bag. Immediately when I got my bag the original flight was rescheduled again ... I rushed back to the gates,  and they closed gates right before my eyes missing that just by 30 seconds. I don't know how they can justify that. I have never experienced such a horrible and incompetent service.",-1

We managed to still make it to San Antonio via other means but on our return flight, we found out that United had canceled our return flight because we were unable to make the first one. They’ve always consistently been a pretty terrible airline (especially when flying internationally) so to be honest I’m not really surprised they would do something so stupid.",-1

While flying with United, I had some great comments, mainly being appointed to the pilot, as well as several terrible experiences regarding customer service.

Something must be done about how we were treated because our time with United was completely unacceptable.",-1

All round a pleasant experience. Polaris Business is a vast improvement over the former 8 across business class configuration. Food was excellent (I took the Japanese meal), and service was always friendly and warm. The selection of movies and tv was enormous. United has cut back on some of the amenities first introduced with Polaris and I think this is a mistake because the cutbacks diminish United's ability to distinguish itself. In most important areas, however, the flight was just fine.",1

We arrived at the airport at 9:15 am for an 11:41 am flight. We were told that there was a problem with the aircraft and there would be a delay.

2020-01-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Ft Lauderdale via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst flying experience,True,"  Spokane to Ft Lauderdale via Chicago. My experience started when I checked in online the night before. I started to check in and received an email that I was only allowed a personal item and had to check any carry-on luggage. Although I believe a carry-on should be a standard accommodation I figured I would just do it when I got to the airport since the one I was flying out of is not very busy. I was very disappointing to find out that you must check your carry-on when you check in online or you are denied checking in until at the gate. To avoid bad seating I just did it online and payed the $30. When I got to the gate, things started to go south again. The crew was rude and not very accommodating. None of them smiled. The flight (end of December) was delayed because they had to de-ice the plane which is okay. To not get the fumes of the de-icer in the plane, they turned off the air conditioning so things got stuffy and hot real quick. The plane did not return below 80 degrees for the rest of the flight.  I also happened to be in the row of seats that don't recline at all because of the emergency exits but the person in front of me did recline. So on my overnight flight I did not get any sleep because the conditions were so uncomfortable. During the flight, there was ""bad turbulence"" which was really actually mild so the crew did not provide the normal in-flight service. Because it took so long to de-ice the plane, I almost missed my connecting flight. Now, remember how my carry-on had to be checked. When I got to Florida, I was informed that my carry-on had not made it and would not for a several hours. This caused my girlfriend and her family whom I was visiting to have to wait around for several hours. The first relief I had with this terrible experience was the man at baggage claim service who did his best to justify some of the situation. He reimbursed the $30 for checking the missing carry-on and gave me a $10 food voucher to get lunch for the extra hours I was spending at the airport. He told me he deals with the product of terrible service all day and doesn't understand why United doesn't do more to value the customer experience. But he said his input is disregarded whenever he tries to raise the issues he sees everyday that could be easily fixed. Overall, this was the worst flying experience I have ever had and would recommend to any friend or stranger that they avoid United Airlines if at all possible. I will not be flying with them again if at all possible.",-1

United is the worst airline I have ever flown. They changed our flight to two hours earlier and did not notify us at all. When I contacted United customer service they refused to apologize. When they rebooked our flight they refused to seat my husband and I together. I was stuck in a middle seat far away from my husband, even though there were multiple empty seats together throughout the plane. The flight attendants were very off putting. We will never be flying this airline again. Stay away from them at all costs!",-1

I usually plan my vacations half year prior to be able to choose convenient flights and seats together for my family. Right before going to airport I received a message that my airplane is about to depart. I called representative and he told me that my flight was changed (-4 hours). I did not receive any notifications. The representative offered me flight for next day. I planned ski trip on Christmas week (expensive rent, lift tickets) and loosing 1 day equal losing $700. I explained it to the representative but he repeated: ""Your flight is tomorrow"". When I asked his name or employee id, he refused, I asked to talk to his supervisor, he refused and then dropped the call. When I called second time I was able to talk to supervisor and he offered me current day flight with seats all over the plane. After we came to Salt Lake City we realized that United lost our skis. They told us that they will bring our skis approximately at 1am. I almost did not sleep whole night receiving one message after another. Finally we received skies at 3:30 am. The flight back seats were also changed without any notifications. We were very frustrated and will try to avoid this company going forward.",-1

Compensated for about a 1/4 of it. This time both flights were delayed. The second because they had to completely deplane after fully boarded to change a tyre. When asking for a meal voucher, the attendant lied and said it was due to weather so no voucher could be given. Time and time again they astonish me with their lack of care for customers, unprofessional behavior, and inefficiency. Last time I ever fly United.

Hats off to the friendly and efficient ground staff. Flight on time. Disappointing that they only offered water and cola on this flight, although to be fair it is only about an hour. They had a nice variety of snacks to make up for it. I wouldn't give it a very high value for money rating as this flight has been expensive for decades (no competition).",1

Staff are rude, flights are always delayed, and seats are very uncomfortable. On one of the flights my daughter was nauseated and we couldn’t even find a vomit bag in any of the seats around.

2019-12-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Newark,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst experience,True,"  Orlando to Newark. Flying with United airlines and Copa airlines is the worst experience my family and I ever had. We have lost so much money with them from unnecessary hotel expenses, taxi expenses, parking, car rental and many more inconveniences. We flew close to Christmas season which I think makes them even worse when they should put their best effort to accommodate and make their clients happy. My husband, my 5 month old baby  and I decided to travel with United airlines and had a connection with Copa from Newark to Panama to reach our final destination in Ecuador. As soon as we arrived to Newark airport we went to the machines to finish out check in and check our luggage. Then we made the line to drop off our luggage we had 6 large pieces of luggage since it was my husband, my self and the ticket we bought for our baby to take the carseat. When they weighed our luggage we had 2 - 50pound pieces, 1 - 37 pound, 1- 42 pound, and 2- 51 pound luggage. The guy who helped us was not friendly at all and indicated us to go back to take the 1 pound that we had over our luggage. After we re packed we went back on line to another rude assistant that passed us. When we waited inside for the flight, I approached the the counter to ask for assistance getting my husband to sit next to my baby and I, they had placed us very far from each other. Same problem rude person said you gotta figure it out inside there's nothing we can do. When we boarded the plane, we realized they had placed my 5 month old baby on a seat separate to mine! United airlines has nothing but incompetent employees. We payed $1000 for each ticket plus a ticket for our son and all they gave us is a cookie and something to drink. The airplane was dirty, small, uncomfortable, and turbulent.  When we arrived to Guayaquil, we pick up 2 bags out of 6 at the baggage bel and 4 bags missing. When we went to the airport for baggage claims, Copa Airlines told us that United airlines kept our luggage in Panama and they would take from 24 to 48 hours for us to get our baggage! We came back the next day (keeping us from going to our next destination) for updates and didn't receive anything. Stayed at the airport from 6pm to 1am with no one wanting to help Copa would tell us to come back later and didn't want to help us or give us any updates, they didn't care that I had a 5 month old baby at the airport for hours waiting for any information on our luggage in which we had our baby's clothes, diapers and even medicine. I called United airlines and they said they would arrive at 11pm but of course they didn't. Eventually after talking to everyone in the airport we were able to talk yo someone for them to send the bags to our next destination Loja. They told us we would receive them on Tuesday, we went and they had only sent 2, told us that maybe the next day we'd get the rest. Finally on Wednesday we received the other 2. These 2 airlines have caused so many inconveniences and unnecessary expenses for my family, and we weren't the only affected ones.  I wouldn't travel with them again!",-1
2019-12-26,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Denver,1.0,,2.0,,,2.0,3,never recommend this airline,True,"  Worst experience I’ve had with any airline. The workers misinformed me about my flight information due to me being late to my original flight. They checked my bag and sent to Colorado, even after I specifically requested that not to be done. I ended up spending double for a last minute flight with Delta. I would never recommend this airline ever. Not even for a quick flight the workers don’t care if you make it or not.",-1

2019-12-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Honolulu to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,never use United again,False,"  Honolulu to San Francisco. I purchased tickets, a month prior to our departure. I am active duty military, and I only get to come home every so often. I was late for both of my flights, and I waited for over 12 hours for the last of my flights. I managed to make it home for Christmas Eve, but I slept most of it, because of all of the running around at the airport. I have never had this trouble with any other airline, and I promise I will never use United airlines again. I would have swam if I had known it would take this much of a struggle to get on an airplane that I purchased insurance for as well as the $1200 dollars. What a horrible airline. Merry Christmas United.",-1

Upon boarding we were approached by United Airline representative, when we asked if there were 2 seats together, he stated “but they’re basic economy”. He then returned and said, “no, they’re basic economy and the gate attendant hadn’t updated her screen .. there’s no seats together”. What a rude and belittling comment.

2019-12-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,It was a complete nightmare,True,"  I was trying to fly out of Lax to Puerto Vallarta today for our family Christmas vacation. I am a green card holder. The UA representive did not let me even check in for my flight as they did not accept the extension (separate official letter from US immigration) on my green card. They said that Mexico will not let me enter the country with that extension. I travel to Mexico all the time, last time being less than a month ago. I never had a problem flying with other companies (Delta, Alaska). The UA representatives were completely useless, rude and sounded like a broken record saying that Mexico will not let me enter the country. I showed them multiple stamps of entering Mexico and then returning to the US. They just kept repeating that I wont be allowed to enter Mexico. It was a complete nightmare. They offered to refund my ticket. And then they were stupid enough to ask my husband if he would like to cancel his ticket knowing very well that we were traveling together for our holiday vacation. Long story short we were unable to fly out. As it is the holiday season all the flights were sold out forcing us to cancel our travel plans. So United completely ruined our holiday plans. Absolutely horrible experience.",-1
2019-12-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Salt Lake City,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"Shame on you, United Airlines",False," Chicago to Salt Lake City. How about some loyalty to your customers. I booked my flight 5 months in advance. You switched me to a cheaper, very early flight, without telling me until the day before the flight when you reminded me to check-in. You claimed that it was because my flight was cancelled. Come to find out that you just changed the number of the flight. It was still at the same time and the same nonstop flight from ORD to SLC. When I asked to be placed back on my confirmed flight, you told me it was sold out. I can only surmise that you threw me and my family of 5 off my flight to sell more tickets at a higher price since it was a holiday weekend. Shame on you, United Airlines.",-1

Avoid this company, especially if you are a family as it will cost you more. You pay full price for kids over two, in addition they are operating with a new low lower-class ticket where they will place all family members apart. In order words, if you want to sit next to your family they will make you pay more. On top of that we were held up at the airport for several hours as there was a variety of problems. Not worth it for anybody, but especially hard on families.",-1
2019-12-21,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Frankfurt,,,,,,2.0,2,miss on all of the holiday cheer,False,"  Newark to Frankfurt. This relates to flight UA960 on 12/19 out of Newark. Our flight was at first delayed by an hour - typical, but manageable as we had about 2 hours to connect in Frankfurt to our final destination; Beirut. And then as it often happens with United, the closer we got to our revised departure time, the more delay notices we got. Upon the 3rd one, it was clear we would never make our connection. We then called the support line and a very helpful representative assisted us, looking for viable options. Unfortunately, nothing was available. Reluctantly, we had to re-book our entire trip, departing on 12/22 instead of 12/19. Now we’ve spent 5 hours waiting in vain at Terminal C, burnt $120 in taxi fares, and $150 on a sub-par airport dining experience. But, more importantly, we find ourselves with a flight to Beirut that has me waiting 11 hours in Frankfurt. We land late at night on Christmas Eve and will miss on all of the holiday cheer that we normally partake with our families as we prepare for Christmas Day. I will be tired, sad and stressed out because you are doing a very poor job of running this company.",-1

Cabin crew were friendly and helpful, especially the one on my return flight. Even though the flight was barely 1 hour, free sodas/orange juice/pretzels and other options were there. I missed my return flight by half an hour and guess what, they put me on the next flight free of charge. All this on Basic Economy ticket. Thank you United!",1

We got on the plane, then they told us that they have some maintenance issues. We waited on the plane for more than 45 minutes. Then they asked us to deplane so they can do some test runs. We waited for  two hours and every time they told us that the test run failed. Then they asked us to go to the customer service to find another flight. We waited for more than 6 hours in the line and the line was getting longer by minute. It was finally our turn and they gave us another flight from a different airport one day later, no food voucher and no hotel voucher. We went to get our checked-in bag, we had to wait for over 2 hours to see someone. They told us that they don’t know when we get our bags and need to wait at a carousel for our bag. They kept bringing their plastic containers instead of our bags. We waited over 4 hours to get our bag. This experience will be our last one with United Airlines.",-1
2019-12-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Medford,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst customer services,True,"  San Francisco to Medford. United airline has the worst customer services. Lack of available options for customers when their flight gets cancelled. They don’t care about your situation and none of the workers at the customer service or at the gate even apologize for the inconvenience. All they say is “we can’t do anything about the weather.” I suggested for people who wants to fly with United Airline, if you don’t plan on buying first class flight then don’t buy it at all because any flight status below that will received no respect.",-1

My flight to Singapore got cancelled. The next flight given to me was 2 days later. They did not provide any accommodation. I called the customer service and she gave me contradicting information from what the United Airlines counter at the airport was giving me. The line to speak with customer service was a 2 hour wait ... and I was in the front of the line. It was seriously inhumane. Parents with small kids were lining up (for 2 hours) to get even a snack since it was 1am and all the food stores were closed in the airport.At least have the decency to compensate us or pay for our accommodation while waiting.,-1

My flight from Durango   was delayed which made me miss my connecting flight to YYC. I talked to the agents at the counter right away to see what they can do for me. They told me they can give me a guaranteed seat on the 7pm flight or standby for the 1.30pm flight. Thats a 10hr layover and all they offered me was a $10 voucher. She wasn’t very nice about it either and made me feel like it was such an inconvenience for her. I did get on the 130pm flight but that flight was delayed too and didn’t leave til 430pm! To top it all off my luggage wasn’t on the same flight as me and was told they’re going to deliver it to my house in the morning. Next day comes I get a call from them at 9am saying that the driver is leaving the airport to deliver my luggage at 10am! It’s currently 12.46pm and my luggage is still not here. I only live 20min away from the airport. I have errand to do and im stuck here waiting for my damn luggage to be delivered. Not to mention my work tools are in my luggage. Luckily I’m off today!,-1
2019-12-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Singapore,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2,become a very disappointing airline,True,"  United is always boasting about concern for customers. And when you bring a legitimate question or situation that needs to be explained or corrected, they always respond via e-mail with a words that sound like they care. But I have experienced time & time again: They are just empty words. It's as if they just 'plug in' certain key words or 'catch phrases', but dont really act on the problem. I had several troubling encounters with a reservation/check-in, a counter agent handling another leg of our very long flight. Both were extremely stressful to my wife and I! I tried to contact United to clear things up; It has yet to be resolved! They barely addressed my concerns at all. United has become a very disappointing airline to us. And sadly, we've been with them for many years. United Airlines has truly become like many other huge corporations - ""Profits before people""!.  What makes it worse, their constant claim to 'do things for us, the customer! In words & their own videos, only.",-1

I have never encountered such incompetence, from the pilot, staff, and airline itself. The flight was originally delayed for 4 hours. We finally get to board (late), and it takes 30 minutes to get to the point to de ice. At this point, they figured out they somehow broke the steering mechanism. No information was given during this time, and they somehow made us miss an international flight when we originally had a 7 hour layover in Chicago. I cannot begin to describe how unimpressive this entire ordeal was. They lost my business for good.",-1
2019-12-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Charleston,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,2,first and last time with United,True,"  Our flight kept getting delayed by several hours then it finally just cancelled around 5pm, we have to rush to get a new flight. They were not able to get us a new flight until 9:30am the next day, the customer service guy asked us if we wanted to fly into a “close airport” instead of our home airport. How they compensated us was giving us a $10 voucher, which almost buys a sandwich for the night we have to stay at this awful airport. We were unable to sleep at the airport, naturally because they only have bolted down metal chairs. When we went back to customer service to see if there’s anything else that can be done, as far as hotel or if there was an area that had at least something that reclined but we were denied. Then in the middle of trying to discuss what we should do, an employee walked out of the back area & started carrying on a personal conversation. We waited about 10 seconds, then had to ask the representative we were talking to to get back to our conversation, the employee said “we are discussing business” and laughed. I told him that you aren’t discussing business and your customers are your business. It’s disgusting and absolutely the most pathetic thing I have seen from any airline. We had to stay awake in the airport all night or pay $200 for a hotel room. I have flown several times, this is my first and last time flying with United, and I would highly recommend going with any other airline besides United. There’s too many other airlines out there to ever put up with this again.",-1
2019-12-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to Denver,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,treated like second class citizens,False," Baltimore to Denver. On our way to the airport this morning BWI we receive a text message at 0430 saying that our flight is delayed because of a technical issue with the plane and will depart at 0700 instead of 0630 on Dec 16, 2019. At 0449 we receive a text message delayed update still addressing technical issues with plane and now departure is set for 1000. At 0637 we receive another text message that delayed update flight still addressing technical issue and departure is 1:00 p.m. At 0930 my wife went to the gate to find out what was going on. An announcement was made for people to go and get there checked bags and proceed to the ticket counter again to make other flight arrangements. At 1030 we are booked on Flight UA696 (Gate C-11 at 2:30 P.M.) from Dulles Airport so we are set from BWI to Dulles via shuttle van. Receive a text message at 1156 after we arrived at Dulles that we have a gate change from C-11 to D-12 due to gate maintenance outside. At 1156 receive a second text message that our flight is delayed due to technical issue's again from 2:30 to 4:30. At 1230 receive text message says UA696 your flights plane changed so our maintenance team could service equipment in the flight deck once the new plane arrives from the hangar, we'll prepare the cabin and board at Gate D12. At 1:08 UA696 flight from Washington to Denver is still delayed but it'll now depart at 4:10 p.m. At 2:20 your flight is delayed further and now departs at 4:25. At 2:34 receive another text delayed flight update now departs at 4:40. We didn't actually leave until after 5:00 P.M. today arriving back in Denver at 715 this evening. Not sure when this airline decided that customer service and maintenance can be done at there leisure but it's really a sad day when all you want to do after a great weekend game of Army Vs Navy is get home and you have to deal with this kind of a mess. If your not the CEO of the company then you're considered a pee-on. I surely won't recommend this airline for anyone to fly on if this is the way that good American's are treated like second class citizens.",-1

2019-12-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Toronto via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they likely wont help,False,  United Airlines was late getting into New Orleans - so we were late leaving. This put us into Houston where we had to catch a flight to Toronto - but we were late and the flight to Toronto took off early - leaving us all stranded. No help from United staff on the plane or at our gate when we got off. Everyone headed to the empty United Customer service desk. Someone showed up to try to help but the line was huge and it took hours. We called into United and got a flight for the next morning. Then another call and they got us into a motel - but refused to pay for it. They told us it was 'Weather related' so they did not have to pay. They did manage to pay for a number of other peoples hotels. There was NO Weather problems in New Orleans or in Houston. They were just late. Now we can't get ahold of them. Our travel agent gave us their website and said Good Luck - they likely wont help. Please everyone - stop using United Airlines.,-1

Not only did they delay our flight to Newark on the first day by 4 hours, they delayed our flight to Newark which had a connecting flight to Manchester by a full day! Both mechanical issues making us miss our connecting flight and fly back the next day in the evening causing a loss of earnings at work. Alongside that we finally get home after a stressful trip only to open our case a see a very well wrapped snowglobe that cost $60 smashed to pieces causing more damaged goods.

2019-12-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to San Antonio via Houston,4.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,wasn't pleasant at all,False," Got to the airport at 10:30am for my 12:40pm flight with United Airlines flight #UA6078 from Toronto to Houston then connecting to San Antonio. Checked in, boarded the plane, sat down, buckled up the whole nine. Aircraft pushed back from the gate at 12:38pm, taxied to get de-iced, because it's winter. After about 20mins and a colourful wash. Yay! I'm on my way- or so I thought. At 1:20pm I saw us heading back to the gate, bare in mind I've now been on this aircraft around 40 mins doing circles on the tarmac, no announcements made. When we finally parked at the gate, the captain came on saying the second engine would not start and they have called for maintenance and we should 'bare with them a minute' I've already bared 50 mins but who's counting. Around 1:50 or so we are told maintenance has arrived and has determined that they are unable to fix the issue and so we will have to disembark. At 2:20pm I got on the phone with United customer service, nice girl, after a 30 minute call she rebooked me on an Air Canada flight for 8:15pm to Houston, bare in mind my final destination is San Antonio. I was told there are no flights to San Antonio that they could get me on, now, I have a graduation at 9am tomorrow, so obviously I need to get there today. Out of frustration I said whatever, book the flight if that's the best you can do and I'll figure out the rest. I did this while in line waiting on the United reps to do rebooking, a line I stood in for over 2hrs. It's finally my turn, instead of being greeted with compassion and understanding, I was greeted with attitude, as if, I wrecked the engine and it was my fault the flight was cancelled or I was late for it. The agent seemed as if we were all bothering her, she wasn't pleasant at all. The only time I saw her smile was at a toddler, at least she likes kids. Though I was already booked on Air Canada, through my own doing, American Airlines had 2 flights out at 6:29pm, I asked if I could get on either flight as they both were going to Dallas then on to San Antonio, her reply was 'we don't have affiliations with American"". She said my only options were to do the whole flight tomorrow or stay over in Houston. I said absolutely not! I told her I'll keep what I have. Now, I'm super happy this engine did not fail while we were in the sky, but, there are ways to make a bad situation better and good customer service would have been one of those ways. No meal vouchers were given, nothing, no compensation in the slightest. In fact, the last apology I heard was from the captain while on the plane. I've been traveling since I was 7 years old, this was my very first time with United and I will never travel with them again! I know stuff happens, aircraft are machines and can have problems but people are not and someone who showed a bit of understanding and care for the passengers would have made all the difference today. Now at 8:06pm I am finally on AC595! Thank you Air Canada for rescuing me! Thank you United Airlines for wasting my entire day.",-1

I called the airport and spoke to a professional and concerned individual who tried to help me but was unable to help because he did not have a bag to replace mine. I was told to check in with customer service, another great staff member tried to help and gave me the number for the baggage department at my final location. The number did not work. I will never fly United again because of this. It is unfortunate because the staff were wonderful but clearly the company as a whole does not care about their customers.",-1

My adult son recently took a job in Beijing and chose United Airlines for his trip overseas. He has flown many times in the past and has a deep fear of flying. He will take medication to help calm him during any flights but it is always a struggle. On this trip there were delayed flights due to bad weather conditions in SFO. The first leg of the flight From LAX to SFO had already experienced turbulence and my son was feeling extreme anxiety and fear as he boarded the second flight. Once on board he decided he could not go through with it and went to get off. When he explained to the flight attendant why he was exiting the plane they calmly spoke with him and asked if he would like to meet the flight crew. The pilot and crew were kind enough to take the time to speak to my son about the flight, the years of experience they had and about some of the controls. They assured him he was in good hands. This crew went above and beyond by taking the time to give someone some comforting words and encouragement my son was able to take that flight and fly to Beijing to begin his new career. Much appreciation to this amazing crew!!!! I hope they know what an impact they had on someone else with their kindness and patience. Thank you to everyone at United Airlines.",1

The seats were completely worn out to the point you could feel the metal bars beneath them. The food was not worthy of a school cafeteria; it was so bad as to be inedible and unrecognizable. I honestly don't know why anyone would give United the extra money for this experience.",-1
2019-12-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Aspen,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,bait and switch situation,False,  San Diego to Aspen. Customer service is overseas they are very misleading they do not have the correct information. I called up to ask them prior to purchasing my ticket the difference between a basic ticket and an economy ticket I was told if I pay the difference for the economy ticket that includes one carry-on and one checked in luggage they checked in luggage they tell me for the basic would be $60 round-trip so instead I bought a more expensive ticket for the economy. When I went to check in I found out I didn’t pay for my luggage it was an additional $60. So I should have bought the basic ticket which in the long run would’ve save me quite a bit of money. On Southwest you get a free check in luggage and you don’t have to deal with any of this bait and switch situation. I’m very unhappy.,-1
2019-12-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Sydney,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2,Terrible experience,False,"  Our flight was cancelled on November 12th to Sydney , after sitting at the gate for over 2 hours we were to get off. We had to then line up at 2am to find hotel arrangements (which were not available and no credit or voucher was given) and to rebook our flights. After another 2 hours of waiting, we were placed on a flight the next day to Houston, to connect to a flight to Australia. With no place to sleep, or rest, we asked to go to the United Lounge, which we had to pay for! At the lounge the attendant advised, (after I voiced my concern about the timing of the next flight) that in fact the flight we were rebooked on would not give us enough time to make our connection, he advised that he could get us on an earlier flight that would allow enough time to connect. Why was this not done in the first place, I asked. No response. Once we finally arrived in Australia, our bags did not arrive with us and it then took another 2 days to receive both bags, with one of the bags being damaged as the handle was ripped off. In the meantime United was very busy charging my credit card without authorization for over $600! We have contacted them repeatedly to resolve these charges and discuss the delay the costs incurred for our accommodations that we never used, and damages, and the response we receive is that due to overwhelming emails and requests, they will only get back to us in 6-8 weeks! The service has been awful and this vacation was our lifelong dream. Terrible experience, time wasted, will never recommend anyone travel United again.!",-1

The staff forced me to check my carry-on suitcase at the boarding gate. My suitcase is 500 dollars and united broke it last time. When I told them I don't want to check the suitcase because they asked me to check my suitcase at the boarding gate last time and they broke it, the staff threatened me if I don't check my suitcase they have the right to not let me aboard. They said there is no space for my suitcase, but after I am aboard, the rack above my seat was empty. They did not clean the seat at all and there was napkin with gum in it on my seat.",-1

Had to recheck my bags to United due to a delay at Hong Kong and Cathay had booked me a new ticket from my original American Airlines. So the tags were apparently not applicable and I was required to walk outside of the building from terminal 3 to 7 which seemed like a one-mile walk when you are rushing to catch your next flight in a rain. Arrived at the check-in counters and it was so chaotic, people were confused about what to do with checking in the bags or not. Found out I had to pay $400 for two of my checked bags and then claim from AA?! And then stay in line for another 20 mins to drop the bags then another 30 mins to pass the security checkpoint. Never fly with United again.",-1

I purchased this business class ticket on Priceline for around $350, that was $50 less than on the United website, the going rate for this itinerary was around $800 on other airlines, so the deal was amazing. This aircraft on the outside looked great, on the inside was another story. Having taken a previous flight on one of United’s A320 earlier in the day, the business class seat and space in the Boeing 737-800W was and felt tight. The airplane was old and with serious signs of wear and tear in the interior. What made up was the great service provided by the crew. United is stepping up service to business class passengers. On this hour and 45 minute flight, I was served lobster mac and cheese, fresh chocolate chip cookies, the aroma in the plane was amazing. Kudos to United for the service to business class passengers at a very affordable price. I’ll be flying again soon!",1
2019-12-03,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cleveland to Chicago,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,intentionally misleading,True,"  Cleveland to Chicago. I have flown on many occasions throughout my career (first class to economy), but this one takes them all. I had attempted to check-in online with United Airlines Unsuccessfully for this very reason: I wanted to check- in two bags. The messages explained that I would have to see one of the United reps. in order to check in and no further explanation was given. I come to find out once I get to the airport and at the check-in counter that I could only check in “one” bag free of charge, but the second bag would cost $30.00. It’s not so much the money vs. how it was handled online. The online message could have simply stated that in order to check in two bags the second one would incur a fee. I would have come to the airport prepared or consolidated everything into one bag. So I ended up paying the $30 and couldn’t argue it because there was about 50 people behind me waiting. I believe the online check-in is intentionally misleading! It should simply explain that a second bag will cost money .. sure that may be mentioned in the fine print but not up front. I feel United Airlines needs to rethink their online check in policy in the way it’s communicated.",-1

Long story short, my 2.20pm flight to Dallas got delayed until 5.15pm with no direct reason. Causing me to miss my connecting flight. Then they told us that they were not flying out anymore that day and we’d have to catch another flight tomorrow. Ruined my entire trip. Now currently waiting on a return flight that was supposed to depart at 11.30am, it is now 12.15pm and again, no reason for delay! No weather issues. 2 plane delays for no reason is unacceptable. I will never fly United again.",-1
2019-12-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Philadelphia to Houston,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,seat was extremely comfortable,True,"  Philadelphia to Houston. This was my first time flying United business and I was very impressed. For this trip business class tickets were going for around $800 on all other airlines. I found this one for around $350 on Priceline. It was  $50 cheaper that booking directly with United. My first impression of the aircraft’s exterior was not good as it looked worn out however the inside looked refreshed and cleaned. The seat was extremely comfortable, spacious, and the leg room was wonderful. I was most impressed with the breakfast that was served during this 3 hour and 45 minute flight. The cold oatmeal with coconut and pineapple was outstanding! The in-flight crew was seasoned, very professional, polite, and friendly. This aircraft did not have screens on business class so make sure you download the United app on your mobile device so that you can enjoy the vast selection of entertainment offerings that they have available. Internet although I did not purchase it would have been much more cheaper than other airlines. For the price I paid for this business class trip, the service that was provided, I am a United Airlines fan and will definitely fly with them again.",1
2019-12-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,Seattle to Maui,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,totally ruined a vacation,True,  Seattle to Maui. I will never fly United again. We were to fly to Maui on November 30th with a layover in San Francisco. At 4:31 am I receive a text stating the runway at SeaTac would not allow planes to take off and that my trip to Maui had been cancelled. I go on the SeaTac website and learn there was no issue whatsoever with the runways. I contacted United and learned my plane to SFO had been used to relieve the backup caused to weather back east. I ask them what they were going to do about getting me to SFO so I could catch the flight to Maui and was told there were no other flights to SFO. The only thing I was offered was a trip flying coach the next day. Since I had paid for first class and bought the tickets eight months in advance this obviously did not go over well. I pleaded with the customer service agent to book us on another airline to SFO and again she said no flights were available - this was another LIE! The customer service worker gave me two choices of either a refund or to fly coach the next day. This has never happened to me where an airline diverts a plane and has a computer send out a sorry but your business means nothing to us text. United chose to break a commitment to get me to Maui that they had entered into 8 months prior. The fact they had backups in the east does not give an airline the right to break this commitment. If they choose to do this then they should call (not send an auto text) each person and work out something reasonable. They totally ruined a vacation I have planned for a year.,-1

Jaime and Brigitte were flight attendees on my flight and took great care of me and even asking about my family and my holidays. Truly, they both represent the  value of great customer service.

Will never travel again with this airline.,-1
2019-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to San Antonio,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly United again,False,"  If I could give 0 stars I would because my experience with United is not a good one. I flew from Cabo to Houston with United and we were stuck on the plane for 2 hours with no information on why we were not taking off until the pilot came on and said “we had to fix a mechanical issue, don’t worry these planes break down all the time and we just have to roll with it”. Then I get to Houston where I had to run to my next flight and was by Unite Stuart that hopefully our bags will make the plane , no guarantee. Then we are on the plane to Houston and yet another mechanical issue and another 45 mins sit on the plane. Then finally make it to my destination and finally find my luggage after 45 mins of waiting because they had to unload another plane before ours, I walk up to find my luggage torn apart and my makeup and straightener just thrown onto the conveyor belt. Then I walked up to the United Airlines area to talk to someone and I was dismissed and the lady was very rude to me, I told her that my luggage did not look like this before I left Houston so it happened on the way there. She stated she could give me a $100 flying pass and I told her I was never flying United again. I then begin to tell her how two pairs of my shoes were missing and I pair of sandals, she stated that I could go buy them, then bring the receipts back to the airport and get my money back, which makes no sense to me. Safe to say I will never fly United ever again.",-1
2019-12-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Dubai,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,"Worst flying experience"" ",True," Houston to Dubai. Worst flying experience I have ever had, specially on a special day, the reason I booked this trip to Dubai is to celebrate my birthday, but instead, I’m making phone calls, getting frustrated and being tossed around different departments trying to receive compensation for the lost time, delay, experience, and losing a moment of my life because this stupid flight delay ruined everything. On my Birthday to be exact, I had plans to enjoy the city and have a wonderful dinner, the fact I was already alone on my birthday. Makes it even sadder is when the cause of the airline to ruin your trip has been nothing but a nightmare to deal with because of their lack of resolution and problem solving. The expense I have to make calling internationally and being charged a night I wasn’t staying at my hotel because my flight delayed is on the head of every customer representative and management of United. I’m beyond, beyond frustrated and infuriated by this delay of handling my matter. Never fly United Airlines.",-1

Nothing annoys me more than inconsistent customer service. My parents were booked for UA1233 on November 26 but were bumped and rebooked for the following day because their flight was late getting to Denver. Which would be understandable usually. What’s not understandable is that the following evening I was on the same UA1233 flight and we were held at the gate for a half hour to allow passengers from a late flight to land and board ours. This infuriating inconsistency is one of the myriad of reasons I will not voluntarily fly United again. If I could give a zero I would.,-1
2019-11-28,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Greenville to Newark,4.0,,5.0,,,5.0,4,so kind and understanding,True,"  Greenville to Newark. United typically isn’t my preferred airline. However, today was the day before Thanksgiving. I arrived at the airport to hear my plane was delayed. I am 22 years old and live in SC where my entire family lives in NYC. Their staff went above and beyond to switch my flight and make sure I get home for thanksgiving dinner. I will forever be great full for them. They were so kind and understanding.",1
2019-11-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Kahalui,,,,,,,1,ruining a gift,True,"  Los Angeles to Kahalui booked for later this week. Thanks United for ruining a gift. Hours spent researching the best flight options. Finally decided on United because i was able to get a flight out of Burbank connecting with my Mom in San Francisco from Dallas for our Maui destination. One month before the trip i noticed in the United app both of our departing flights had been changed and i received No email. The rental and hotel was in my name and my Mom would arrive at the airport 3 hours before me stranded. In order to avoid this i now depart lax without connecting with my Mom in San Francisco for the final leg to Maui. Burbank was rated the best airport in America a few months ago and LAX was rated the worst. I was really looking forward to connecting with my Mom in San Francisco on the same flight to Maui as it's her 1st time off the mainland. Also I was really looking to departing from Burbank as I've flown out of LAX for the last 17 years. United said that they would submit for an account credit for the trouble, but when I called back 2 weeks later they said no request had been submitted. Don't fly united unless you get such a low rate your flight is almost free.",-1

We ended up flying with United after our Thomas Cook flight to JFK was cancelled following Thomas Cook’s collapse. Check in and boarding at Manchester was fine. Seats felt wider than usual. Cabin crew were very polite on both legs. I didn’t think the food was very good, (reformed turkey sandwich)and also we found that we were really very hungry towards the end of the flight And thought the snack could have come a bit earlier however it was certainly service with a smile. Delivery of the food and drinks was very efficient. What struck me was the variation in the presentation of the cabin crew. Loose hair, variations in uniform etc and not enormously smart however the crew in both legs were clearly very professional and capable. On our return flight we experience fed severe turbulence. The captain warned us a few times of what was coming and the cabin crew were reassuring passengers, being very jovial and generally making everyone feel at ease. I will definitely use United again next time I fly to New York . Entertainment was great and I found myself wishing we had another hour so I could complete the film I was watching!!",1

Good quality of service, except for the special meals we order. On Newark-Narita (2 on 3 times) and Narita-Newark flight (1 on 3 times), the flight attendants gave our meals to other passengers. At least on the return flight, an attendant came to apologize and offer Polaris meals as an alternative. United have to improve the logistics on this aspect.

I am reviewing United's policy with LatinoFare about change fees when you cancel your ticket. Unlike other airlines, United will not allow you to choose a new flight after cancellation for the same price or less. I actually found a flight $18 less, but because of United's greedy policy, LatinoFare had to go find the next most expensive flight, which added $120 to the already whopping change fee. In other words, United is greedy and unethical. I will continue to avoid traveling with United as much as possible.",-1

2019-11-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,"Batimore to Bora Bora via SFO, PPT",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3,Never again with United Airlines,True,"  Never again with United Airlines. My wife and I are returning from our “Dream Vacation” in Bora Bora (BOR); however, getting here and going home have been absolute nightmares. We started our trip on Nov 7th from BWI to SFO. Upon arriving at SFO we decided to upgrade the next (8 hour) leg of the trip to first class, and I can assume that is where the problems began. We arrived in Papeete PPT) without problem, but when we checked in for our flight from PPT to BOR the next morning, one hour before the flight, we are told we do not have tickets. The ticket agent sees that we have confirmed reservations, but says we are not ticketed. She says it appears United Airlines has “refunded” our tickets, and in order to continue on to BOR, we must buy new tickets now and work it out with UA later. With only minutes to spare before they start boarding (10 minutes before departure), we have no option but to purchase new tickets. Mind you this abbreviated version does not include my angry discussion with the Air Tahiti employees, sure they were the ones who had made the mistake, nor my wife’s plea to me to calm down. After arriving in BOR and checking into our resort I got online and sent a message to UA with all of the details I could include in 1,000 characters and pictures of the new ticket receipts, hoping to not only find some resolution, but also ensure we were good to go for our return. Days later my wife received an email confirming receipt of my correspondence, and they would reply in 7 to 14 Days. We attempted to place a wifi-call on 12 November, much to my surprise it went through. For more than two hours I tried to explain the issues to the United Airlines reservation specialist, and eventually supervisor. After the two hours had passed, I was told he could not do anything about the ticketing issues for our trip to BOR, but he assured me we were ticketed and would have no problem for our return flight, and we were emailed a new itinerary with e-ticket numbers. We are leaving BOR today, and decided to leave the comfort of our resort early to avoid a last minute rush if there was a problem with our tickets; we were booked on the last flight out for the night and didn’t have accommodations if we missed it. It came as no surprise this time to me or my wife when we stood a little longer than anyone else at the ticket desk while the agent pounded away at the keyboard, then the familiar question, “may I see your receipt or itinerary?” Seems the assurance and guarantee of the UA Reservation Supervisor that we would have no problem for our return was worthless, and I am glad we had the foresight to check in for our flight much earlier than necessary. The Chief ticket agent for Air Tahiti in BOR worked for well over an hour to try and find our tickets, with the following conclusions. United did something to take away our tickets and did not give us new ones, and the e-ticket numbers provided to us on our receipt returned “No information found.” Thus, we were forced once again to purchase tickets we have already once paid for. I asked the agents in BOR if this is a regular occurrence; the Chief agent said “with United, yes”, and her coworker shook his head in agreement.",-1
2019-11-19,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Jose via Denver,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3,this is not one of the best,True,  Orlando to San Jose via Denver. I’ve flown a couple of times so I know what’s a good airline and what’s not and this is not one of the best. First of all just to get a carry-on you have to pay extra I upgraded so I could get a carry-on plus a personal item and also they guaranteed that families would sit together because I’m flying with my two-year-old daughter. We both had a ticket and they didn’t sit us together I had to go up to the podium and they fixed it for me which was good but other airlines would’ve done it automatically without having to pay. My second complaint would be that on the connecting flight they didn’t have enough room for the carry-on bags which is really dumb since almost everybody paid for their carry-on bags they ended up letting people check them in but it’s still not fair since they charge people for the carry-on bag which other airlines don’t. Now my last complaint would be their willingness to help me get to and from my stroller with my daughter other airlines help me without me asking this airline every time I would have to wait for everybody to leave and that would receive help and would be the last one out. Their food policies were about the same you get free drinks one snack. Their attendance were a hit or miss some more sweet somewhere just straight up nasty I was confused on the flight where the bathroom was and one was very rude to me and just kept saying in the middle in the middle while I have my two-year-old in my hand. Also the look on her face told it all how she felt about me and obviously I couldn’t find it so she could’ve help me out a little more because the Plane was dark it was a early morning flight. I give 2.5 stars out of 5. I would recommend American Airlines or Southwest if you’re traveling with family,-1

However, the hold room at ORD was tight, a normal sight at US airports. Upon boarding, the airline announced that, due to the short flight (1 hour 30 minutes), there would be no meal service, even on business class. That was quite a surprise to me as I got meal service on shorter flights elsewhere. On the upside, United used a 777-200 with new, updated Polaris seats, which were quite luxurious for such a short flight. Staff were courteous and accommodating, making it a pleasant flight.",1

Had my flight changed from ROC to IAD to SEA changed to ROC to ORD to SEA. I called and talked to the Baggage Rep at Rochester and they assured me that they had gotten my change in itinerary and my bags would be following with me to ORD. I checked the United app and it verified the change in routing. When I arrived in Seattle however, the app told me my bag had actually been loaded on the flight to IAD anyway and had then been routed through Denver. They then assured me that my bag was in route and would arrive in Seattle two hours later around midnight. The tracking confirmed it was on the 12:01 am flight. The next day I checked: no bag. I checked the United App again and now it said it was just leaving Denver on yet another flight and would arrive around noon. I understand when unforeseen conditions cause delayed and rerouted flights but to be this clueless or incompetent is inexcusable. I promise two things: I will never fly United willingly again and if I am forced to fly United I will refuse to check my bags. They cannot be trusted to either handle the routing properly or failing that, honestly report the progress of their effort to correct the situation. They simply tell the customer whatever they think they want to hear and then they will do the minimum required to resolve the issue.",-1

Having never flown United before I had an open mind even after reading all the dreadful reviews. The aircraft had the best legroom I've had in economy and was comfy. Unfortunately 2 out of the 4 in flight entertainment screens were not working and travelling with kids was an issue. The crew were polite and apologetic but nothing they could do and we got a 200 dollar credit for a future flight over the next year which we will never use. Next the food which as I'm an ex airline caterer so have a lot of knowledge in this area was the worst I've ever had none of us ate it. However we arrived on time and connection to Orlando was fine. United crew on all sectors were pleasant and friendly as we came back via Houston. I wouldn't rush back to united but if the price was right I would fly them again.,-1
2019-11-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orange County to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,awful experience of lost luggage,False,"  Orange County to Chicago. I am not normally one to write reviews but because of the awful experience of lost luggage ( on a direct flight) the process of trying to get a claim completed to just talking to an actual person who cares, has been a nightmare. The representatives they connect you to, always have different answers and the process for finding luggage that was their fault for being lost in the first place is unacceptable. Between mixed messages from them saying my luggage was found and being sent to my hotel, stating they would mail a $100 travel voucher for the 3 days without luggage on my business trip to the hassle of me having to solving a problem that wasn’t my fault in the first place, makes me so upset. After filing a detailed-itemized claim, 6 weeks later someone gets to reading it and then as they continue to ‘look for your luggage’ you wait another week. All said and done after valuable time spent and hours of frustrating phone calls, they decided a minimum compensation and $400 travel voucher is acceptable. I want whoever is reading this to reconsider flying with an airline, United, that can’t make the moment right for the customer who paid for a flight well over the $400 credit given, paid to check a $30 bag that was lost and makes no attempt to go above and beyond to solve the issue.",-1

The customer service is horrendous, the incompetence of the staff is unbelievable.

I've traveled all over the world, and this was by far the worst travel experience of my life - multiple delays in all flights, eventual cancelations, forced to spend hundreds of dollars for fares and accommodations (with which UA provides no assistance), hours in lines to just be told there's nothing that can be done, filthy planes, rude staff, it goes on and on and is absolutely unbelievable and unacceptable in a first-world country. United Airlines should not be permitted to operate, they represent a shoddy customer service organization.",-1

2019-11-14,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Chicago,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,would recommend United,True,"  Excellent airline and very kind and helpful staff. We have changed 3 flights to reach our final destination. The aircraft had plenty of room for legs. Professional crew members took great care about us. They have helped passengers to change seats in order to have more space for a comfortable flight, this is very important especially on long flights. What I've liked the most is that the gate for our next flight for Europe was very close to the gate where we have arrived in Chicago. That was very convenient. It spared us time running through the Chicago airport. I would recommend United because I don't have any complaints at all.",1

United customer service took me 4 hours by phone talking with them, no solutions. So, my mom was stuck in Bogota Airport and thanks to the work of Avianca they resolved the big problem of United and buying a new ticket for her. I will avoid to travel with United again.",-1

I walked up to the boarding desk and told them my issue . They said that it was a full flight and they couldn't do anything about it. I couldn't take that for and answer. How can you expect me to sit so far away from my 10 year old son for 16 hours. I kept at it trying to get them to let me sit by him. They wouldn't let me . Can you believe this. The lady at the counter interrupted me while I was talking and said ""lady we told you to wait no please be quiet and wait "". I had had it. I canceled that flight and immediately changed to a different airline, this time I was flying Singapore Airlines. To my dismay we were again seated away from each other so I end to the desk at told them. They said ""this is a full flight but we will change your seats one way or another ."" They were so kind and loving. I got to sit with my son no problem. In conclusion United Airlines is a horrible airline. Never fly with them.",-1
2019-11-13,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Chicago to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,United has been terrible,False," Chicago to San Francisco. I consistently have bad customer experience with United. I recently changed my first and last name. I needed to update an existing ticket and was told the only way to do so was to update my mileage plus account information. After submitting a marriage certificate and court approved name change documentation, I was able to update my account. When I went to change my ticket, I was told this was impossible to do. They asked me why I would book it under the wrong name in the first place. There are legitimate reasons people may change their first name (they go by a different name, they are transitioning, legal or safety reasons) and United has made it incredibly difficult to respect these changes. Furthermore, it's not really United's business why I would need to change my first name, as long as I have submitted the proper documentation. I was able to change the name on my ticket with American Airlines with no difficulty, but this entire process with United has been terrible. Not only is the customer experience on the aircrafts substandard, but their back of office is also unhelpful. I do not recommend United to anyone.",-1

2019-11-11,0.3,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Aruba to Newark,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,wheelchair was not available,False,  Very disappointed upon our arrival at Newark. This was the third time upon my arrival to Newark from Aruba a wheelchair was not available and I had to wait for the entire plane to deboard and still no wheelchair only after my husband went searching for one and found one did someone come with a wheelchair. A supervisor made excuses they were short staffed. When the wheelchair pusher tried to apologize he told her don’t apologize. We arrived at baggage and had wait for over an hour to get our bags along with 40 others 20 being business class. Only after many inquiries were we given any information. We pay full price for business class expecting decent service which we did not receive. It’s a shame you care so little about someone who genuinely needs a wheelchair. I think it’s time to consider a different airline.,-1

",False,  I am a little late in completing this review - I flew from Dallas/Ft. Worth to San Francisco on 10/5 Flight #UA324 - United Airlines. The stewardesses were the most fun group. I feel like I had met best friends with them! They kept the flight enjoyable - had everyone laughing! A lot of people are nervous when flying but they put everyone at ease. I am not nervous to fly but it was truly refreshing to have such friendly stewardesses. I truly hope in my future travels that I am lucky enough to be on a flight with the.,1

You have horrific customer service and have done nothing to rectify my situation. I am irate. I never want to fly United again. This is the worst flight experience of my life. There was no effort on behalf of United staff to rectify my situation. The staff at Newark International Airport were the worst I have ever encountered.

On the 6th November we had booked a flight by Lufthansa from Denver to Amsterdam. They had a massive strike and they booked us to a flight 24 hours later at United Airlines. That was a big disappointment because of the long wait. We went to the United desk F (in Denver) and we spoke to the staff there. Because of our children, we asked her to look at the possibility of an earlier flight. She did more than her best to help us and because of her effort, we could step info a flight 1.5 hour later! The flight was perfect! The Seats were great! Thank you - you made our day.",1

I asked for a partial refund for the inconvenience that this delay caused in my residency interview schedule, which apparently to United means completely cancelling my connecting flight and not telling me until i’m on the airplane, have to be pulled off and reinstated as a passenger. Basically the person from customer service on the phone I spoke with thought I wanted to cancel my connecting flight and get a refund (no such words ever came out of my mouth and I wouldn’t ask for my flight to be cancelled and then wait in the airport for 4 hours at night instead of going home). The gate clerk blamed me and said it was somehow my fault for even calling United customer service in the first place. The representative on the phone was not clear about her intentions and did not explain what she was doing, and she also had an extremely hard time speaking English. Very dissatisfied.",-1

I’ve flown dozens of times; this one I was most worried about because I brought my 1 year old son. At the gate, TSA agents helped me by putting my husband next to me. While it’s common we are first to board, they helped us collapse our stroller. All the flight attendants were really nice to us. Always making sure we had plenty of snacks and milk. My son seemed a handful but the lady flight attendants were very understanding and always there to help. Very cheerful. The seats had tv screens and they offered free headphones! We watched the new Lion King movie that just came out. The whole experience was above and beyond any flight I’ve ever been on. The WiFi was really slow, but the TV made up for that. Thanks for upping your game, United.",1

Three days before my flight, my wife fell off a ladder and ended up in the hospital with surgery scheduled. I cancelled my flight and the lady on the phone kept suggesting that I rebook instead of cancelling. I explained what happened and the trip was to attend a convention she directed me to a web site to seek a refund. I filled in a single page questionnaire explaining why I cancelled. In less than 24 hours I got an email wishing my wife a speedy recovery followed by receipts issuing 100% refund of baggage and airfare back to my card. Thank you United.",1

So, the flight from Oklahoma City to Houston was great! Then it went to pot! We were given our boarding pass for gate C10, 20 minutes before flight I went to attendant and was informed that flight had been changed to gate E16. So we rush to new gate and found out we were to late. There was no announcement that the gate had been changed. There were 14 people who missed the flight besides us. We have flown on United Airlines 2 times in the last year, both times we were in first class, and both times the airline was disorganized. The first time we flew 1st class, we were bumped from 1st class because 2 air marshalls were catching a ride. We paid $400 extra per ticket over the coach amount and got a voucher for $200/ticket. Then when we tried to use voucher, we were told it couldn't be used on a first class fare. Now that makes no sense at all. I would not recommend flying United Airlines! Absolute ripoff, greedy corporate run business.",-1

2019-11-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Orleans to Los Angeles via Houston,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,customer service is shockingly bad,True,"  United Airlines customer service is shockingly bad, belittling to the customer and rude. My partner and I travelled from New Orleans to Houston to LA to Auckland to Brisbane. We booked our flights though Air New Zealand (amazing airline) but unfortunately our flights from New Orleans to Houston and Houston to LA were operated by United. United needs to do much better when dealing with customers who book though another airline but have a connecting flight with United. First of all there was no online check in for our flights. I feel that much of this could have been avoided had we been able to check in online 24 hours before our flight. When we arrived at the airport to check in, the United check in computers wouldn’t recognise our confirmation number, even after a United staff doubled check and entered it herself, the computers said that it was with a different airlines and we would have to check in with them. Somehow the United attendant was able to override it since she could see on her computer that we were booked on the United flight. Then it came to check our bags. On our electronic tickets it says that each person is allowed two bags on each flight. It also has the air New Zealand baggage policy that says 2 bags per person on each flight no matter who the carrier is. My partner and I each had two checked bags. When the United attendant asked how many bags to check, I said two each. She said that since our first flight is operated by United, United baggage rules apply which means we are only allowed one checked bag each and that to check a second bag will be $159USD for each bag. Even though United and Air New Zealand has a partnership agreement that allows us to travel, the United attendant was adamant and blunt saying that the baggage allowance that is on our booking confirmation and tickets does not apply, she wouldn’t even look at the information we had. She made us feel as if we were lying to try to get out of paying baggage fees. She was very rude, even calling on other United staff to back her up and showing us a computer screen that has the United baggage policy of one checked bag per person. Luckily we had our phone and enough time before our flight to phone Air New Zealand customer service. They looked at our booking and said that we are allowed two checked bags each for free and we’re not sure why United was not honouring their partnership agreement with Air New Zealand. The air New Zealand customer service lady was so understanding and said that we should not have to deal with this disagreement and for us to pay the $159USD x 2 baggage fees and they’ll reimburse us.",-1

I was scheduled to arrive in Austin on Nov. 8, and flying home to St. Louis on the 10th. I was travelling to Austin to visit a cousin who has cancer. My cousin has entered hospice and moved to Houston to live with a family member. My Nov. 10 flight was leaving Austin, going to Houston, and then continuing on to St. Louis. I called the airline and asked if I could pick up my flight in Houston instead of Austin, and explained the situation, including offering to provide documentation of my cousin's condition and relocation from his physician. I was told I would not be allowed to board the flight in Houston, because that would be a direct flight instead of the connecting flight I paid for. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told the same thing. I can see why United has such a poor reputation. I will not be flying with them in the future.",-1

Then I find a completely different flight booked on my account that I did not book to Chicago for the same day as my trip to Albany. Upgraded seat was terrible, no drinks as in other airlines, no power, no screen, no USB. Upgrade for missed flight not refunded. Staff was not helpful in plane guy wouldn't help with my bag in the back which caused me further delays since I was seated up front. Credit card machine not working when trying to make a purchase. No chat support on airline web page. Never got notice of delay using app or email, found out at gate. I can't have carbs so I couldnt eat anything on this 3 hour flight.

The staff that answered barely understood English, kept telling me that the only option they had was a flight that pushed my timeline of flying for the day from 6 hours to 13 hours through airports. They offered no reimbursements for any of my associated costs to this, and here I am, still awaiting a connecting flight. Horrid customer service at the gate as well, as they took roughly 20 minutes per customer with upwards of 80 people in line. They only had two agents working on the desk as well. This caused most people to walk away to go to another desk or call. I will be changing the airline I frequent from United immediately following this trip.",-1

Every single time I end up flying with United I end up extremely disappointed. They have tickets that do not include a carry on. I paid $580 for a ticket and they charged me $60 to check a carry on bag. Last time I flew with them, they ripped the handles completely off of my bag. So to say I did everything in my power to not fly with them would be an understatement. To get to the airport and find out I have to check my tiny carry on bag was not good news at 4 am.

Flight delay almost 3 hours due to mechanical issues on outbound flight from DIA which resulted in loosing half a day in Denver area! Why would United not book us on the next available flight when there were still seats available? Why don't they have another plane available? Denver is a main hub and this is ridiculous when it's from the originating airport. United has offered no compensations.,-1

I really cannot think of anything good to say about them. Today is the third time in a row they have both been delayed by an hour or more, and forced me to check my bag, even though when I get on board, there is plenty of bin space available costing me 30 minutes on the other end of my flight, on top of the delays. Do they really have so little comprehension of bin space or communication between on plane and terminal staff? I don't have this problem with Southwest, Virgin, Delta, Alaska, just United. Honestly if I had a choice, I would use any other airline. So I guess routes is the other thing we have to give them credit for.",-1

I was a little put out and she recognized that but couldn’t help. We left and waited to board. My wife went ahead of me and I waited till last to board. When I got up to board she handed me a different boarding pass and kindly said here you go Mr Kopsho. I was presently surprised she remembered and took the time to fix a little problem in our travels. My wife was very surprised. We had a great flight thanks to a very considerate team member.

United has by far the worst customer service of any airline I have encountered. I had issues with a cancelled flight for an international trip and was trying to re-book my connecting flight and they wanted to charge me over 200 dollars in change fees which is less than it would have cost to buy a brand new ticket. The customer service on the phone is atrocious and no one was helpful and everyone was rude and inefficient.

A $50 voucher after almost 6hrs delay and a small snack whether you fly east or west. A so-called apologize letter from their president. Then the next week, the same delay happens again, you can’t believe how terrible UA is doing right now. They don’t tell you the truth instead only telling you time by time that your flight is impacted by an earlier departure. Will not take UA if I have other options in the future! They never really care as they have the unions to protect themselves but trust me in the way how they manage, they will disappear one day eventually.",-1

United Airlines staff in Aguadilla Puerto Rico are extremely unprofessional. Just because I purchased an economy flight it doesn’t give staff the right to talk down to the customer. At the end of the day, they all have jobs because of us the travelers. Training is extremely needed throughout the entire airline especially in Aguadilla! Learn to treat customers with respect and not as if they are idiots. Never traveling United Airlines again.",-1

My husband and I tried to check in on line without success, the message told us to do this at Ohare. The flight was to depart at 10 am, I received a text stating a delay and the new time was 10:25 am. We were looking for assistance at 9:15 am at the airport but the person helping couldn't check us in stating we got there too late. She sent us to additional services where the same happened. They told us the doors for boarding closed at 9:50 am. We had no bags to check and security was light. They still wouldn't let us through. Just then we got another text asking us the check in. We showed the text and asked what was the problem, why were they holding us back? They offered to put us on a flight for 10/22, I stated there would be high winds tomorrow and it would probably cause more trouble. I asked for our money back but they wouldn't do anymore for us than rescheduling for the next day. We went back home which is an hour and a half away from Ohare. We learned the flight didn't leave till 11:30 which was an hour and a half later. Not happy with United. They have you by the throat once they have your money.",-1
2019-10-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Denver via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,got me into the next flight,True,"  Columbus to Denver via Chicago. I leave my apartment at 330p, slight traffic but get to airport at 345. Some issues finding parking so I eventually get out and make it to the United desk at 400. Flight departs at 440. I tried to check in via mobile but United won't let basic economy check in unless you check a bag for $30. So I get to the desk and try to check in via the kiosk but it said the same thing. I then ask the gate agent to check me in who noticed that I had a book bag and carry on and said I could only have 1 item. So I spend a few minutes stuffing my book bag into my regular bag, then the agent tries to check me in again and by this time it is 410p, the agent was locked out of checking me in 30 minutes before departure time. I was truly in disbelief. There was nothing anyone could do to get me my boarding pass. The gate agent then tries to get me on the earliest available way to get to Denver which would have been 930pm Denver time. unfortunately the flight to Chicago from Columbus was already delayed so I wouldn't have time to make my connecting flight. Eventually they got me into the next flight and now I won't be getting into Denver until 1047 pm Denver time. This airline tries to do whatever it can to get more money out of you and doesn’t care about passenger experience or customer service. Unfortunately this terrible airline has a monopoly on certain routes so in some cases is the only option. Will only fly if there is truly no other option.",-1

I had checked in via the United web site and got my boarding pass etc. I got to the airport four hours early so I could request an isle seat.

All the fee and add ons they have, I wish they just make their tickets a bit higher priced, than to make it feel “cheap” when you actually board.

Trying to fly out of Denver and they cancelled the flight because of high winds? This is Denver - I’m outside now and the winds are fairly normal. Of course they tell me they can’t rebook me until tomorrow as all flights are full. So I sit and watch as they unload our luggage off the plane and reload another flights on the same plane.  Checked the board and there are about 10 out of 300 on board cancelled. They are cancelling low profit flights so they can get planes for high profit flight.,-1

This is my first time flying with United Airlines, and unfortunately it will be my last. I had a flight leaving Houston going to St Louis at 9:45am. I received a call from my mother saying my grandpa had a heart attack. There was a flight leaving at 7:45, I went to the customer service desk to try to catch the earlier flight. There was a rude woman at the desk. I asked her about switching the flight and she was very insensitive to my situation. Said she couldn’t switch the flight and started to ignore me.  I will never fly with this airline again. Customer service is horrible.",-1

My family’s weekend trip to RAP for a fellow service members and dear friend’s funeral is ruined. It’s already tough enough traveling on a plane with a 2 year old, but now we have to do it for an additional day. So after paying $1300 for airline tickets to get us to our destination we currently stand as such: -Stuck in a Denver hotel with no crib and requiring food delivery because there’s nothing close and our car seat is with our luggage -missing the funeral that we bought these tickets for -$150 of united Monopoly money in my pocket - not at our destination We couldn’t be more displeased. We really had to scrape together this money to honor our fallen friend and service member and now we spent that money for nothing. We will definitely recommend not to use United to a friend.",-1

2019-10-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cedar Rapids to Bozeman,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,pay extra to not fly with United,True,"  Cedar Rapids to Bozeman. Horrible experience. I will pay extra for another airline. Flight in the morning scheduled to leave at 6am. Told us delay due to a leak. Came back on, told us closest mechanic is 30 min away. Told us numerous times on pa she had our backs and was working on rerouting people in order of their connecting flights. Said it was an automated system and again she had our backs. Then told us the mechanic had to go get tools ... wouldn't you think he'd come with tools? Told us the first connecting flight was 9:45 and everyone should make connections. My flight was to leave at 9:00 out of Denver. Then they had to get parts and delayed 2 hours but she had our backs. I went up and talked with another attendant. No one had our backs. She said it's not automated. She helped get us on stand by for a connection and then a late flight for sure leaving at 6:30 pm from Denver. As I'm standing there the flight was cancelled. Glad I happened to be standing there so she booked me on a later flight leaving Cedar Rapids at 3:30. I'm really glad I did not have to deal with the lady that had our backs with her automated non-existing system and did nothing for us. Came back to airport, flight delayed an hour. Got to Denver and gate was B21. Went and ate, came back and they changed the gate to B44, right by where we ate. Walked back to B44 and flight is delayed by half an hour. There is an Oregon flight that has to leave before our plane can get in. That plane just pulled up. No way we are getting out of here half hour late, it will be an hour at least. Felt lied to this morning and over promising and under delivering seems to be a pattern with this company. Flew on them last January too and ended up having to get a rental car to get home. Their Customer service agent showed such indifference to our situation. Given these experiences, I will gladly pay extra to not fly with United.",-1

Flight check in had an issue printing our baggage tags. We were then offloaded despite: 1) That it was their system that had an issue 2) The flight had been moved earlier without any notice Station manager at Flagstaff proceeded to blame us for not being ready 3 hours before despite all communication from the airline saying we only had to be ready 1 hour before. Spent 2.5 hours on the helpline because the Station Manager said there was nothing else they could do. Awful. American Airlines (which had a counter next to them) actually did more to assist us to get to Toronto that United did. Wouldn't ever fly them.,-1

As our tickets said “see agent” we went to go see our assigned seats also seeing if we can see if we can get some of our family put together. There is 7 of us as again it was for a funeral. As we tried to voice our frustrations to having to pay extra to sit together as a family, the lady working the E1 gate at 6pm on October 14th wasn’t the friendliest as we tried to voice our frustration. Not trying to be aggressive. As we walk away she says “I shouldn’t of even tried to get them together” again super disappointed on how this situation was handled. United will be the last resort to fly as they aren’t very accommodating unless you push. Sad that flying in the last several years has resulted to this.",-1
2019-10-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,A horrible experience,True,"  San Francisco to Newark. Due to aircraft change, my friend and I were downgraded from 1st class to Economy on this leg of our Business class flight from Australia code sharing with Air New Zealand. We were appalled when given a voucher by way of compensation with so many restrictions attached as to be practically useless to Australian citizens. Beware of using any airline offering a codeshare flight on United Airlines. The substituted aircraft was dirty, smelly and delapidated with a torch hanging from the ceiling in the toilet for illumination. The battery gave out 2 hours into the flight so customers had to use their mobile phones to see and the state of the toilet attested to the fact that this method was inadequate in the extreme. A horrible experience made worse by the inadequate (if not illegal) compensation.",-1

I had the Basic Economy flight from LGA to Houston and then, connected to Austin. This class of service means you can’t check in online ahead, however when you arrive at the gate, you have unfriendly staff trying to get you to pay for your hand luggage continuously until you board the plane. My seat assignment was the last row against the toilet so no reclining. United basic economy awful and I hope the other airlines don’t follow this “class” of a bad idea! The customer service for this class of fares makes the airline undesirable. I won’t fly United again unless it’s a last resort.",-1

I travel cross country at least twice per month with Southwest or JetBlue. I tried United Airlines on the last trip. Never again. The plane was unkempt, the Internet was spotty at best.

There was delay of 1,5 hours due to cleaning purposes. When Flying back to Amsterdam there was also a delay of 2 hours due to cleaning purposes. Is this just common policy, or is United Airlines (UA) inaccurately informing its customers? Seems like UA needs to improve its logistics .. on board though everything was splendid.",-1
2019-10-12,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Mumbai via Newark,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4,Boeing 787 cabin felt quieter,True,"  Los Angeles to Mumbai via Newark. United's Boeing 787-10 is the best aircraft I have flown on a domestic route within US. My connecting flight from Newark to Mumbai was on a B777-300ER and it felt like a downgrade from B787-10. The three main differences that I experienced were:  B777-300ER had a dense 3-4-3 seating configuration with seats that felt uncomfortably narrow. Boeing 787-10 had a more responsive IFE than B777-300ER. Boeing 787 cabin felt quieter than B777-300ER. The food and service from Newark to Mumbai were outstanding, but it was quite the opposite on the return flight from Mumbai. The midflight snack was a bun with aaloo tikki inside. This would have been a delicious snack, but United served it cold instead of warming it up! Accompanying the sandwich was Parle-G biscuits. United's midflight offerings were a stark contrast to what's offered on other airlines like Emirates, Swiss, & Virgin Atlantic. On a positive note, I was impressed by United's baggage handling in Newark. Not only did United transfer my bags in a tight schedule, but I was able to track my bags on the United app.",1

2019-10-10,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Puerto Vallarta to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,no wheel chairs waiting for us,True,"  Puerto Vallarta to Houston. I am fully disabled, my wife has very bad knees. We requested wheel chairs as we can not walk far. When in Puerto Vallarta they had wheel chairs ready for us at front entrance into airport. When we landed in Houston there no wheel chairs waiting for us or any other Handicap people on plain. There were about 30 of us from our plain and others that were herded like cattle about 150 yds to a large elevator that is used for equipment. It took us down to the basement were we were left trying fine seats to sit in as there was enough. Me and my wife had to stand for 10 minutes before I found an abandoned cart for to sit on. They were coming every 15 min and take a few people away but they would not tell us what was going on. I asked one of the united people they just said they would get to us. In the mean time I am watching of these people who had wheel play games with each other for over 20 min. And never attempting to help the people needing wheel chair assistance. I decided me and my wife would go back up stairs for help as the seats were very uncomfortable. When we got up stairs and looking to find our way we talked to different airline staff for help with wheel chairs. Both times we waited for 15 mins. No one showed up. We then stopped and talked a man driving a cart who could barely speak English he said he could not help. We ended going through security waiting in line with everyone else and watching people in wheel chairs from other airlines being helped. we ended walking all the way to the train from concourse E. When we got of train at concourse B I seen 2 young men from united with 2 empty wheel chairs. I stopped them told them what was going on. They had people to help but they called and got permission to help to our concourse. The only way we can change the problems in big business is to have large group stop using them. When it starts hurting your pocket book United maybe you will show a little compassion.",-1

United repeatedly forces me to check my carry on bag even though I paid for Economy instead of Basic Economy. They claim that all overhead bins are completely full, yet when I board the plane there is tons of empty space in the overheads. There is clearly no communication between the gate agents who arbitrarily decide when to force people to check bags and the actual space left on the plane. Additionally, there would never even be a problem with overhead space if the flight attendants actually monitored people who put small backpacks in the overhead space instead of under their seat. I specifically do not check a bag because I don’t want to deal with the at least 30 extra minutes to retrieve my luggage from baggage claim. This is a repeated problem and is extremely frustrating to have to wait at baggage claim after a long day of traveling in the cramped United seats.",-1

Airline representative forced me to check in my carry on even though it met the personal bag size requirement. The fact that it had rollers they forced me to check in personal item and eat up the cost. They tried to rationalize by saying its only $30 dollars. But I can say the same thing to the airline, it’s only $30 dollars and they are providing me with a terrible customer experience and causing a hold up that made me almost missed my flight. Unless this problem gets resolved, it is highly unlikely I will fly with United in the future.",-1

After United told me I can’t make my direct flight because I had a back pack and didn’t pay for that, which I offered to, I now have to take layovers and miss my ride at my final destination. This refusal to give me the ticket I paid for because I have a carry on now leave a disabled veteran and his wife sleeping at the airport all night. Horrible idea United.",-1

United Airlines has to be one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. They do not care one bit about their customers. They changed my seat assignments for no reason. Was originally sitting with a free seat and moved me. I also paid extra for economy plus. They moved me to a seat before the exit row which didn’t recline. When I called they told me that when you book your flight it tells you that the seat does not recline in the exit row or before and told me you should look carefully next time. Meanwhile, that was not the seat I originally picked but they put me there without my knowledge and when I inquired about it they had told me the flight was full and couldn’t do anything about it. There was no TV on that plane so I purchased the internet for $49 and that didn’t work either and I was told there was nothing they can do. Fifty dollars out the door. What a miserable flight. These people do not care at all. I would never fly United again. That’s what I get for not flying my usual airline. United sucks",-1

2019-10-04,0.7,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Lima via Houston,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,5,Recommended for the price,True,"  I was initially hesitant about booking the flight on United after all the negative media coverage about the airline. However, these fears were very much put to rest. I paid US$825, all-in including taxes, for a round trip journey of 3 legs in each way. HKG-NRT-IAH-LIM & back (ANA codeshare HKG-NRT). Incredible pricing. Despite the aircraft (B767 & B777) being of some age, the widebodies meant that overhead baggage bins were generally sufficient. The planes were also fitted with  up-to-date IFE (with a huge selection of the latest movies, no lagging or dead screens), and USB & laptop charging ports. The legroom in economy wasn't the best, but manageable. Recline could be better. (I'm 5""11 or 1.81m and I reckon anyone taller would require their Economy PLUS option), seats were fairly comfortable and I had no problems sleeping 6-7 hours at a go on the 12hr flight and this is in economy. FA service was reasonably hospitable ... but I boarded with low expectations though. Even though we missed our connecting flight due to the flight arriving 3hrs late, the ground staff at Houston  was superb and had no hesitation arranging for us to be on the next flight (with a slight upgrade too), and preparing our confirmation of travel delay for insurance claim purposes. On top of that, he put us up in a decent hotel for the night and provided an $80 meal voucher as well. That turned the initially bad experience into a very decent one. It is also worth noting that the checked baggage arrived with no incident. What was lacking, however was: 1) Barely satisfactory selection of food. Meals were not tasty and very bland. 2) Aisle width was very narrow and the FAs and other passengers kept bumping into me even though I was well within my seat and not spilling out. Overall, it's hard to complain at such a price point. Recommended for the price -sensitive leisure traveller.",1
2019-10-03,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Burbank to San Francisco,4.0,,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,service at front desk terrible,True," Burbank to San Francisco. A family member bought my flight and I ended up on United Airlines for my return flight home. Couldn't have a carry-on, no disability veteran discount only active duty. In order to update flight, I had to pay a 100$ to cancel before I could even pay to upgrade. Hello upcharge! Needless to say, I didn't upgrade anything. So 30$ to check my carry-on bag haven't had to do that anywhere else. First time flying with United also the last. Customer service at front desk terrible just an unpleasant experience. The plane is nice, the crew are nice, which is the reason I didn't give them a complete failure rating but the damage is done. The flight was not even full so don't see the reason why me upgrading was such an issue. I was willing to pay but not 100$ on top of the upgrade fee so I could at least have my bag with me. Partly my fault for not going with my normal airline and not getting the ticket myself. Live and learn! United Airlines does not seem to be disabled veteran friendly.",-1
2019-10-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Vancouver via Chicago,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,never fails to be absolutely awful,True,"  United never fails to be absolutely awful. Several years ago, I flew United from Columbus, OH to London. I flew out of Columbus to Chicago. Right as I was about to board the plane to Chicago, we got delayed.... four hours because of a problem with engine. By the time I got to Chicago, I missed my connection to London. United put me in a hotel for the night in a hotel where the AC was broke and it was the end of June. The next morning I had to fly from Chicago to DC to take another connection. That flight went fine. But my flight from DC to London got delayed because of an issue with navigation. Navigation! We’re flying across the Atlantic Ocean and there’s a navigation problem?! By the time I got in to London all transportation had shut down and I had to take a night bus to a stop near my hotel and then walk three miles to my hotel in the middle of the night in London. Good news! United forgot my bags in the United States! So at least if I had been robbed I would have had nothing to give them. The next day our bags were supposed to arrive. We waited and waited until we finally figured out they had been delivered to the wrong hotel. I mean can it get an worse?? I emailed United and did I get any voucher or anything from them for all of this? Nope! Just a quick “sorry”. I swore I would never fly United again. Now flash forward to 2019. My mom did not know if my boycott of United and she booked a flight for a family vacation from Columbus, OH to Vancouver, CA. I did not know she booked United until after she booked it. I get on the plane and I was surprised how nice everyone was. I’m thinking, “ok maybe I was wrong all along”. Leave the gate, and as I’m writing this review I will miss my connection from Chicago to Vancouver bc I have been sitting on this airplane on the tarmac because it is delayed! Literally amazing. This is such a terrible airline! In addition to all the plane issues I have had, this week a United passenger took a video of an engine violently vibrating on the wing of one of the planes makes me Columbus to Vancouver via Chicago.

Here’s my complaint: Was booked for a flight out of South Bend at 0600 (UA5330) and Chicago at 0753 (UA4289) as per confirmation. No info for pre-check-in sent. Upon arrival at SB airport, learned there was no record of me on 0600 flight (which they switched me to) and UA4289 out of Chicago didn’t even exist. Customer service agent at United customer service booth was rude and unhelpful, not allowing me to finish a single sentence and then telling me I haven’t given him proper information. I now have over 6 hours to wait in Chicago, departing 2 hours after I was supposed to land in Winnipeg, no longer have a ride home and will need to work on making other arrangements from long distance, and will be missing an important specialist appointment this afternoon. 1. I want to know how I can be given a confirmation for a flight that doesn’t even exist? 2. Customer service experience in South Bend and Chicago were horrible, your staff need retraining on how to listen and speak to customers. Make sure not to count on the information on your confirmation with this airline - it doesn’t mean boo. Don’t make plans around flights with this company as you may not even be in the same country when you’re due. If you do, make sure to contact them to make sure the flights you’re confirmed for actually exist, and that you’re actually booked on them. Feel free to share with others who fly with United so they don’t get screwed over the way I have. Horrible company, horrible experience.",-1
2019-10-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Melbourne via Washington and Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,wasted two days in transit on this trip,False,"  I flew my parents from Canada to Australia for the birth of my child. Their flight from Washington to LA was delayed and due to land when their flight to Melbourne, Australia was meant to depart. Staff assured my parents that they were going to delay the Australia flight briefly to get the delayed passengers on. My parents explained their situation and were assured they would be let off first and brought to their flight. None of this happened. They were booked on the flight the following day which got them to Australia at the same time as my scheduled c-section. Needless to say, my OB had to push back the birth of my child due to United Airlines. To make matters worse, UA has now cancelled my parents flight from Washington to Ottawa and rebooked them for almost 24 hours later. They have now wasted two days in transit on this trip when the flights are already 27 hours. Ridiculous.",-1

We had to stop in Boston for 3 hours to pick up an employee of United Airlines. So the flight from London to New York was almost 10 hours. United is unreliable. Good food but bad service from the staff. Definitely not flying again with United.,-1
2019-10-02,0.8,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Punta Cana,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,3.0,4,plenty of legroom and seat space,False,"  The flight from Newark to Punta Cana was the best out of the two-way trip.

Snacks and drinks were good and complimentary",1
2019-10-02,0.8,Solo Leisure,First Class,San Francisco to Newark,5.0,,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,definitely fly again,False," Red eye from San Francisco to Newark. Was dreading the flight after reading all the terrible reviews. My flight was very good, however. Check in swift and easy, lounge spacious and comfortable, boarding on time and take off early. Yes, 8 abreast in ""First"" is a squeeze, but my window seat was very comfortable and slept well for almost the whole flight. If traveling with a partner then the relative lack of privacy isn‘t an issue (no privacy screen between seats). Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Entertainment offering was fine. can‘t comment on the catering as I slept through it all. Would definitely fly again, especially considering the reasonable fare.",1
2019-09-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to San Francisco,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,bait and switch,False," Sept. 10, 2019, 9am was our scheduled flight from Nashville to San Francisco. We had been told prior that there were runway repairs scheduled in San Francisco that could lead to delays of 45 minutes to 2 hours. Since we were driving to Nashville from Knoxville because we got a non-stop flight, we figured any delay wouldn't exceed the time lost if we switched to another flight that required making connections. The delay turned out to be 5 hours though. One hour at a time they over and over. There was not a weather issue, yet this is the text I received ""Delay update: Your 9:00am flight from Nashville to San Francisco is delayed further because air traffic control reduced the number of planes allowed to land each hour until weather conditions and/or air traffic improves. UA2167 now departs at 1:40pm on September 10."" We hoped that our return flight would go better - it was worse! Return flight on 9/16/19 was ""Canceled: Your flight UA2060 from San Francisco to Nashville is canceled because your plane needs repairs"". They then put us on another flight, going to Chicago and a connection to get to Nashville. We had 10 minutes to get to our connection in a separate building in Chicago, if that flight had closed the doors on schedule we would have missed it. Instead of arriving in Nashville at 5:15am as scheduled, with the changes we arrived nearly 5 hours later than planned, resulting in issues for us for our transport back to Knoxville. We had booked with United against our better judgment, but the direct flight idea won, and as it turned out that isn't even what we got! All 3 flights had issues with something, one where the computer was down, two where the wifi did not work, a bathroom door that was sticking. We met others who were enduring delays and cancellations on other flights. When we arrived in Nashville and were walking through the gate, there were folks at two other gates who were enduring delays, the same flight we had taken exactly a week before was already delayed 4 hours. While waiting in the airport on our return, we met a gentleman who had booked a direct flight from Newark to Oakland, only to end up with 2 connections that he missed and after 15 hours of trying to get to his destination, he was stuck in the San Francisco airport waiting for another connection to get him to Oakland. ""Direct flight"" = bait and switch. We will never fly United again!",-1

I have tickets on this flight I paid for. Sitting in row 11 and went forward to use the lavatory since there were people waiting to get in the one in the rear of the plane.

I understand when flying basic economy that you can not have a carry on but for the customer service representative to allow us to take it with us and then call us out and tell us we have to pay $55 dollars to check it in was very unprofessional. To check in a bag is $30 and he told us he was waiving $20. That’s not the right way for a company so big to have their employees treat customers that way and tell them they are in the wrong.,-1
2019-09-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no seatback entertainment,False," Honolulu to Houston. United Airlines has the worst customer service and cabin quality in the industry. First of all, we find it completely unacceptable that on a 7h flight from Hawaii to Houston there were no seatback entertainment and power outlets. Moreover, the temperature in the cabin was like in Alaska. After asking the cabin crew several times for adjusting the temperature they did nothing.",-1

Staff at Denver airport extremely helpful and friendly. My partner and I were concerned at first because we were flying basic economy and did not have a seat number assigned to us on our United app boarding pass. We asked if we indeed had seats and she confirmed that we did though they were on separate ends of the plane. We were just thrilled to have seats and to be getting home on time. After a while, she came up to us with two new boarding passes that seated us side by side. Staff truly went the extra mile.",1

We started our outbound flight with a delay of 1 hour on the 30th August and had return flight on the 14th september from LAX to Amsterdam with a transfer in Chicago. The morning of our flight on the 14th we got a text because there was a delay. We went to the airport and UA rescheduled our flight from LAX to Amsterdam with a transfer in San Francisco. But both flights had a delay, the first one from Lax to San Francisco was 40 minutes delayed and the one from San Francisco to Amsterdam 3,5 hours delayed! We are working on a refund but United Airlines are not responding on any of my e-mail! I will never fly again with United Airlines.",-1
2019-09-28,0.8,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to Cleveland,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,charge an acceptable exchange rate,True,"  I have been a United Mileage Plus member for several years, and was even a Platinum member last year, and Gold this year, but last night I almost tore up my membership card. I booked a couple tickets for my wife and I to Belize and I did my search and pricing for this trip in USD and the total came to $1020.32, but when I went to purchase it with my Canadian credit card it converted it to $1,617.02 CDN. That is a 1.58% exchange rate. That is totally outrageous considering the official exchange rate today is 1.36%. The cost should have been closer to $1,388CDN. I need to know how they can justify a $229 uplift on the exchange rate! I can't. I am extremely unhappy with this. I have cancelled my flights and rebooked with Expedia.com as they actually invoiced me in USD and my final cost in CDN was $1,354. Exactly where it should have been when I booked with United. It's time they revisited their policies and either allow their clients to book in the currency of their choice, or charge an acceptable exchange rate. This is flat out greed on their part. I am glad I was able to work around their insane system and get the price I was quoted.",1
2019-09-28,0.9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Honolulu,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,cabin crew were fantastic,False," San Francisco to Honolulu. The brickbat is that we were denied entry to the Business Class Lounge at SFO because we were not members of its Lounge group. Ridiculous. We have always had access to Business class lounges as long as we have spent the money with that airline. The departure time was then delayed because of a flat tire. Another brickbat. The plane had been sitting there for two hours and nobody noticed it before? One we took off, the cabin crew on flight UA300 in Business class were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and they were really engaging with the passengers. Brilliant crew but I doubt if United management will ever thank them for their service. I tried on United’s website but it is so difficult to get through with all the squares that have to be filled in. However, well-done to the entire crew of UA300.",1

Customer Service is practically non existence. United is even worse than the worst budget airline in the market. Ridiculous in every way you can ever imagine. Bad food. Bad inflight entertainment, rude crew, bad time management. I would only recommend United if you want to experience what it is like to feel and be treated like garbage. Yes, like trash and garbage. That's how they treat you. If you have always been travelling on good airlines and want to try the worst look no more. United Airlines fits the bill. Totally junk airline.",-1

Awful customer service and illogical policies. They bury a lot of rules in the fine print, such as not being able to make any changes and only allowing one bag, which are typical changes that anyone would make. Since I had to make changes, and had two normal size bags, this flight cost me twice the original cost, which wasn’t cheap to begin with. Gate agent was also a very unpleasant woman. I’m a frequent traveler and will never choose United again. Just very, very disappointed in this major carrier.",-1

I am a premier 1K, have flown over 3 Million miles collectively, and I support United even with bad food, low quality service and today United is above the law, let me explain; the electrical outlet on the USB ports where not working and I needed to get my conventional charger from the overhead, about ten minutes to find it in my bag. The passenger from the aisle across jumps up and complains to me about the overhead bin being open, and then complains to the flight attendant. The flight attendant comes over to me in a aggressive manner and dresses me down then proceeds to tell me ""it will get a lot worse for me"" with a threat tone. Really flight attendant, get all your facts in order before you threaten a loyal customer on United, and for United, please address the open complaint I filed. You cannot threaten people without understanding all sides of the situation, maybe some classes on passenger rights is in order.",-1
2019-09-25,1.0,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Washington,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4,professional and focused,True,"  United is a class show, and particularly business class. However, they took it up a notch with the outstanding service of Miroslav. He was every bit as professional and focused as most United flight attendants. Still, he found a way to take great service even farther. He paid close attention to how he could make the flight better. He went out of his way to offer ice cream, drinks, and food. He had a number of guest to attend to, but he interacted with each of them and did so without seeming rushed. The food on the United flight was great and the business class seating was fantastic .. a real joy to fly for nine hours straight.",1
2019-09-24,1.0,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Melbourne via Los Angeles,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,have never seen this level of service or care,True," I am forever grateful to the ground staff, administration and overall coordination of the team at United for turning a potential disaster into a wonderful trip. I have a mild seizure disorder, which resulted in an episode during our stopover from MEL at LAX to EWR. As a result, I was hospitalized for 3 days. During this time, they offered hotel and food vouchers to my wife, assisted with summoning medical attention. After spending 3 days in hospital I naturally assumed that our onward flights would be forfeited, so we re-booked. After re-booking, we received a call from United, inquiring into my health and overall condition to fly. Not only did they refund our onward booking, but upgraded my sister in-law who had flown in from NJ to assist my wife for the return journey to Newark. I have never seen this level of service or care from an airline before, and am most appreciative of their genuine concern and care that we reached our destination. I was overwhelmed that an organization of that size even knew about it, nor cared to do something about it. I have been a frequent business traveler for 10 years, and was previously a patriotic customer of Qantas. After a few nightmarish encounters (ranging from them pretending to go bankrupt in 2011, and gross mishandling of the Ash Cloud in 2010) I decided to try another airline for travel to the US. United were a breath of fresh air, with their luxurious and friendly cabin service exceeding the standards of even Emirates or Etihad. The welcoming and warm atmosphere in the cabin, combined with a delicious restaurant quality, multi-course meal (with generous portion sizes), plus the most comfortable premium cabin flat-bed seats (that I can actually sleep in, being a taller than average guy) lead to a fantastic experience. Congratulations to the entire United Airlines team, keep up the great work. Sincere Thanks, and I look forward to our next flight with you.",1
2019-09-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Appalling customer service,False,"  I’m usually not one to complain on social media, but to say that I’m beyond annoyed is an understatement. We booked our honeymoon trip as a package deal through Costco travel and our flights were booked with United Airlines. The flight there, we had a short layover in San Francisco and the flight was delayed going there so we were literally running to the connecting flight. We made the flight (barely) but our bags did not, so we spent the first 24 hours of our honeymoon without our clothes or toiletries. Flash forward 10 days to our flight home, same situation delayed flight with a short layover, 20+ people were catching the same connecting flight to Chicago. I went up to the desk and overheard several other people ask about if the flight would be informed of the delay. The employee at the United desk in Maui told me that with so many people on the flight they would be informed and that the flight would be held for the 22 people catching it. Flight landed and they switched our arrival gate to the other side of the airport and sat on the runway for a good 20 minutes before we have to wait for the whole plane to deboard. 22 people are running from one side of the airport to the other only to find out that they were not informed of the delay and could not wait an 5 extra minutes for a good portion of their customers, and left without us. Customer service was a nightmare and did the bare minimum to help us with this situation that was completely their fault and one that could have been totally avoided. Now we are stuck in San Francisco for the night without our bags again. We will never fly United again! I have never had such poor service while traveling. Appalling customer service!",-1

We booked preferred seats (economy just behind the economy+ rows, window seat) more than a half year before. The day before the flight the aircraft changed, so we were seated in economy+. The day we flew back, the aircraft was changed again and we were seated in regular economy in the rear of the plane, even not a window seat anymore. No refund whatsoever. Old plane, limited entertainment system, everything is worn out. Service on board (food/drinks) is far below average. Very unfriendly crew, more busy with themselves and trying to serve the dinner asap so that they had the rest of the flight off (constantly going into/out the staff quarters). Economy seats are much smaller than before: upright seats are more bend over than upright, very limited leg space.",-1

I noticed in Washington airport (Dulles) that my baggage was damaged (wheel completely ripped off), so I contacted the staff who told me that I needed to report the issue once I reached Montreal. So when I arrived in Montreal, I went to the United desk to report the incident. The staff there didn't bother much and told me that the company doesn't cover this damage. I contacted the customer service online, and after 5 weeks they told me that there is nothing they can do for me. So I am left with damaged baggage and the resolution to never fly with this company again.",-1

My flight was canceled due to weather in Houston tomorrow. I needed to get back to Amarillo tomorrow. I requested a refund. And they only gave me a quarter of my money back and not half. Obviously United Airlines is not customer friendly. I thought American Airlines was bad but that’s nothing compared to United. I guess Southwest Airlines is the way to fly.,-1
2019-09-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to to St Louis via Houston,1.0,,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1,I expect to receive a real refund,True,"  Cancun to to St Louis via Houston. When we booked our trip we paid extra not to have a long wait for our connecting flight in Houston. We were supposed to depart from Mexico at 6am. We arrived at the airport around 3 am to find out our flight was delayed till 10am. There was zero communication from United to let us know our flight was delayed by hours. We waited in Mexico for 7 hours and we missed our connection in Houston and had to wait another 6 hours. This has been a horrible traveling experience and a complete waste of time. The reason our flight was moved is because there was no flight crew. That is completely at fault of United and their lack of communication to their customers. I filed my initial complaint with United on August 31st 2019 and when I heard back from them they were only willing to give out vouchers at that point I asked for someone in charge and the employee stopped responding to my emails. I called United to express my terrible experience and they told me to file a refund request, which I did and they denied that and sent me back to the complaints saying ""they handle those cases better"". I called again after the email refund rejection and during that call they told me that they do not have an actual phone number or anyone for me to speak to and I would have to leave a voice mail. Today on September 18th 2019 I received an email saying they will give me a travel certificate. Not only do they have terrible communication when you travel with them, but when you try to fill out a complaint for a refund for them completely wasting your time they just keep giving you the run around from department to department and no on is willing to listen to what you want and how a travel voucher is pointless, when I spent real money on this flight and I expect to receive a real refund not some voucher that will go unused. This is a warning for those who are thinking about flying United just save yourself the time an go with ANY other airline. There customer service is terrible and at this point I think they just give customers the run around till the customer gives up and just accepts their worthless voucher.",-1

If they didn’t mishandle my bags non of that would have happened. On another note I talked to their representative who promised to refund me a shopping gift card of $150 which would come in mail. After 2 weeks waiting nothing came I called them and a representative told me they are giving us travel credit of $150 worth. Up to now there is nothing that we’ve got from them.

2019-09-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to New Orleans,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,every error in the book,False," I will just relate our experience with UA today. You can judge yourself. On 15 Sep 2019 my wife and I were booked on the UA 2208 flight at 12:45 from Chicago to New Orleans. We arrived at the Chicago O'Hare airport at 10:30 only to learn at the check in kiosk that our flight had been delayed 2 hours. Ok, no big issue, it happens. We had spent about an hour at the airport when we learned our flight was delayed again, 2 more hours. This was a bit annoying. We are visitors from overseas and this is our first trip to United States. We only have 2 days in New Orleans and we expected to be in New Orleans and be checked in at our hotel early so we could have a nice and relaxed dinner on our first night in town. No such luck. Well, we waited one more hour and then we learned about the next delay. Now our flight would depart at 6PM. This was a serious setback for us. There would be no time for dinner upon arrival and actually we started to get worried if we would make it to New Orleans at all this day. We went up to the United Customer Service desk to inquire what the problem was and explore our options. We staff told us that the flight had been delayed and that there had been a change of aircraft but the flight was now in the air, somewhere. We asked why the repeated and long delay? It was because of the weather they said. This was the first I heard about a ""weather problem"" and only just before they had said that there had been a change of airplane? We asked if there was something they could do. It was four and a half hours until our flight would leave, maybe, and we wanted to know if there was any other option. Any other airline or route? The answer was that they checked just before and all other routes and airlines were full. We asked if they could get us into the lounge since it would be a little more comfortable for such a long wait. The answer was ""Sure, for 59 dollars I can"". Then we asked if there was anything at all UA could do to help us and alleviate the long wait? The answer was that because it was a weather problem it was out of the hands of UA so you will just have to wait. I asked what kind of weather. The lady in front of me said they didn't know and the lady next to her said ""It was a snow storm"". She said that with a smirk. (Today is Sep 15.) Now I was a little bit upset and I asked if they really wanted me to believe that weather was the cause of this delay. The answer was ""Are you calling me a liar?"". A bit of an escalation, quite unnecessary I thought. I said ""No, but you're telling me it is a weather issue but you don't know what it is?"". ""Well we just don't know. It's just the air traffic control, they don't tell us anything"". At this point I asked if she could just get us a pass to the lounge for $59 each. The answer was ""You have to the lounge to get that"". Then we went to the lounge, only to be met with a sign that said they were full and couldn't accept any more open passes. Having a background in Customer Service, I find that UA today neatly ticked every missed opportunity and made every error in the book.",-1

I live in Northern New Jersey and so have been flying United Airlines out of Newark for work and leasure for about 10 years. This was because I did not want to brave the New York City traffic to get to LaGuardia or Kennedy Airports. After my last 4 flights with United, I've decided it's time to explore other options even if it means braving NYC traffic! Schedules are not kept, planes are dirty, bathrooms are not stocked with necessities, seats are in disrepair, wifi works roughly 50% of the time. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, where I had purchased a first class seat, the cabin was filthy, the seat in front of me was broken, so that it was reclining back so far back that I could not use my tray table, and the cabin crew were genuinely unfriendly. We didn't even get the customary predeparture drink. On another flight to Los Angeles, the seat was again broken, plane was filthy, and staff were rude. There has got to be a better option, even if it means going all the way to Kennedy!",-1

My biggest mistake ever when I booked a flight from Boston to Newark on July 10th. the flight got cancelled for technical reason. I had a connection flight one hour after and nobody was available to help me - not only me but many others were nervous and angry about what happen and only 2 persons were helping hundreds of people in customer service section. It took me 22 hours from Boston to Vancouver. The worse part was the receptionist and the workers that were working to provide the customer service were very rude, and aggressive. I just wanted to get back home as I felt helpless and disrespected during all time.",-1

I paid for a plane ticket and the flight was supposed to be at 6AM to LAX. This flight was not for me, it was a gift to my significant other. This flight was so important because he was suppose to meet is family he hasn’t seen in 5 years. We had a ride set up for him so he wouldn’t have to pay for transportation from the airport. We really did not have a lot of money to even pay for the flight. We are both struggling college students. I got off of work Friday night, could only sleep for 4 hours, and then drove 2 hours to Vegas, for Him to make it to his flight on time. Right when I drop him off I get call from him that his flight was 5 hours delayed. That means he’s sitting at the airport at 4:30AM for almost 7 hours. This completely destroyed our whole itinerary. His ride can’t pick him up in California, now we have to pay $60 or more for transportation. He is now hours and hours late to his event and meeting his family. I paid for a flight so early in the morning so he could be there and it was delayed for not just an hour but 5 hours, and he’s having to stay there for almost 7 hours running on 4 hours of sleep. Now we are having to pay even more money for transportation to an event he’s extremely late to.",-1

San Francisco to Phoenix. Consistently delayed and being lied to in the process. Turns out the airplane scheduled for the trip has been in maintenance all along and not ""delayed in the air"" as passengers were told. United appears to be low on planes.

So we will miss our flight and pray that there is another flight to Roanoke. Not only did United overbook our flight but then they downsized the plane.

Well, that never happened. By the time we realized it the first class cabin was full and so here we are, in the claustrophobic coach cabin. I better get a refund or I will be very angry.",-1

On my return same problem So I asked to talked to their agent and he was rough telling me not deserve a first class ticket as I bought coach and only paid for upgrade one segment. I never upgraded my segment I bought first class all the way I was explaining nicely and his answer was not.

I had to fly from Providence to Portland via Washington and made the reservation less than a week before the flight. The seats are not only tiny but they have left no room for your feet and legs. The chair in front was practically in my lap. The chairs don't lean back! and are so uncomfortable. When I made the reservation I asked for a window seat not over the wing and got a window seat over the wing without a window. The second leg of the flight, on the Airbus 320 (I think) was the one with the awful seat. The service was terrible. Southwest has the best in air service in my opinion. Alaska's is also good but United's was terrible - almost non-existent. On a 5 hour flight stewardesses came by only once to ask if you'd like food or drink and only one other time at the very very end offering water. Honestly, I thought I might die! I had to get up and ask since no one responded to my pressing the service help button! It all feels very cheap, minimal and impersonal. Given the choice I will never fly United again.",-1

This company keeps taking my miles from me, is second time they take my miles and this time they will not give back because I haven't flown with them in 18 months. I quit flying with them because it is full of rude people every time I fly. Has lost my luggage before coming home from Dominican republic and delivered to my house days later and never gave me airline credit of $100 on my next flight as promised. Left me sitting on a plane coming home to Charlotte from thru Atlanta. sat in the plane for over an hour at charlotte waiting to get off because they had issues with the ramp that connected to the plane, no airline credit there even though they took my name and promised to contact me. Delayed flight to Dominican connecting through NY, left me stranded in the airport all night till next day morning flight, no offer of a hotel to sleep till next flight, let me sleep in the uncomfortable chairs, even though it was their fault I missed my connecting flight. Then on top of that the people at the counters and the on the airline are just rude. They wonder why I choose to fly with other airlines. I fly 10 times a year nationally and internationally. but talking to a rude customer service lady tonight, told me I lost my miles again, and nothing they will do to help me even though I am getting on one of their planes this weekend for Newark NJ this weekend, will be the last time I use this company.

2019-09-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St. Louis to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,have yet to see my refund,True,"  St. Louis to Chicago. First and last time I fly with this company. I usually chose Delta or southwest and regret not sticking with them. On Aug 25th, I had a flight to Chicago. From there I was to fly to Greece. The flight was delayed by 10 minutes, I thought “ok nothing to worry about, I have 3 hours by the time I arrive in Chicago to my next flight to Greece”. Then there was another delay and then another. Starting to panic I asked the customer service representative what was going on, worried I wouldn’t make it. They assured me to relax and that I would make it. They however didn’t have any answers at that time why it kept being delayed. Then I got another delay and then yet another saying delayed until the next day. That’s when tears started pouring down my face, I was going to miss the flight to Greece. The trip I had planned and saved for for so long. I went up to the same customer service representative trying to breathe. They said there was a flight with another airline right then and I had to run to the gate to make their flight. So I full force ran upstairs to the other airline. Sweating and wiping tears from my eyes I arrived, just for them to tell me it was too late and that they didn’t know why United would have me do that. If after the first delay anyone in the company knew what was going on with the airport and would have communicated that with me, I could have made my flight. Instead your company cost me over $3000 and more delays for the trip I worked so hard to get. Thank you and never again. I still have yet to see my refund also.",-1

And for the 4th time, my flight is delayed. This flight was delayed 4 hours 15 minutes. I won't even be able to get the rental car I requested because it will be closed at the time of arrival.

After the first leg of our flight being delayed several hours, we did not make our connecting flight and then were rudely told by the desk agent that they didn't have time to rebook us as they were too busy. Called the 800 number and was told the only option was to wait 13 hours in Newark to get a flight to Albany and that there was only one seat so either my husband or I would have to sit in the airport overnight. To add to this, our luggage was lost as well. Finally ended up renting a car and driving nearly 5 hours home. Was then told on Aug 26 that the last leg would be refunded by a supervisor in the call center. It's 9/6 and still no refund. Called today and was told by the first inept phone agent that the refund never took place and ""I don't know why"". Spoke to a supervisor who said due to a ""system error"" it never happened and that she now processed it, but we have to wait another 7-10 business days. United Airlines has really sunk down to the lowest level of quality. I've flown with them for nearly 20 years, but the last several trips have been a nightmare. The customer service agents are clueless and read from a screen repeatedly ""apologizing for the inconvenience"", which is not the get out of jail free card for bad service that United seems to think it is. We are done with United and will not spend another dime with them. They should take a lesson from even budget airlines such as Frontier as to how to properly provide service I suggest hiring call center employees who have a slight clue and don't simply regurgitate statements from a pre-written script. We all know you save money by sending your call centers out to other countries, but your customer service level is -5 on a scale of 1-10.",-1

2019-09-06,0.5,Business,First Class,Washington to Las Vegas,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2,turned into an awful airline,True,"  I was recently booking a first-class fair on United.com on the mobile app on my phone. I had gone through the booking been quoted a price selected seats and when I went to push the button that read agree and purchase the pop-up on my screen was there was a problem completing your reservation. I subsequently contacted United immediately and they advised that all of the fares at that price had been sold out. I am traveling with two friends we were traveling together all the same flight all in first class. The United representative proceeded to tell me that the fair had increased $518. Now mind you, I wasn't surfing the web I had locked onto the seats I was quoted the price I had put in my credit card I'd selected seats and was merely pushing agree and purchase. United has turned into an awful airline. The food in first class is a laugh. You get a basket of chips on a five hour flight. At least on American you still get a decent meal. You call the call center that can do nothing which you on hold say that I speak with a supervisor and it is always a useless call for which you will wait at times a significant amount before somebody even picks up. I assume they had given up all pretense of having any loyalty. For first-class flyers there are no reward for regular flyers because they sell first-class to anyone including bidders up until the flight itself. There are no first-class seats saved to reward people who fly all the time. I have complained to United documentation the purchase prices the screenshots for my phone and I'm awaiting a response. If I could never fly United again I would. Except when they control the route, and they often do, they should be avoided at all times the customer service is essentially nonexistent. Anyone that has a good experience with United is merely lucky. Merely read the reviews you see here. I'm hoping for a successful result in a refund but I hardly think that would result in me being happy as I must get on their beat up old plane fly to Las Vegas in first-class where they were bring by a basket of chips and suggested that his first-class service. I'm not sure what their future is but if you apply standard business tactics you treat customers like this the future can't be that bright.",-1

We believe that UA should close their lounge and request a Star Alliance lounge in NRT. The ANA lounge offered full meal, including sushi and on demand warm meals. Boarding was smooth in a retrofitted Boeing 777 with Polaris seats (1x2x1) that offered a perfect comfort for this 6 hours night flight. Crew was extremely attentive, and as good as to NH on this line. We understand that when UA faces real competition, they are able to provide an excellent level of service. Good news.",1

The flight was typical but there three disappointing surprises along the way. The onboard food very very expensive - We had the hot dog for over $13 CDN. So the three of us paid about $40.00 CDNfor 3 hot dogs - This would cost $4.5 at Costco - a $35 savings.  There is no inflight entertainment. At the beginning of the first flight the said we need their APP just before they pulled away from the gate so I wasn't able to download. before the next flight, I downloaded it but it would not work properly on my LG4. Before we flew home, there was an update to the app so I was hopeful that I would be able to watch movies on my trip home (about 14 hrs) but, nope, it still didn't work.  There are extra fee for checked in bags - They really nickle and dime you. The one thing that did impress us is that after taking three flights, our luggage actually arrived with us - both to our destination and home.",-1
2019-09-05,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Chicago,1.0,,3.0,,,2.0,1,No one should have multiple bags,True,"  Newark to Chicago. For as many times as an airlines clearly states to only bring on a carry on and a personal item, no one ever checks. It is very frustrating when there are enough overhead space for a small carry on, yet everyone puts everything in the bins especially when you are not sitting there in the two rows that are designated to each one of them. They are labeled for a reason. No one should have multiple bags or the whole bin to themselves. This would not only save time if they were properly check but would stop individuals who are taking advantage of this system to not hold up the line and take more then one spot. I do applaud American Airlines for taking the time to check unlike United Airlines and I have flown with them for the last 15 years.",-1

Granted, I am traveling first class, but I had everything I needed. The flight was easy to reschedule from its original day, which was necessary due to Hurricane Dorian. I was stuck on a cruise for a few extra days and it was really easy to change my flight. Onboard, the seats were comfortable and staff was helpful.

These planes are so small. The seats have no padding in them. Luckily I knew my seat mate as my head hovered over his knees to retrieve items from under my seat. And I do yoga! Two people can't pass in the aisles to get to the tiny bathrooms without becoming familiar. And only two privies! The direct TV is worthless if there is any turbulence. The movie choices are for 12-year-old boys. Think superhero. Gone are the hand held devices for controlling the ""entertainment"". Instead, money conscience engineers located the controls in the armrest. Awkward to control and easy for your neighbor to change your channel by mistake. Which happend regularly. Squeeze as many bodies in here as possible and forget about comfort. United is only interested in their bottom line. Clearly! The Greyhound bus of the skies.

The service at the check in was terrible as there was a long argument on checking in a 2nd suitcase. Based on the United application, used for check in, I was allowed to check in 2 suitcases (1 from the ticket, 1 as a Star Alliance Gold). Getting to the airport the employee at the desk did not accept this as the system does not allow him to do that. Showing the details on the application didn't change anything, as he simply shrugged saying that I still have to pay for the 2nd suitcase. After insisting for a while, he called someone on the phone. No change. I asked him then, what is a customer supposed to do when one cannot trust the information on the application. His response was to call the customer service before the flight. Until today, I am not sure if he was serious or was making fun of me. The plane was small, not very comfortable and inflight service includes coffee. I try to avoid United when I can.",-1
2019-09-03,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to San Francisco,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,,5.0,3,could not sit comfortably in my seat at all,False,"  Kansas City to San Francisco with United Airlines. As a mother, I am very appreciative of United's policy on being family friendly, however, not at the expense of other paying customers. Part of the problem I encountered on this flight maybe could have been avoided. A very adorable toddler sat directly behind me and was not a happy camper, and expressed it for the whole duration of the flight. Although, this was highly stressful for all parties involved, sometimes this can happen. However, this was excessive. In my opinion the mother was ill prepared to distract, entertain, or comfort her toddler. In this case she could have done a much better job, but sometimes children are inconsolable no matter what parents do. Given that there is such tight seating, the little guy literally kicked the back of my seat the whole 4 hour flight. It was very stressful. Having former back surgery this was very uncomfortable. I leaned forward in my seat for the majority of the flight putting strain on my back as well. I could not sit comfortably in my seat at all. In addition, I tried listening to a movie through earbuds, but having to press the earbuds into my ears just to hear. Even then, it didn't drown out the screaming. Being very tolerant and sympathetic to the little guy, I endured because it isn't his fault. I think we adults can do a better job in regards making children more comfortable during flight. I think that policy can change to help all parties involved. If United is truly family friendly and they care about their other paying customers, they can make the premier seating available to families first at no extra charge. The little ones would have more room to move around, and parents have more room to handle a wiggling uncomfortable toddler. Another option could be, for children under two years of age, the child gets a seat at no extra cost. Both of those options would truly be more friendly to all customers, but it would cut into profits. This is a real problem especially when it goes beyond a little fussiness which everyone expects. We all need more room, especially those little ones.",-1

However, we were given a flight voucher due to seating inconvenience, for $150 which is only good on a United airlines only. Even if booking through United Airlines website and the airline is operating under United Airlines you cannot use, so if you're flying out of the country it is useless.  Other than that I love United airlines we flown with them for several years on multiple trips. But I would like to make everyone aware that this voucher isn't all it's cracked up to be. Especially when most of your flying is international anyway. And they have also stopped doing a One-Stop flight from most places in the United States until the seasonal - which is generally November through Easter. So if your intentions are to fly to Mexico during any other time you will have to make two stops which is also very inconvenient.",1

To be clear, my wife wasn't cussing out anyone. She wasn't directing an insult at anyone. She wasn't being loud. She wasn't being obscene. She complained about really bad customer service, and used a bad word as a verbal intensifier. So we were threatened with arrest.",-1

Delays of 5 hours (4 hours to wait in the plane to get us out of the plane at the 5th hour) but it's not all the excitement is that my suitcase is lost or late for now I do not know not. Everyone with their suitcases except me ... for the delay every hour I received an SMS informing me of the change and the continuity of the delay was A nightmare.

2019-08-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Albany to Portland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline I've ever flown,False,"  Worst airline I've ever flown. United used to be an average, run of the mill US Airline. Starting a few years ago they began charging for every little thing, their customer service tanked and their ability to check people in and have flights arrive on time is abysmal. After my last terrible experience with a 5 hour delay with no reason given, I swore to never fly United again. Unfortunately for this trip, the airline I booked with changed schedules that no longer accommodated my trip. I booked through Priceline and the ticket was through United. United is one of the only major airlines that skimps on meals/snacks in the air. If you want more than water, pull out your credit card. They are also one of the only major airlines that have a 9""x14"" carry on size. Sure, almost all airlines charge you for checked baggage but they also allow you to bring a carry on that you can fit things in. Unless you can pack in a briefcase you'll be paying United's $60 fee for ONE bag. United has NO in flight entertainment. Unless of course you want to pay extra for that. Their leg room is ridiculous, except they did move around some seats on a few of their planes recently so that there are few rows with extra leg room. And you can pay extra for that. Did you want your flight to dependably arrive on time? Too bad you can't pay extra for that. Unless the stars align, you're SOL if you're flying United.

There was a male flight attendant who was working the first class section on this flight. As I boarded the plane, he asked me if I could wait while he delivered water to the first class customers. Little did he know that I was actually not feeling very well at all. I replied with, “that’s great.” He then came back and said, “oh, do you have a problem with that?” I could not believe how extremely rude he was. Such poor customer service. After the flight, he told me to “have a wonderful day” using what appeared to be a very sarcastic tone. I most definitely did not appreciate the way this flight attendant spoke to me. I understand that he could have been having a bad day. They happen to all of us. However, kindness is key. I am sure he has potential to be a great employee; I just hope he is given the opportunity to see how he treated me and made me feel.",-1
2019-08-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Norfolk,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,It is miserable every time,False,"  Newark to Norfolk. This is maybe my 4th time flying with United. Today they switched the gate because the plane had “maintenance” issues (not a huge deal). This was followed by putting us on another aircraft, boarding then sitting for 1 1/2 hours because one of the crew had an problem with his iPad. While sitting on the plane for an hour and a half there was a non stop high pitched screeching coming from that plane that was concerning and irritating to everyone on board this very tiny plane. I have never had a good experience with a United and only fly with them when it is absolutely necessary for my travel plans. It is miserable every time. I would not recommend to anyone. My flight has no option for entertainment such as a tv screen.",-1

On time, clean comfortable factory fresh 787. Even the economy meals were decent. Baggage arrived timely. Only complaint is lack of seating at gates in newark, all available space now taken by revenue generating restaurants. I have been a long time CO and then US flyer, and have had years of overwhelmingly good experiences. I just don't get the hate.",1

No problem with them fitting in the overhead bin. The person taking carry on bags insisted on taking my bag when I assured him it would fit. My husband was allowed to keep his bag identical to mine and placed it in the overhead bin with no problem. The employees at United are very rude! I can’t stand this airline I only use it because it is one of the few airlines out of Palm Springs!,-1
2019-08-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Melbourne via Los Angeles,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst experience I have had,True,"  Newark to Melbourne via Los Angeles. This is the worst experience I have had with an airline. Too begin with, Newark airport is the worst airport in America. After arriving 2 hours early for my flight I only just made my flight, there was only ONE single united employee behind the desk, it took me an hour to check in my bags. Then there is the fact that it took another hour to wait in line just to get through customs because of the horrendous system at Newark international. But this is not even my main complaint, once on the plane we waited a total of 5 hours on the tarmac before the plane took off to LA. I have never in my life heard of people waiting this long to take off. Even when we pulled back into the gate after 3 hours stuck on the plane, we were told not to leave because if we did and the plane was ready to go, they would leave without us. This experience only gets worse. Because we were not taking off the flight attendants refused to serve any food meals. Because I had planned to buy food before my flight and couldn’t because the of the agonising wait time at the airport, I had not eaten a proper meal in 12 hours. I was forced to remain in basically inhumane conditions unable to eat, starving for the longest time in my life. Once the plane finally left the airport, it was inevitable that the only hot meal they had available was a hotdog and due to the terrible service, they ran out of them very quickly (most people didn’t get a meal). Once I finally arrived in Los Angeles, United supplied those that missed their connecting flights new tickets. My new flight is now 18 hours from the time I arrived in LA. I have never waited this long for a new flight in my life. I have travelled South America and even in impoverished countries with low budget flights, I was NEVER EVER forced to wait so long for another flight. On top of this, we were given only $30 dollars for meal vouchers. That equates to 1 meal and a snack in Los Angeles, so how does united expect you to survive a full day on only 1 meal? The truth is that they don’t! They expect you to pay for your own food and drinks while you wait for a flight that they messed up. When I asked for at least more food vouchers I was told that it was “against policy” to give more and the lead manager apologised for the “embarrassing ” customer service from United. Even your own employees understand how embarrassing this excuse for an airline is. To compensate me for the fact I am now missing a family event, they offered a measly 100-dollar voucher on the next flight I decide to take with the company. The further problem with this pathetic severance for this awful experience is that it expires within a year! So you have a deadline to fly again with this tragic airline. I’m writing all this because you should know that I will not be accepting the horrible service and “apology” I have received. Nobody deserves to be forced through the conditions you put your customers in. I wouldn’t put my worst enemy through this experience. The Newark to Melbourne via Los Angeles. Worst airline in not just North America, but the worst in the entirety of the American continents.",-1

How is it that the airline requires it's customers to show up at least 2 hours before their flight and there is nobody available at the ticket counter to check a bag until 4am? Every other airline has representatives available. With the amount of money you people charge for a ticket there should always be a representative available for your customers.,-1

Third time in the past month their plane was delayed by over 2 hours due to mechanical issues. They ended up cancelling the flight. I called customer service. They said they couldn't do anything, and to talk to the gate agent. Once we deboarded the plane, I talked to the gate agent, and once again they said they couldn't do anything and to talk to customer care. They make you go in circles. Now I am waiting at customer ""care"" in the airport with 14 people in front of me. United is an awful airline, only cares about money, and doesn't care about it's customers.",-1
2019-08-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,First Class,Phoenix to Kona via San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,nothing but headaches,True,"  
Phoenix to Kona via San Francisco. Hawai’i - a - no - go is all I can say about our move thanks to United Airlines. My family was originally booked to leave PHX (Phoenix AZ) to KOA (Kailua Kona HI) on Tuesday August 13th; departing at 530 AM with a connection in SFO (San Francisco) departing at 831 am. Only to receive a phone call at 300 am stating that there was an overbooked situation and that we were going to be placed on a flight departing at 1229 PM. That was not the case at all! We never received an updated confirmation and in calling to verify were told that we would be placed on standby. The next flight that we would be confirmed on was not until Monday August 19th but we would be upgraded. Unfortunately come Monday my partner was sick, he has Multiple Sclerosis, and was needed to see the doctor that day to be able to fly. (not United’s fault) United said they could rebook us on a flight leaving Thursday August 22nd with rebooking fees. Thursday came and the same scene happened again; we were alerted that our 1229 PM flight to SFO had been oversold and that we were going to have to go on a 1000 AM flight to LAX (Las Angeles), then to SFO (San Francisco) , then to OGG (Maui) spend then night in the airport and take the next day’s morning flight to KOA (Kailua Kona HI) on Hawaiian Air! Now it is Friday August 23rd and we are still in Phoenix awaiting our new flight on Hawaiian come Sunday. So in short if this were a vacation, it would have been ruined. Luckily we are able to get a refund and rebooked on another airline  and are moving and have our home until the end of August here in Phoenix! Thanks for nothing but headaches and no follow through United.",-1

I booked my flight weeks before my departure date of 8/9/19. I woke up to a text message saying my flight was cancelled to Denver CO. No reason why. Now I was only going until the 8/14 and had limited time with my family and many plans were made for my visit in Idaho falls which was to arrive at 10:25 am. I could not get another and waited for hours on the phone. I eventually found a flight through Houston to Denver to Idaho Falls. I arrived to my destination at midnight. While in Denver I noticed nothing wrong at the airport. I ended up losing a whole day. I am very busy and I wouldn’t have taken this trip if it was a day shorter.  Everything else was fine on my trip.,-1

Our family of 6 missed our flight to The Maldives even though we were all at the terminal at least 2 hours before our departure. We informed a staff that the line was taking too long & that we were afraid of missing our flight. He literally walked away from us instead of checking us in & getting us a cart to security. We got stranded at the airport for an entire day. They even tried to charge us a no show fee of $600.00 a person. Will never fly Emirates ever again.,-1

It’s honestly disgusting you can call yourself an airline company. I will never ever be taking United fights ever again. After the countless mistakes given today I could have driven faster to my destination and now instead I’m having a panic attack inside an aircraft that was updated over 30 times telling me we would depart by 1.50. Now it’s 4 o’clock. The aircraft is 4 hours late and I have no reason to be going to be going where I am because my meeting was already missed. I would like someone from United to contact me.,-1
2019-08-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rapid City to Chicago,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3,how terrible United is,False,"  Rapid City to Chicago. In a word horrible. We started off the day in a small airport, Rapid City regional airport. We then learned that our flight had been delayed for an hour because of thunderstorms, no problem right? Wrong. After an hour of extra waiting we finally boarded our flight to learn we had been delayed another hour. One word: O'Hare. We sat on the tarmac to learn our flight had been delayed 30 minutes. We then deplaned. We had been hanging around the gate for 5 minutes when they decided that they wanted board the whole plane again after 5 minutes at the gate. That was a waste of time, what didn't help was the front to back boarding also known as the reaper method due to the time it takes for the flight board compared from front to back which is sadly the industry standard. So our plane finally takes off and we get a small snack and an orange juice after almost 8 hrs without food. So we finally land and that's when you think it would be over. No, because of our delay there is another plane at the gate so we taxi on the runway for a full 50 minutes. Welcome to O'Hare I guess. We finally get off the plane to realize that our connecting flight had already taken off. So we had to rebook for a flight 3 hours later which wouldn't you know was also delayed. So here I am in the gate writing about how terrible United is.",-1

There is only one customer service with 2 persons and 100 customers who want to know if we finally are flying or not? I would never ever fly with United Airlines.

Basically canceled our 7.05pm Sunday evening flight for 7.05pm Monday evening flight which is ridiculous because they gave us notice at 4.14pm, about under 3 hours before boarding. Went to airport - basically the attendant stated it was snowing/raining and hence the reason for the cancellation. Completely unprofessional. Didn't even give us any discount/voucher for baggage check in. I hope $UAL stock price sinks. What a disaster of an organization where you can cancel at will. Smart move on their part to cancel due to weather related conditions. At least, book us onto an earlier flight. They also wouldn't give us a refund to use another airline which is ridiculous. I will never fly United after this experience. They do have a phenomenal tag line ""United We Cancel"". My cohort and I had work the next day and ended up having to call a day off.",-1
2019-08-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Prague to New Jersey via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,they couldn't care less about our dilemma,False,"  I am writing on behalf of my co-traveler/wife and myself regarding terrible and unbelievable experiences we had with United from Prague to LA via New Jersey EWR, on July 23, 2019. The first and second legs of our flights were with Austrian Airlines (OS 0082 and OS 0721) on July 11 and 15 which went through without a hitch and in most courteous and professional manner by Austrian. The third leg was with Czech Airlines (OK 079) on July 19 which again was also completed without a hitch. However, the fourth and fifth leg of the flight (UA 0187 and UA 2394) on July 23 were total disasters. In Prague airport, we were told that due to weather conditions the flight would be delayed approx 7 hours. Having given no other options for other United flights or otherwise, we had to wait out the delay and board the plane about 7 hours later. In New Jersey, having missed our connecting flight to LAX, again without any other options given by United, we had to stay overnight in Ramada Plaza Hotel (a virtual dump of a Hotel) for about 4 hours before returning to the airport for a 6am standby! Although vouchers were issued for the hotel (United's choice) and some food, we had to take a cab at our expense to the hotel, as no vouchers were provided, and it was very late at night. During all the interactions with United employees, customer service, supervisors, and hotel crew we were treated unprofessionally, rudely, nonchalantly, carelessly, and aggressively. At all times, the attitude of the United employees was insulting and such that they couldn't care less about our dilemma, and that they had heard these sort of complaints a million times before, that it is what it is, and basically take it or leave it. Beside suffering the aggravation and stress, the above delays, totaling a whole day, caused tremendous backlash for my wife and I, as we are both professionals with appointments and commitments to meet (which we missed), having counted on the on-time arrival in LAX. We could not even spend our food vouchers due to lack of time, and United flight crew denying our vouchers for food on the plane (EWR to LAX), and the Mexican Grill denial of vouchers in the food court of LAX arrivals. The way we see it, United has received its full payment for the tickets, but we have not received the full service promised nor have been compensated for our losses suffered. To say the least, improper actions or non-actions of United have bitterly ended a much-anticipated joyful vacation. If you have a choice, avoid United, and spare yourself lots of heartache.",-1

We boarded our flight on time and once we all got seated we were told there was going to be a 50 minute to an hour delay. This delay was due to us having to wait for people to first arrive to the airport via another plane and they had to get all the way over here. Why are we having to delay this flight that’s already pretty full for a flight that was delayed at another airport?,-1
2019-08-20,0.9,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to San Francisco,3.0,,4.0,,,5.0,5,This was very much appreciated,True," Departure delayed. This was the last flight to SFO and I had a connecting international flight that I had to board. The transit time was tight but doable if everything went on-time. My flight out of YVR was delayed by an hour which meant that I would have to literally run to the international gate at SFO. I explained this to the gate agent and he was very empathetic and made some calls. Although he could not promise, he did say that I would most likely be able to make my connection. He was also able to give me some alternatives in case I missed my connection. This was very much appreciated!",1
2019-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Denver,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,1,avoid United at all costs,True,  La Guardia to Denver. We arrived 1.5 hours before our flight. We spent 30 minutes in line to check in with United and the next 40 minutes getting through TSA. It was 4:45am on a Sunday morning. We barely made the gate before they closed it. The lady at the gate told us we should have arrived earlier as if it was our problem they were understaffed at checkin. They also seated our 2 kids(below 10 years old) separately to us and could not change it at checkin since they told us to try the gate and at the gate they said it was too late. I am not sure how an airline can operate so inefficiently. Lesson learned. It is worth an extra amount of money to avoid United at all costs and to fly JFK and avoid LGA no matter how good a deal it may be.,-1

Husband flew home in early July via United (Delayed), flew home end of July (Delayed more than 4 hours) via United, and we are flying again, United, have just been told we have a 24 mins delay, so far.

Ridiculous. Poor communication from the on-boarding crew which began with a delay - thanks to holding a previous flight to see if any last minute passengers would surface. Then following their late departure our plane, which was not ready, took another half hour (and still waiting) to arrive to the gate. We are now an hour into this delay, the bathrooms and terminal are essentially closing and this over sold flight is waiting with virtually no clue as to what is happening or if we will be leaving.

I was delayed out of Salt Lake City for an unknown reason for 2+ hours. Moved me between flights as I was told my new flight would arrive sooner, unfortunately for myself, the other flight arrived sooner and would have made my connection. We sat a hot plane in 90-degree weather for an hour and a half without the option to get off as it was ""United Policy"". Once I arrived and missed my connection I was rebooked to a flight to be on standby 2 hours later. Was initially 3rd in line when I booked. When boarding started I was bumped to 6th in line and finally when it came time to board I was 9th in line. 6 people on standby boarded the plane and I was not one of them.

Small delays happen sometimes. That’s to be expected. The issue that delays are a chronic problem with this particular airline where I’ve had delays as long as four hours.

This has been a miserable experience. To say the staff are rude is an understatement. From checking in at Heathrow to the flight to Houston the staff were rude and careless. My husband was told he didn’t order food for both meals on the flight and he did. Then when they went to get the forgotten food they brought out the wrong thing because that’s all that was left. He was never brought a drink with his food at any point. I ask if there was any snacks because the dinner terrible and was told rudely no snacks except the leftover cookies from dinner. Then she told me to go sit because they were in the middle of a shift change. About 2 hrs later I see literally an entire row eating salty crackers and chips that their attendant brought them! One gentleman attendant was kind in the first class cabin but I can’t remember his name. The woman who worked my husbands side really needs to retire. So we land in Houston and then the plane we are suppose to take home breaks. We are delayed without any estimate or explanation except that the plane is so broken they are retiring it. They are hoping to find us a new plane. They finally have us board the plane they told us was being retired. Then we sit on the plane in Houston heat for 45 mins. No apologies so told to keep waiting in 5 min increments. The attendant was somewhat nice on the Houston flight. The issues were more with the plane and the Check in staff. I’m done spending silly amounts of money with this airline. I’m flying Delta from now on. They at least get better service and on time reviews.,-1

Then due to weather we were delayed and had to change gates. Then we finally get on the plane and are the next plane to takeoff and the captain says we have to change crews. Now there are no return gates to go to and we are stuck in the plane. The pilots knew they were out of time but ran out the clock anyway, presumably so they can get their paycheck. There is no consideration for the customer. The service sucks. The captain provided little to no info. I’ve spent $3k for this flight and the experience so far is abysmal.",-1

The day of I get an alert telling me my flight is delayed. As time progresses more alerts with different take off times. I’m confused. I see an agent because at this point my boarding pass isn’t even the same any more. I was then told they changed my flight. I had to get a seat adjustment after nearly an anxiety attack being assigned an emergency exit seat. WiFi didn’t work! Then it’s a 5 hour layover in Houston so instead of landing in Memphis at my original time of 1916 I arrived at 2312!! Unacceptable. I normally fly Delta but tried saving money using United - never again. Pay the extra couple dollars. Oh and they managed to damage my Vince Camuto luggage to put icing on the cake,-1

To take that same route but starting in SAN and connecting in SFO on the same exact flight for the 694, cost only $200. Once again proving that these so called alliances are excuses to price fix with competitors nearly as bad as the cable companies and phone companies in the USA. As for the flight well the SAN flight was easy and pleasant considering more than half the plane was empty.

Polaris lounge was very professional and kind, could have been a little more attentive though. Friendly flight attendants and great food.  We got to chat with a friendly pilot for a while and got complimentary drinks. Was able to upgrade to business with my Chase miles credit card. Economy Plus was a little worse of course, but overall was great for the price.

Decided to fly with United both to our destination and back home. Both flights were cancelled, once due to a repair needed to be made on the plane which was never able to be completed and then again on the way home because their whole flight crew called in sick? It seems extremely unlikely that an entire flight crew would call in sick all at once, and they should have had a back-up plan in place ready for this ridiculous event. This airline has single-handedly influenced me to never fly anywhere again where I could just drive instead. United Airlines must be run by extremely incompetent people to allow for this to happen. 3/10 stars is giving this airline too much credit, I would rather walk than get on another United flight. Dreadful experience both ways, I beg you all to not waste your time with United.",-1
2019-08-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Melbourne,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,2,the most horrid food I have ever tasted,False,  Los Angeles to Melbourne. On our return flight to Australia of 16hrs we were served up with the most horrid food I have ever tasted. The main meal was small and tasted terrible. The snack some hours later consisted of a bread roll with an unknown filling. The roll was like it was a week old and I think it was a piece of cheese and was rock hard and very dry. The attendants did not ask in between if we wanted tea or coffee but only supplied water. Not the friendliest personalities. Woke me up while sleeping for a glass of water. The toilets were dirty and toilet paper was all over the floor and not cleaned during the flight. Will not fly with United again.,-1
2019-08-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Houston,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly with United ever again!,False,"  Los Angeles to Houston. I will never fly with United ever again! Yesterday, we were delayed boarding the plane, then had to get off and wait 2 hours to board back on. Then, we sat on the plane for about 30 min after they said we were going to begin moving onto the runway. We then moved onto the runway and then had to wait for something else the crew had to check, which about 15 more minutes. My TV in front of me also was inoperable, so my friend and I used their TV. Well, we tried, but the aux for the headphones was not working properly and we could not use the TV. Then once we got off the plane, apparently when we so happened to book our hotel in Houston from L.A., it never actually got booked. So we had to book it at Houston. Then we got two free meal vouchers. Which, I thank you for that, but, it was late at night and I didn't know that all of the restaurants closed at 10pm, so once I was ready, I went up to order and they were closed. Even the self serve and self pay stand was closed!  Then we went to pick up our bags at the baggage claim. We were not told which carousel to go to, so we were just wandering around the building looking for our bags, until someone finally brought them over from outside the building. Absolutely no communication with associates or to passengers. We also had to stay the night in Houston. Thankfully they gave us a free night at a hotel. We then went out to wait for the shuttle to go to the hotel, and we sat there for a good 20 minutes or so until we decided to take an Uber because they were taking way too long. In the morning, while going through security, I had already stepped through the scanner and had gotten my items that were in the tray and was just waiting for my bookbag. It was still in the scanner and then got pulled off to the side and it just sat there for a good 15 minutes when someone finally brought it over just to look through it and give it back. I had no trouble going through security with the same airline, the flight before this with the exact same objects that were in the bag. And check-out from the hotel was at 12pm and our flight wasn't until 6:30pm, so we had to wait in the airport all day when we could have stayed at the hotel for a few more hours and relaxed. Later, it was almost time to start boarding, and we are told there is a 2 hour delay because the crew/captain was not there yet. Thankfully it got moved up to 6:50 and we finally left around 7pm and arrived in Dayton around 9:30pm with no trouble. Everyone was nice, just, no one knows what they are doing and do not have any communication. Which is most likely why there are so many problems, not just with this flight but with many others. I’m even having trouble trying to send this review on their website.  We flew with Delta on our way to L.A. with absolutely no problems. Bottom line is, this airline sucks, and you will never be seeing me again.",-1
2019-08-11,0.9,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Singapore,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,United did good on this one,True,"  San Francisco to Singapore. Very Comfortable. I usually fly United on domestic routes. As I was now flying United on an international route for the first time, I was not sure what to expect. First, my inbound flight was late and i had to run from a domestic gate to the international terminal in SFO. The airline knew this and i was very surprised (and relieved) that they waited for us. After settling in, the flight took off and it was a very pleasant 18 hours. The aircraft was relatively new but the main positive were the flight attendants. They were all polite and basically did a good job looking after everyone. The flight served two meals and a light snack on this long flight. All three were tasty and reasonable proportions. The in-flight entertainment was also pretty good - i had no problem in choosing good movies to watch and catch up. All in all, a very nice and comfortable flight. In this age where we all report unpleasant service very fast, I am delighted to report that United did good on this one!",1

Yelling at customers because they put their bags in the over head compartment the wrong way, then when customer was not understanding what she meant, the attendant became louder and ruder.

I have just flown with United Airlines for the first time and I found the flight to be as good as or better than any other airline I’ve flown on including Singapore Airlines and Cathay.

We were suppose to leave at 9:30 am and left at 3:30 pm. First it was delayed in plane getting there, then the pilot was missing and then on top of it we were boarded in the plane and when the pilot showed up and did the last minute inspection and saw the tires were to be changed.. We were told to get off the plane again and as they had to change the tires so had to reboard again. The sage did not end there as when we arrived at Pittsburgh we stood at the gate for 10 to 15 minutes before the operation crew showed up. What a nightmare this flight was.

On my flight to Detroit, the plane started boarding at 7:00 and stopped boarding at 7:10. I got to the gate at 7:12. The podium attendant refused to let me through the gate and I had to sit at the airport until the next flight, three hours later. Coming back to Houston from Detroit. My ticket didn’t have a seat number on it. So I went up to the podium attendant to assign me, as my ticket stated. I have a hearing deficiency, which I was unable to hear her calling me originally. When I got up to the podium she refused to make eye contact with me and told me me that I have to move three feet back, making it to where I couldn’t hear her at all.",-1

The seat assignment is messed up. They put whoever had a connection with little time to get to the gate at the back of the plane, the first plane was 20 min late and the next flight was on time. They consider a wallet / purse as a carry on. We did have a good laugh . We didn’t choose to fly with United Airlines, I had no other choice. The seats are like an animal cafe the further we go back. They are absolutely not real. We were trying to get in plane and the flight attendant made us wait at the door so she can serve orange juice to first class (first class was a joke). Never like to fly with UA",-1

I checked my App which showed we were booked for morning flights to our destination. However, I got a message from Expedia saying that United cancelled our two flights tomorrow as well. No rerouting, no calls, they don't seem to care if you get to your destination. We are back home preparing for starting the process again tomorrow until we got the message from Expedia telling us the flights are again canceled. This is an important trip and I have a very important presentation at a conference in Ottawa. We are wondering if we need to purchase another ticket through a different airline at higher prices given that we must leave tomorrow when should have left today!

2019-08-05,0.1,Business,Business Class,Tel Aviv to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,treated in such a poor manner,True,"  Tel Aviv to Newark. I Put out some extra dollars for “Premium plus” cabin which was touted as business class comparable. Cost just over $3000 round trip for the ticket and not with it. Firstly - I was denied access to the lavatory right in front of me, mind you I did not have to pass through or by Polaris cabin. The fact that the toilet was not available to premium plus cabin customers would have been ok if that was the policy except that everyone else in my cabin was using it and even economy class customers. On asking why I was denied the flight attendant rudely replied to use the lavatory at the back in economy where my seat was although I indicated it was in premium plus. Secondly, the meal I was served was the same as economy class although it was advertised to be the same as Polaris. The economy class packaged meal was cold as a dog’s nose, the bread was stale and crumbling apart - and when I told the flight attendant, mind you I mentioned that I knew it was not her fault and would be happy with a snack or some chips to which she said no, she went on to Insult me and said that it was my fault that the meal was cold to my amazement? I immediately thought to myself - I just be in the twilight zone! She then signals to other flight attendants and points at me in an aggressive manner. At no time was I disrespectful or raised my voice. Now this made me very embarrassed and concerned for my safety so After declining to participate in any further refreshments out of fear and sitting quietly in my seat for 10 + hours into the flight, the flight attendant comes up to me and asks why I did t eat or drink anything for the approx. 12 hour flight and if I wanted anything just when the pilot instructs to fasten seatbelts for us to land. Really? I cannot comprehend why I was treated in such a poor manner but will be sure to spread the word as far and as wide in as many forums as possible in as many languages as I could This is the Worse Customer experience I’ve ever encountered and exacerbated as I was fearful for my wellbeing and worried of being victimized by the flight attendant.",-1

Every time I have ever flown with them the flight is delayed and no one tells you anything! They don’t even tell you the flight is delayed if you don’t check your email. They continue to act as if everything is normal, make you wait with no answers, put you on the plane only to have you sit there for over an hour before you take off and there is little to no information coming to you!

I am completely giving up on the ridiculous airline. I have yet to have one positive experience. Everything from cancelled flights, to extremely delayed flights, to sitting on the tarmac, bad service, poor planes and now I was refused to be let on my plane, when I still had 45 mins before departure on a domestic flight. The flights may be a little cheaper than some, but it’s not worth it. Especially when half the time you don’t make it to your destination at the time given.

The person at the desk switched us from gate to gate, while makeing a big deal about being at work for 5 hours. She argued with me about my seat being unsigned and it latter caused a small problem when I was trying to board. The airlines itself is just scamming people for more money when it comes to checking bags. You're only allowed one carry on bag... and forced to check the other for $30 or more.

I verbally told the surrounding crew that my next flight departs in 20 minutes. They were dismissive and ordered me to simply get on the bus. I had no other choice but to comply.

I mean arched as in all the economy seats were straight up (90 degrees) and with the “curve” on the seat it felt like it was leaning me forward forcing me to use my back. I couldn't sleep at all.

I must say I am very disappointed by United Airlines all the way around. The first thing is we where over an hour late leaving Logan with no announcement as to why the plane was there in the terminal and arrived on time then when we almost got to Chicago they said if we had gotten here earlier we wouldn’t have got stuck in this weather so now we are landing in Kentucky which resulted in us missing our flight to Dallas. Then the United staff at Ohare was very rude and wouldn’t accommodate us with a hotel for my pregnant wife and two kids saying it was due to weather which wasn’t fully the case. Then they have us 200 dollars in food vouchers and then we couldn’t use them on the plane the next day when we left the in flight staff treated us like we were welfare recipients when we asked. The overall customer service was poor and I’ll never use United again if they had compensated us I might have changed my mind but they didn’t and had a nasty attitude with me and my family about doing so.,-1

The weather was bad as well as mechanical issues. United helped us tremendously. It was first and foremost through Angelika, the agent in the Portland Maine airport who was helping dozens of us re-route our flights She was excellent. I can’t say enough good about her service. She was professional, she was tremendously competent. She was trouble-shooting and putting out fires left and right. She even was patient and helpful to the other agents that had questions when a problem would come up. She found other flights for us when Newark was completely out of the question. She gave us vouchers so we could find lodging and get some food. Then she even facilitated getting a taxi to drive us to Boston since we were not going to be able to reach our destination through Newark. Angelika was incredibly helpful and competent, plus friendly at the same time, despite the tremendous amount of stress she had to deal with because of the flight cancellations. Other people noticed her competency as well. I recommend her highly. She was the agent that worked on our counter all afternoon and into the evening on Monday, July 22. Personally I think she needs to be recognized for her outstanding competency. Thank you so much for taking care of us in such an unfortunate situation.",1

2019-07-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Oklahoma City via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst travel experience,False,"  By far the worst travel experience I have ever had. I have flown with United before and everything went fine but that's because all my flights were on time and I didn't have to deal with customer service. Yesterday 7/16/19 I was flying from SAN to OKC with a layover in DEN. Due to my flight leaving SAN late and then our plane having to ""do S shapes in the sky to let other planes land ahead of us"" I missed my connecting flight. I get it, things happen but the way United handled it was absolutely ridiculous. They canceled the second leg of my flight and refunded me $178 (I paid $450 for my flight including bags) without my consent. Then I was told since they did that the history of my ticket was out of their system so the ONLY way for me to be able to fly out of Denver was to buy another ticket. That would have been fine if there were tickets that would get me to OKC for $178 the same amount they refunded me for but of course there wasn't, they wanted me to pay $620 for a ticket not including bags which I had two that needed checked. After standing in line for an hour and then arguing with them for 2 hours telling them that the logic literally makes no sense at all, they booked me a flight to leave today for $318. Still had to pay for it which I will be fighting it once I get to OKC. After being at customer service for 3 hours everything was closed, they did not offer a food voucher or even simply a bottle of water. I had to sleep on the floor of the DEN airport. On top of that only one out of the three employees that ""helped"" me was actually helpful (the fact that it took two hours for her to do anything aside). Other employees were useless and completely rude- threw his hands up and walked away in the middle of my sentence because I was questioning how their logic makes any sense at all. Needless to say I will never fly this airline again. If I could give them no stars I would.",-1
2019-07-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to North Platte,4.0,1.0,5.0,,1.0,2.0,1,attitudes are unacceptable,True,"  I have never been so disappointed in an airline. Not only was our flight delayed by 7 hours, we never received any updates about anything and no one from the airline knew what was going on. We almost missed the flight that we got moved to because no one bothered to inform us about it. When we asked 5 different people about whether or not out luggage will be on the plane, we were told yes only to find out upon arrival that it was still back in our connecting city. They then promised to have it delivered within 24 hours, and once again, that was incorrect. 36 hours later, I received a soaking wet suitcase and no apology. It has been almost 2 months since the incident and we are still waiting for someone to reimburse us for the flight as well as the items that we had to buy to manage 36 hours without our stuff. Customer service has been helpless and no one cares. I will never fly United and their $200 travel certificates are a joke since we spent $700 on tickets. Their employees need to be trained in better customer service because their attitudes are unacceptable.",-1
2019-07-20,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Shanghai,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,3,flight attendants were very welcoming and professional,True," This is the first time I have flown the new Polaris Business Class on an international route SFO/PVG, Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I have flown back and forth to Asia many times on other Asian carriers, 4 times in the last year. Check-in in San Francisco was quick and efficient. I was given a priority pass for the security line which helped bypass the long lines. The Polaris business class lounge at SFO is one of the best in the world. Boarding the flight was on time with a separate line for business class. The flight attendants were very welcoming and professional. The business class seating on the Dreamliner was 2x2x2, all with double pods. There is some degree of separation. The seats were comfortable, but in the fully flat bed configuration, my feet were touching against the end of the pod in a small opening which cramped my feet together and I am 5'10"" tall. A taller person would find this very uncomfortable. I was sitting in 3B and I am a million miler flown on United. However, my first choice meal selection was not available as they had run out? The IFE selection is excellent, one of the best in the industry, but the television screen is fixed to the seat in front of you and cannot be tilted or moved. If you recline your seat and are looking at the screen at an angle, the quality of the screen diminishes and looses color and contrast. The overall trip was comfortable and ontime. I would have to say the flight was good, but not great. The Asian carriers flying the same route offer a much higher level of privacy with individual pods and larger beds and the quality and selection of food and service is outstanding.",1
2019-07-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Norfolk,,,,,,,1,Customer service is atrocious,False,  Houston to Norfolk. Customer service with United Airlines is atrocious! They have called me 6 times since I booked my son's flight on Saturday. I have used them for his unaccompanied minor flights for summer visitation for years as they have a direct route. I have always paid the unaccompanied minor fee the week of the flight as this is easier on my budget. Apparently this policy has changed unbeknownst to me. I verified at the time of the purchase of the ticket that I could in fact pay for the fee later and the manager said this was fine. This was of course not documented as were none of my 6 conversations that followed. They repeatedly asked me the same questions and I gave them the same answers day after day with no results. They refused to send me an email receipt for the ticket that I had paid for until the unaccompanied minor fee was paid. I will be using a different airline no matter the price difference. This has eaten up hours of my time due to horrible communication and customer service. If they had communicated a policy change in the first place I would have either paid for the entire thing at once or shopped for another ticket.,-1

The first leg was from Los Angeles to Washington and United refused to allow me to check in two baggage unless I pay $100 for each baggage. After showing the ticket and the routing which clearly shows that I am allowed 2 Piece of luggage the supervisor at LAX threatened me with not allowing me to board unless I pay the extra money for the second luggage.

United is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. My trip started out being delayed out of Newark because of some mechanical issues. I am a TSA pre check member and by far United cannot get their act together. Tried printing my ticket out 3 times and it will not show my precheck. You need to work on your system.

Never again will I fly United first class if I can help it. United's first class service is, at best, second class. We flew non stop from Washington, DC to Honolulu, HI. DC's lounge didn't open until late morning so there were no benefits on the ground. On board the seats were what you'd expect; service was mixed. One flight attendant was pleasant and one was rude. The on-board amenities are minimal - a pillow & blanket. Food options were available to some but several entrees were quickly, ""no longer available"". On our afternoon return we got United's notice that we should arrive 3 hours early due to security delays. We did; we also got checked in & through security in about 30 minutes. Having well over 2 hours we went to the United Club lounge to wait. That's where we were told that only first class travelers on international flights were permitted access! Short flights on discount fares is all United is good for any more. For comfort or luxury, Virgin, American and each European airline we've flown has had far superior service & amenities when compared to United.",-1

My flight has been delayed 4 times with a possible cancellation due to weather where the plane that I'm supposed to be on is coming from. They've told me if I do get a cancelation because of weather it's not their fault so they refuse to offer accommodations because as they said, ""I can just sleep at the airport.""

2019-07-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MCO to CLL via IAH,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no apologies or compassion,False,"  Weather delays ended up making us miss our flight connection to CLL. Rather than getting off of the flight and immediately getting on the flight to CLL, we ended up waiting ~4 hours (it’s only an hour and a half drive to CLL by the way). By the time we understood the entire situation, all of the restaurants were closing. I went up to the Customer Service, and told them the situation. They couldn’t refund or cancel the second flight, which makes sense. I asked if we could get any access to the club, though, since the restaurants had closed. They just told me no. There was no apologies or compassion for the delay, just no and that’s pretty much it. I don’t really feel like I’m a valued customer for sure. Also, their boarding times are so ridiculously long, endless flight delays, and their lowest economy class seems like a pretty cheap way for them to earn more money for something that doesn’t really make much of an impact.",-1

United put our luggage on a different flight so our luggage wasn’t at our destination. We asked the baggage services and they said that it was sent to a different destination but did not know how or when it would make it to where we are. The clerk told us to call back in a few hours so we did and they did not answer. I packed (and paid for) luggage because I intended to use it but I guess that was too much to ask.

2019-07-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Austin via Boston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,shall never fly with them again,True,"  
Houston to Austin via Boston. I visited the US for a 3 week holiday June - July 2019. I flew United thrice. How many times did I experience delays? Thrice. Once upon connecting to my final destination upon arriving in the United States. There was a delay with my flight leaving Auckland. Touching down in Houston, I had 50 minutes to clear immigration, pick up and drop bags, and leg it to the gate. I didn't like my chances. I tried not to fret. I asked Border Security/United Representatives at every opportunity, 'My flight was delayed, I'm concerned I won't make my connection, can you please advise the gate staff that I'm cutting it fine."" Every time met with: ""Ma'am, don't worry, don't panic, you'll be fine."" By some divineness, I made it to the gate with 20 minutes till departure! But United decided to close the door on myself and 20+ other travellers... such is. Had to wait 4 hours for the next flight, it was to Austin! Would have been quicker walking. Less than a week later. Austin - Boston via Houston. I was dreading going via Houston again! Once scarred. Long story short. Arrived at the airport nice and early, only for my flight to be delayed by several hours. I was extremely nervous, as I had a commute to make to Cape Cod after arriving in Boston..Needless to say, I arrived in Boston late, and had to travel by Uber (very costly) instead of the bus had United been on time! My last experience with United will remain my last, I shall never fly with them again. I am a conscientious, well-prepared, seasoned traveller, and shall not be reduced to anxiety because I know the time constraints and flying United releases me of any sense of control I feel whilst travelling whatsoever. My return flight home to Australia was a long connection of 6 flights (5 connections), guess which was my third flight and the only one with a delay?? United: Never again. I won't even elaborate on the unfriendly staff, the lack of amenities, the cost of checked in luggage, the cramped seating. Budget Airlines exist in Australia, but my delays with them lie far and few between. To experience 3 delays in a 3 week period with the same airline at the SAME airport? Beggars belief. Do yourself a favour-  United: never.",-1

2019-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York LaGuardia to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,This Airline is horrible,True," Do not use United Airlines. I had a 6am flight from New York to Hawaii with a connecting flight from Denver. Upon arrival around 8.10am my family and I proceeded to the gate where we advised that our connecting fight which should have been leaving from Denver at 9.40 am, was delayed until 1.00pm. In addition, we were assigned another gate and had to walk all the way to that location with all of our belongings. Then at 10.13 am we were advised that our flight delay had been extended to 5.00pm. I received this text message: “Your flight is delayed because of a crew scheduling disruption this morning. We know this wasn't part of your plans for today (it wasn't part of ours either), so we appreciate you hanging in there! We're doing our best to get you on your way as soon as possible”. Departure: Delayed (7 hrs 20 mins) plane-icon UA 328 Estimated: 5.00 pm Scheduled: 9.40 am. Once again, our gate has been changed and we have to lug all of our belongings to the new gate. I am beyond annoyed. This Airline is horrible. I’m traveling with my children and we have to spend the entire day in the airport. We now have to spend extra money on food for lunch which would have been included in our resort. The customer service is beyond long with people complaining of flight delays. If you want to get to your destination without delays because of ""crew scheduling disruption"" or any other issues choose another airline.",-1

The weather wasn't even an issue, nearly passable as light rain. Gate staff didn't say much, poor English skills too. Processing customers for alternatives was also snail-slow. Awful unqualified, useless staff. Captain was sarcastic, the icing on the cake for an awful display. Terrible experience. Left my girlfriend waiting at another airport. Imbeciles, the whole lot of them. Never flying United again. Makes sense, all the reviews here are bad. This just in, maybe because the company sucks, and is just that, bad. Not recommended, don't book United. 1-10, the initial cheapest ticket on the market, scheduling. USA border security agent had a sense of humour that day.",-1

My original flight was supposed to depart at 3:45 p.m. when we get there there is about an hour delay, that hour turns into 2, 3, 4, 5 our flight kept getting pushed back due to weather. I totally understand that the weather is not their fault but there were flights leaving that were going to the same destination so when we tried to get on those they said they were fully booked. The staff were incredibly rude and had no information and I know that weather makes things very difficult but they would tell us completely different things from what everything else was saying. We waited in the customer service line 3 times and the first 2 times they would tell us something and 5 mins later we would get an email saying something else. When our 3:45 flight got pushed to midnight we went Back up to customer service for the 3rd time and waited for 2 hours. The 3rd time we went the man who helped us was extremely helpful and since we had long missed our connecting flight he booked us a flight first class for a flight on Monday which was the best he could do and due to the circumstances was very helpful. We finally found out that our flight had been delayed to 11:30 a.m. the next day (tomorrow) but that everyone had to go to baggage claim because the gates were closing. So there were no hotels and everyone had to sleep in baggage claim. Thankfully for us our family is just a 10 min drive away but there were people there who had been there since 9 In the morning due to a layover with nowhere to stay and no food. It was very unorganized. We lucked out due to having an amazing customer service helper but if we had someone else it could've gone another way.",-1

This was constant from purchasing tickets months prior to 30 minutes after our final given take off time. Also asked about switching seats because I'm claustrophobic and they put me in a window seat. Guy at the gate said it was full but a couple hours later (well into the most recent delay) a small family came up and requested to switch to this flight from a later one.

Again plane was delayed from 1.40 in increments of 2 hours as the desk staff came up with excuse after excuse. Mechanical issues that created more mechanics issues. They found the part. Installed it but it just tripped the whole planes power. Really? Do you really think customers are that stupid? Clearly. Basically what they are doing is stalling for time because the flight crew work on legal turn around max times. So next they put us up in hotel - Crown Plaza - because a new plane will arrive for an unscheduled flight time of 9 am.  Manage to drag myself up for the 9am flight only to be told the plane has been delayed due to mechanical issues. Now they are flying a crew in from the US to fix the problem. You see the logic problem with this. It’s not even possible! So now they have another plane coming in - they haven’t got any brand new planes. There is no excuse for an airline to be this dreadful. The upside was one great desk worker who was so good. Professional. Calm. I just wanted to hang out with her and while away the time. So here I am again waiting for the next lie.,-1
2019-07-07,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Denver,4.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,Shame on you UA,True," Vancouver to Denver. I have to wonder what United airlines in Vancouver is thinking when it comes to customer service! Upon arriving to the Vancouver airport, we went through the self-service kiosk and tagged our bags. They had the wheelchairs locked up so we had to wait on someone to unlock them for my father. Then we were expected to drag our own checked bags about 75 yards to a conveyor belt where we had to load them to be sent off to the plane. This would not have been so bad except we had a wheelchair with no assistance and there were a lot of United personnel standing around talking and doing nothing. They also had everyone wait in the same line for all concourses which took quite a while. I am amazed that such a large airline would have such little customer service especially for loyalty customers (my parents) with today’s poor customer service, they will never get me as a loyalty passenger/customer. Once we arrived to our destination, I was not at all surprised that there was no wheelchair waiting for us as requested in Vancouver. With their outrageous pricing, you think UA would be able to afford better service. I will not book on United again unless they are the absolute only airline to a destination I want and even then I may need to choose another place to visit. Shame on you UA.",-1

There were three other families on this flight who also were seated in separate aisles from their children and had to navigate being a part-time flight attendant and ask people to switch seats. Twelve people crowding the aisle trying to ask strangers to get up. It’s annoying.

I'm typing this as my connecting flight is leaving while I sit on the tarmac because United can't schedule their flights appropriately to save their lives. This airline is truly the worst and no matter what the reason they make you miss your flight it's never their fault and you won't get a refund no matter how bad they screw up. This airline is complete trash and has ruined a vacation for me for the last time. To hell with United, the only thing they're United in is their uncanny ability to screw over their patrons.",-1

First, my flights were delayed by more than 7 hours due to “weather” (a false excuse given that there was no inclement weather at my location or destination for many hours). After my second flight was canceled, I found an agent and asked to have myself re booked to the 7am flight the following day. However, the exceedingly snippy agent was very difficult and unhelpful. When I finally got her to confirm that I would be on that flight, she then made a stink about getting my bag off of the plane. It took over 3 hours to get my bag, which only even happened because a kind baggage attendant took it on herself to help me (agents were refusing customers service and this happened to several others). Once I had left the terminal, I was informed that there would be no flights the following day, and that I would have to wait yet another day to get to my destination. I infuriatingly accepted this compromise. Yet the next day, I learned that an agent had gone into the system, and labeled me as a “no show” for a flight that was scheduled for the following day! I hadn’t shown up to a flight that hadn’t even happened yet! My seat was given to another customer, and United never gave any indication that they had canceled my reservation, kept my money, and had no intention of taking me to my destination even after costing me two extra days of my limited vacation. This is theft, plain and simple.",-1
2019-07-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Washington,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2,Our bags were missing,False,"  Zurich to Washington. Our bags were missing when we arrived at Dulles international airport. We filled out a claim. The next day we called them and checked the status of our baggage but both the page and the computer voice that we were calling couldn’t tell us the current status of our bags. They just told us that the team was working on it and that they would give us more information if they could. Our baggage didn’t arrive even after 24 hours and they couldn’t tell us were the bags were at. All my medicine was in the bag, the gifts for my host-family which I hadn’t seen for a year and so on and I had to buy all new clothes for myself. We wanted to enjoy Independence Day but because of the missing bags we couldn’t and had to shop new clothes. Worst service!",-1

2019-07-03,0.6,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Newark to London,5.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,3,inconsistency of service,True,"  Newark to London. United's new app works really well, great for check-in, changing flights, buying internet, changing seats etc I download boarding passes and was through TSA Pre-check swiftly at EWR. Polaris Lounge excellent, reasonable food offering, quality drinks, nice shower room. Lounge was very crowded from 4pm, few seats, lines for bathroom but staff pleasant. UA boarding process was usual disorganised haphazard free-for-all with pre-board groups jostling around the gate. Plane was a retro-fitted 767-300er. Polaris business seats, comfortable, private and great to sleep on, work or watch a movie. Then you hit United's Achilles heel 'inconsistency of service' from its FA's. Some crews are professional and just know about customer service while others seem to think passengers are something to be tolerated and no-longer have a passion for their jobs. I asked the FA serving the Polaris cabin for a pre-departure drink and was told that they were not offering this service from EWR as all passengers had to board through the front left door, and thats what my seat had a bottle of water. ??? After take-off I requested the express dine so I could get to sleep quickly, when the first drinks service came I request two drinks a G&T and a glass of wine for my meal. The same FA I had requested a pre-departure drink from said 'she had her eye on me' loudly to the purser, which I found funny as I hadn't even secured a single drink at that stage. When United launched Polaris over two years ago there was a real effort to improve onboard food and beverage unfortunately any improvement hasn't lasted, and as the hard Polaris product in seats and lounges slowly arrives the on-board product has declined. The food was inedible, beef that was as hard as a rock and a wet watery mash potato, present like at a cheap diner. when desert was offered the same purser and FA asked me to identify if it was a coconut or apple pie? When I was waiting near the galley to use the bathroom I heard the purser say 'give me that brown goo. these people will eat any xxxx'. United 9-10 for improvements to your hard product but you need to focus on improving inflight customer service 3-10.",1
2019-07-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Amsterdam,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,find that no baggage arrived,True,  I flew from San Francisco to Cairo through Amsterdam. I arrived in Cairo to find that no baggage arrived. I filed a claim in Cairo airport and all time was thinking it is their mistake in Cairo. When United finally answered after almost 36 hours of trying to reach them and being out on ridiculous times of hold they figured that all my baggage is still in SFO and did not leave with me. United reply was simply ridiculous that it happens and it is not their mistake and that they will forward my baggage to Cairo and have no answer to why it happened. Add to this that they outsource their calls overseas to employees that don’t have answers to your questions. This is by far the worst airline I traveled on and they don’t care. Unfortunately they were only able to find 3 of our 4 bags and forward them to our locations but they were not able to find the last bag which was my 9 months old daughter bag with her medications. The customer service was really horrible and subpar compared to any other airlines and the employee was rude claiming it is not their mistake and that they get a lot of calls which is a horrible excuse.,-1
2019-07-01,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to New York,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I left the office disenchanted,True,"  I booked the flight from Grand Rapids to Newark (NY) on June 19th 11:30 am. While at the gate we found out that first there was a delay for 12:08. At 12:15 the gate personnel came announced that there was a technical issue and the flight was cancelled. She asked everybody to go to the front office and rebook another flight. I immediately headed to the front desk and tried to find an alternative. I was told by United airlines staff that there was no flight until the next day and that would take me to New York late afternoon. That was not good enough for me as I had a 18:00 job interview on June 19th and a meeting early morning June 20th. So, I asked for alternatives. The person at the front desk said there was no other alternative and suggested to refund the cost of the ticket. My checking with American and Delta confirmed the same. She immediately put the refund request in United’s system. I was very disappointed and immediately started calling all the necessary people and try and re-schedule the job interviews.When I arrived back home I called the hotel I had booked and asked for possible cancellation of my booking. The hotel immediately denied refund as it was last minute but finally asked for a letter of flight cancellation from United so that they can possibly consider. I called United customer service and after half an hour of waiting, they directed me to a webpage where I could ask for a full refund of the hotel cost as well aside from the flight cost. I stayed on the phone to do exactly what they directed me to do and attached the hotel bill on that form. As soon as I finished the call my wife called me (I had notified her earlier) and she told me that the flight was en route to Newark. She asked me to check the google flight status. I did and I saw that the flight was reported en-route to Newark. I tried to call the airport but to no avail. I decided to go back and find out what happened. At the airport I asked the employee who told me that the flight was cancelled and suggested the refund but she avoided me saying she never suggested a refund to me or said that the flight was cancelled. Then I asked for the supervisor, who aggressively tried to lead me to the side of the office and avoided offering any explanation He aggressively asked me to wait in an office with a young employee who knew nothing and just waited there for 10 mins without anything happening. I asked for the name of the person who refunded my ticket and the name of the supervisor but she denied offering them and called security. Needless to say I was extremely polite and respectful to all. I told her that it was not necessary as I only wanted to file a complaint with United (as I saw there was no way for me to fly and would like to have the names of the employees involved.) Security came and offered the name of the supervisor but not the name of the employee who cancelled my ticket. I left the office disenchanted. After three days of talking to UA customer service I finally managed to get a letter on June 21st which I forwarded to the Hotel in NY. After another three days of back and forth the hotel finally declined reimbursing me the money (USD 584) because “it was last minute”. UA reimbursed only the cost of the ticket.",-1

I had to pay to check in a carry on bag due to the type of ticket I bought ( This is understandable). The problem however was when I landed and couldn’t find my bag, I waited till all the luggage’s were delivered and at this point I thought someone must have stolen my luggage until someone suggested I go talk to the United baggage office. On getting there , the attendant told me my bag didn’t come on the same flight I arrived with and is scheduled to arrive at 10:30pm . I told her i had my house and car keys in my bag and her reply was “ who checks in their house keys on a flight”. The sad part was United didn’t think it was necessary to notify passengers about the status of their luggage. How do you send a text when a flight start boarding but can’t do the same when a passengers flight is missing? I was given a file number and pretty much told to wait till the flight arrives or have them deliver it around midnight to my house. I will be stuck at a neighbors house till then.",-1

The flight was scheduled on 6:30 from Boston to Chicago. It got delaied for 3 hours and we lost our connection flight to Lansing. The responsible United people were very rude and their only option was to provide the next flight to Lansing with 24 hours delay. All staying and delay costs are on our own.

We were supposed to reach Newark by 10 am est and it’s already 4.30 pm est and we are stuck in Chicago. There are no updates from United and the staff is very rude whenever we ask a question. We missed the tour which was going to start at 10 am from Newark. My son is totally devastated as he was looking forward to this trip. I’ll never ever fly with United again.,-1

Between United ticketing service, TSA and the gate personnel there were 20 passengers that did not make the flight to Chicago and we got no help from the person at the ramp. We were all left to scramble to rebook flights to Chicago so we could try and make our final destinations. For me and my wife. When we got to the ticket kiosk to print our boarding passes we were told there was an error so we had to go up to the ticket counter and we were left on hold for 15 minutes or more before the issue was resolved then we had to go through TSA check which was completely backed up. Consequently, we just made it to the gate when they close the door and the attendant would not even call the plane or do anything to help. We did a head count and there were 20 passengers total that had missed the flight.",-1
2019-06-30,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,3,made sure my wife and I sat separately,False,"  It has been a long time since we flew United. When you choose the low cost flight option, you get the clear message that you are a second class citizen. You can't check in online, because they want to verify that we don't have more than a personal item. They went as far as to ask my wife to turn around at the kiosk, so they could confirm she didn't have more than a back sack. You are the last group to board the plane and they made sure my wife and I sat separately and in middle seats in both directions. We asked at checkin about getting seats together and their personnel made it clear this was not possible with the low cost fair. If I had known this was their practice, I would have chose differently or chose another airline. Most of this frustration was due to ignorance, I will be able to make a better informed decision next time. Their staff was professional and friendly. There are other airlines targeting low cost airline services, but they provide a more positive experience.",-1

Every 30 mins there is a new excuse to why we have to wait again! I have a major fear of flying and the trip home makes me never want to fly again. Shame on you United, my flight was set for 1:45, we boarded at 1:20 they left us in the cabin with a broken AC, no water and glued to our seats for 1.5 hours and counting!

",True," This a warning for those selecting Premium Economy Plus on United (not to be confused with Econ Plus). Completely Shady, but more like a scam. First, I haven’t taken the flight yet, but feel the need to share. I was selecting seats on a code share operated by United. 1) Selected seats on the window side to be more comfortable because the cabin offers 2 seats on either side with 4 in the middle 777 300er. 2) Immediately following the process a ‘special’ upgrade offer was presented for the low price of $268: click here to pay and select seats. 3) The kicker was the offer was a downgrade to Economy Plus that offers a few extra inches of leg room in the economy cabin, yes big difference from Econ Premium Plus and Econ Plus. For those that don’t know, int’l Premium Plus is basically the same seats used for Domestic first class. Econ Plus only provides a little extra legroom near the front of the Economy cabin United should be ashamed. This about tops anything I’ve dealt with on Domestic US carriers. Another reason to stay away. My fault I didn’t catch the return flight was Air New Zealand, but the least reputable legacy carrier in the US.",-1

Wasted Taxi an hour back to the airport to get luggage as they promised it was now there, it was not. Hours on the phone trying to rebook, trying to track luggage, and then trying to file claims. Hours on hold! Hours speaking to people who had no clue. Worst customer service ever! We will never, ever, fly with United again. You are taking a risk. We were unaware of their reputation with delayed/cancelled flights and lost luggage. We learned the hard way.",-1

They have zero respect to their customers. The check in agent and ground staff were rude and lazy. We had been treated with grumpy faces and such attitude. I was asking for a senior assistance for my grandmother who doesn’t speak English and under no circumstance that I expected to receive a straight face with the rudest response ‘that is not our responsibility that your grandma doesn’t speak English’. Understanding my grandmother might not qualify for the help but they didn’t have to respond in such unprofessional and uneducated way. We did not beg for the free flight, if you are unable to provide a basic service with courtesy then just shut your business.",-1

This was a very nice act that deserves to be shared as an example to other airlines who need to consider that there is always a family behind that passenger that is left out.,1

This airline can’t handle any change of weather or slight change of schedule without significant delay. It doesn’t help that Newark, one of the worst airports in the world, is their hub. I’m one of the elite flyers who hates United for their lack of ability to handle any problems arise. There was some rain briefly this morning but the flight delayed and we were stuck on tarmac for 3 hours without food or water. They didn't even turn on the wifi. I’m going to miss the connecting flight and was rebooked to late flight at the end of the day. By the time I will get to my destination, the rental car counter will be closed. I’ve flown United 4 times in the past few weeks (I travel for work) and it rarely ever gets anywhere or departs on time. But the worst thing is their handling of problems.",-1

Plus its summer travel season. But this time I’ve had enough. Flight just got cancelled and moved from Monday to Wednesday. Pretty much we were stripped down 2 vacation days and missed the occasion that we planned attending. Then, we were put on different seats (but I paid extra when made reservations). Going back from Buffalo to Portland was another hassle. Flight from BUF was delayed, we barely made it to our connection (had to run through Chicago O’Hare). Got on the plane, had to sit and wait for our turn to take off. Took us 1.5 hours. Couldn’t use the bathroom. When we were finally able to take off, we weren’t allowed to use the restroom for another 1.5 hours. Crying kids. Angry passengers. This is not OK! Never ever I will use United again.",-1
2019-06-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Savannah to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,would they please move us,True,"  Savannah to Newark. On a recent United flight (UA 138) that I had booked in February 2019 for a Flight on 24. June 2019, the following happened to me and other passengers, please note that several other groups of passengers experienced the same thing on this flight and have reported to have seen the same practice on other flights as well. I was traveling with my two underage children ages 13 and 15. I was placed in Row 12E while my children were both placed in Row 20, which is an Exit row. Note that my 15 year old is old enough to sit in this row and assist other passengers in an emergency but my 13 year old is most certainly not and cannot sit there per FAA regulations. When I stated that we need to moved elsewhere the flight employees told me to just switch seats with the 13 year old. Subsequently I protested and informed the flight employees that none of us want to sit in an Exit row, even though I am old enough, I do not want to sit in an Exit neither. My 13 year was subsequently moved to row 12E and I was left without a seat. Finally I was told to move to the back of the airplane Row 34 ‘somewhereʼ (no specific seat was given to me) and my 15 year old was left in the Exit row on his own. At this point I switched with another passenger at the front row 7 which was closer to my children than Row 34. The Stewardess on this Flight then informed me this is also an Exit row. (She later remarked that since I called her a ‘Stewardess’ I do not fly very often. Despite the fact I’m in the air every month. She really went out of her way to be insulting.) I repeated the fact that I donʼt want to sit in any exit rows and I want my second child also moved away from the Exit row. I repeated that I believed that itʼs FAA regulations that we must agree to sit there and agree to assist or be moved and would they please move us. At this point the Stewardess started to get very aggravated and said ‘we offered you a seat in the back‘ and you didnʼt take it and subsequently switched me again from Row 7C to 8C. She rolled her eyes an also stated that ‘here we go again, acting demeaning and rude. I didnʼt ‘buyʼ a seat that means they can put me wherever, even in an exit row- apparently even without my consent. I would like to add here that I very much liked to have bought assigned seats; however the first opportunity I got in the entire purchase / check-in process was two hours before boarding when all the seats for sitting together already were taken. In summary my 13 year old was placed into Row 12E and my 15 year old was in an exit Row 20 the entire flight although he was a minor and I did not agree for him to sit there. Finally in the last 30 minutes I approached the staff again to re-seat us. Furthermore security measures ask for parents to assist children during a flight with oxygen masks as well as ensure that seatbelts are worn between and after bathroom breaks. How can a parent assure that this happens properly when the parent is placed on the opposite side of the airplane with isles blocked by carts and other people? In my case this was not as big of a deal as my children are teenagers but there was another group of passengers where the parent was split from a 6 year old child and the child was expected to basically fly on their own? She was crying and was not allowed to be seated next to her parent.",-1

Always trying to take advantage of the customers by creating dumb policies. I've never had any problems passing through with my backpack but now United wants to charge me money for my backpack. The main reason that I bought a backpack is to carry it myself. United is a low class and cheap airline trying to take even the last dime from every customer and they don't even serve nothing in 4 hour flights. I'm disgusted by this airline.,-1

This is hands down the worst airline to ever exist! My family and I were heading to LAX for a connecting flight to Kauai, but the plane we boarded had this clunking noise under our feet. The crew didn’t bother to call maintenance until everyone was on board and we were delayed by 30 minutes. Once that was finished, we were delayed again because of the paperwork. So we were behind schedule by one hour! We did make it to LAX, but the crew didn’t bother to let those off who had connecting flights that were leaving in a few minutes. Honestly United, you could’ve called maintenance before everyone got on board, but you tortured us with this stupid problem that you obviously wanted to share. So, in the future I will not be flying United.",-1

I purchased a round trip ticket valued at $1,435 only to find out the day of my first flight that one leg of my trip was never ticketed. I had to call United Customer Service to get the issue resolved. They representative told me that the flight was full and there was nothing that could be done. On my return trip, I was told again that two of my legs were not ticketed. So basically I purchased a ticket that was not even real. Customer Service did not offer to help me or compensate me in anyway. I’m not sure why an large airline such as United cannot handle ticketing it’s own tickets.",-1

United was delayed for over 4 hours and I was only notified while checking in at the airport. (3 hours prior because it was an international flight) I arrived at the airport at 5 am and had been up since 3 am already. The plane was then delayed a total of 4 times pushing it a total of 4 hours late. Upon my arrival to Toronto, I was told that I do not have a flight home. I was on standby as no one from any united desk would assist me. My daughter called United and they stated I had to either wait standby or take a flight the next morning and could not be simultaneously on standby and hold a ticket for the next day. They also could not guarantee any overnight accommodations, stating that I would need to leave the secured area go to the ticketing booth and tell them your new confirmation number, and at that point they would decide whether or not I would receive any overnight accommodations. I was supposed to be home by 130pm, but Instead I came home the following day at 130am as I made the last standby plane. United airlines is not helpful nor is their staff and ultimately it was their fault I was delayed and this resulted in me missing my connecting flight. I was not reimbursed or aided in any way. Worst trip I’ve had in years. Bottom line up front, I fly frequently and will not be utilizing or recommending their services to anyone whatsoever.",-1

The flight from New Orleans to Houston flight time at first kept getting earlier so we weren't able to do the final vacation things we wanted to do, then when we got there the flight got delayed many times. We decided to switch flights to go from New Orleans to San Francisco then from there to Seattle. They decided to put us on a flight that had been delayed for 12 hours. It was supposed to leave around 6am and left 6pm. Not only that but our luggage was very much so mistreated and were not offered drinks on our flight. We were completely dismissed. When we landed and went to get our luggage we found out it was still in San Francisco and had to get it the next morning. I am severely frustrated with the airline and will no longer fly the ""friendly skies"" with them.",-1

No one wants to sit on the runway for 45 minutes just to be told we have to head back to the gate, but before we go to the gate we have to sit some more and wait. There’s always delays and something is always wrong. United Airlines cause many people to miss their connecting flights which is a drag and very inconvenient.",-1

I have to start off saying that when booking a flight a lot of times there is uncertainty because there is so much that you have to prepare for, but working with United Airlines customer service was the best customer service experience that I have ever had. In particular working with Lauren was so awesome.She helped my military family get everything we needed for our trip to Hawaii. She made sure that each one of my kids will be taken care of before we board the plane and she also made sure that we saved money along the way as well. Like I said before one of the best experiences with customer service ever, and I thank United Airlines for letting me speak with Lauren. Fantastic job!",1

We were supposed to have a simple 2hr flight to NYC from Chicago. We were delayed for hours for mechanical issues and then finally moved to the next day. We were unable to talk to anyone over the phone or at the United desk for 2hrs in line & on hold. When we finally did talk to a rep they were not friendly and could care less. They then gave us meal vouchers that did not work and we were unable to get our bags back for the overnight stay at the crappy airport hotel... Now we're out the money for the hotel we booked in NYC as well. Like I said just don't even mess with this disaster of an airline or their very poor customer service.",-1
2019-06-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Monroe to Elmira,,,,,,1.0,1,not allowing my mother to board,True,"  Monroe to Elmira. I am beyond frustrated with United from the Unprofessionalism in telling someone they only needed to be there 30 min before the flight (she hadn't flown in over 10yrs) and closed the door (15min before flight) not allowing my mother to board, MLU rescheduled and confirmed her for the next flight out which was today 6/20/19 (the following day). In the mean time my husband googled United and spoke to someone in booking to see if they could get her on the 340pm flight later that day on 6/19, we were told no by the supervisor. The supervisor stated she could book my mother on the next flight out which she was already booked on the next flight out by the airport on 6/20 which the supervisor saw and verbally confirmed with us, we asked if we could upgrade the flight to see if we could get her on the later flight on 6/19 and was told no because she had an economy ticket, so we accepted our fate that we were just gonna have to lose a day with her and accepted the flight that was rebooked to 6/20 at 530am. The supervisor asked for my email address so I could receive my mother's new itinerary, my husband spelled out my email address character by character so we know they had the right email address, but I never received an email! After that phone call transpired the supervisor without permission changed her already booked flight from 6/20 to Friday 6/21 and never told us or notified us. If they had sent me the itinerary I could've caught the mistake made by United (for the second time) and got it straighten out before my mother's flight this morning. When she got to the airport this morning even tho she had her ticket in hand she was told she couldn't board because she wasn't on the manifest. Now, I'm missing 2 days with my Mother who I haven't seen in 9yrs who hasn't seen her grandkids in that long one of which she's hasn't met yet and she's missing my son's graduation tomorrow morning. I'm beyond frustrated with United and feel the flight needs to be honored and a refund returned. My mother showed up 2 days in a row and was denied her flight because of the unprofessionalism and incompetent employees. This should have never happened.",-1

I was supposed to arrive in Denver last night. I sat at the airport with my family for 3 hours only to be sent back home due to “flight crew needing rest”. We got rebooked to this morning and have already been delayed 2 times. They have no compensation for your time spent, money spent on reservations already paid for at your destination, time taken off work, etc. This airline has no regard for your travel plans. Our flight has only been delayed for either “flight crew needs rest” or “no flight crew available”. This is insane and preposterous.",-1

Montréal to Savannah via Newark. Worst trip of my life. Our first flight got canceled for scheduled crew problem. Our new first flight got delayed. Our second flight got canceled. We arrived in Newark at 11 pm, had to be back at the airport at 5 am and according to the airline, the only hotel available was at a 60 minutes drive. We found ourselves and paid for it a much more closer hotel and cheaper. Every personnel would only help for a small of our problem. It really was a bad experience and we lost a whole day of a short vacation..",-1

My original flight was supposed to be from Boise to Denver to Newark to San Juan. I ended up getting on my on-time flight to Denver, but due to “weather” we were flown to Grand-Junction airport. This runway is not FAA approved and so when we landed something broke and there ended up being a mechanical issue that further delayed us an extra 9 hours in that airport. I also have Celiac disease and I was not accommodated any gluten-free food. So after about 9 hours of sitting in that terminal, we boarded a different plane and flew to Denver. I then had to change my connecting flight completely because of the delay, and it added an extra connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale. Once I landed there I was rushing to my gate. When I finally arrived in Newark I was so exhausted, and hungry I had a complete meltdown. I missed my connecting flight to San Juan by 10 minutes, and ended up having to wait another 11 hours in the Newark airport. Altogether, I was in the airport/flying for about 48 hours straight, with no accommodations. Now that I am trying to get back to Boise Idaho, I am again having issues. I tried to check-in to my flight on the app about 20 hours before my expected flight time, and it said I was “unable to check-in at this time.” So I called to see what the problem was and I was on hold for 1.5 hours. When they finally answered they said that they accidentally put in the system “did not show up to board.” This was crazy to me because my flight hadn’t even taken off yet. So he finally fixed that issue and now that I have checked in and am currently at the SJU airport, my flight is delayed 9 hours so far. I am absolutely frustrated and would never recommend this airline to anyone.",-1

Cabin service was terrible and there wasn't a self serve bar. United also had a terrible meal and can never compete with Asian airlines. Singapore Airlines is way better. I don't get what's going on with United Airlines but it's just really bad. The seat was so uncomfortable and the flight attendants didn't care about us in any way. They were just in the back chatting about their own ""things."" All in all, it's a terrible airline for economy. However, I will be a silver member soon and I hope the premium economy and the business class are better.",-1

I believe United did a much better job on this trans-Pacific flight than when I last flew with them to Cancun in 2015. Overall, the food was good and they even allowed me to explore the cockpit. However, there were certain things United needs to improve on. The seat comfort was not that great and there is a lack of variety of inflight entertainment, and I was left with other things to do for 2 hours of my flight. But overall, it was OK! Well done United!",1
2019-06-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Albuquerque,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Stuck in Houston on standby,False,"  United Airlines delayed a flight from Houston to Austin due to over filling the fuel tank, the airplane was already on the runway when they had to stop it before departing. This caused an hour delay for the flight from Austin to the connecting flight out of Houston. They knew this flight was delayed and why it was delayed. When we landed the other flight had started boarding, and so I ran 1.5 miles to make it to my connecting flight. I ran up as they shut the doors. The ticketing agent knew that the flight was delayed and why it was and still they didn't hold the flight. They put me and twenty others on standby with full flights. They could of just held the plan for 10 minutes and there would of been no issues. No wonder they only got two stars out of five. I give them zero out of five because it wouldn't have been too hard to hold for 10 minutes. On top of that the standby flight we had to wait fifteen minutes for a crew member. I still didn't get on that fight. Stuck in Houston on standby, and I was told I was first on standby but the list has me as fourth, liars!",-1
2019-06-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Austin to Honolulu,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,know absolutely nothing about customer service,False,  United Airlines is by far the worst airline I’ve ever travelled with. They know absolutely nothing about customer service. I am flying from Austin to Honolulu today and I was supposed to have a connecting flight in Denver. I received a text last night saying that the flight to Denver had been delayed. I was supposed to leave Austin at 7.25am and now I can’t leave until 9.14am. That is a problem because I’m supposed to leave Denver at 9.40am to go to Honolulu. Apparently there are no direct flights from Denver to Honolulu after the one I was supposed to be on. So now I have to have another connecting flight from Denver to Los Angeles. The flight from Los Angeles departs at 2pm and I won’t get to Honolulu until 5pm! This messes up all my reservations for when I land in Honolulu because I will be arriving 4 hours after the time I was supposed to. The two customer services ladies at gate 27 in Austin this morning were completely rude to me and said that they’re not going to do anything about it and I’m just out of my money on my reservations!,-1

If you are not going to treat people with dignity remove basic economy class. Won’t allow me to check in. I had to show an employee I don’t have a carry on. Put me next to the restroom even though there were several empty seats.  I asked flight attendant for Dr Pepper, she walked away saying they didn’t have it and made a nasty comment to the next customer “I don’t know why people ask for things we don’t carry”. She should not be working, period. I used to be commuter on Continental and Texas air prior to that. Merging with United was awful. This airline should not exist.",-1

Multiple people on the flight have asked why our flight is delayed at the counter worker was useless, essentially just waving off the customer. Our flight was supposed to leave at 8:23 pm and has now been pushed back for 2 hours. They continue to give fake answers over the intercom to why we haven’t left. The plane has been in the terminal for over 3 hours yet they pretend that the crew isn’t there. It would be different if they were honest to why we haven’t left yet but that is not the case.",-1

2019-06-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago via Jackson Hole,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline customer service,True,"  Worst airline in regards to flight attendants and customer service. First of all, it was just me and my 16 month old, along with a stroller, a carry on bag, and a personal item. First flight was delayed over an hour and the attendants could not tell me why or resolve the issue--the issue being: I would have 5 minutes to get on my connecting flight in Chicago! Please keep in mind--it is just me and my baby traveling. Once we boarded the first flight from ATL to Chicago, I asked the flight attendant if she knew the status of my next flight going from Chicago to Jackson Hole and what gate it would be at since I would nearly be making the flight due to their delay. She said they could not get that information and had no way to access it! HAHA! I have a flip phone but found out from other guy attendant that he could access that info on the United website with wifi. He did so for me. But that's all he did, the bare minimum. Also, there were 3-4 rows of open seats in which I could of sat with my baby on any other airline since they were open but no.  Also, was told wrong gate on first flight by guy. Then when getting off in Jackson Hole and I asked staff  for assistance in getting my carryon bag from overhead because I was clearly not able to while holding my child, he said, ""I'm not allowed to do that.""",-1
2019-06-14,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to San Francisco,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,perfectly pleasant,True," London Heathrow to San Francisco return. The outbound flight was on a new (2017) 777-300 and the aircraft was smart and clean. Seats were a little narrow given the 3-4-3 configuration, but lots of airlines are now using this in economy for the 777. The seat was comfy enough and offered good back support. Blanket and pillow provided. Entertainment screen was a good size and had a lot of content which was impressive. Mine needed resetting during the flight but after asking the cabin crew this was done no problem. Service was good with beer and wine included but other alcoholic drinks needing extra paymemt. Food was ok although a little unhealthy. The service before landing was only started with around 45 mins of the flight left so was a huge rush which wasn't very relaxing. WiFi was available to buy but I didn't use it. The flight was on time. Return Flight was as above, apart from older (1999) 777-200. Refurbished aircraft had the same seat as above and entertainment too. Was pleasant enough. The flight was around 35 mins late arriving in LHR, however, someone was there to meet those with connections so good service. The crew were good, service was less rushed on this flight. The flight was full and still comfy enough. Again the entertainment screen needed resetting but not a problem was done in 10 mins. Food better than the outbound leg. Again didn't pay for any WiFi. Slept for 5 hours or so. Having seen some bad review of United I am leaving a review as they were perfectly pleasant. I would reccomend!",1

Delayed by weather and had to run to connection flight. Got there with 3 kids and was told we couldn’t board even though the plane was still at the gate. Once door was closed and I mean she closed the door in front of me and my family. Then we had to stand in a customer service line for hours to get rerouted. On the way back we had the rudest stewardess who slammed the cart on my arm and leg I swear on purpose. I say that because I asked her to help get my screen going 3 times and she was no help so I had no movie screen for the 9 hour flight. We made it safely which is first and foremost of most importance but we slammed the ground and did a bunny hop until we came to a complete stop. Needless to say this will be the last time I ever fly United Airlines. By the way, I never write reviews but this trip was just that ... a trip!",-1

My flight that I purchased says it lands from Redding in San Francisco at 12pm, and my next flight leaves at 12:50pm. My flight got changed on the dayto 11pm. That's like a 10 hour wait. I tried to ask why it was changed, the customer service rep said they ""cant tell me why."" What does that even mean? Also, they said there are absolutely no other flights going from San Fran to MSP between 1pm-11pm. So there are no United airlines airplane flying AT ALL? They offered to change my flight for $200.

So I was overwhelmed with the fact we got into Houston late and missed my connecting flight but luckily the customer service rep by the name of Michelle was so kind and professional - she calmed my nerves and made this disaster comforting.

2019-06-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Huntsville,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1, I am not flying United again,True,"  This is the worst airline ever. Flights are constantly delayed causing you to miss connecting flights. They offer no accommodations that truly help your situation. You end up missing your training, conference, meeting, etc. They tell you to use their code to book a hotel. And might I add that said hotel is at your expense because they cannot control weather. In turn now you have to pay more money more for a car rental (date changes/modifications) because of rate changes or risk being a no show for your rental and have it completely cancelled. It costs way to much money to miss a flight. Ridiculous! Can I just add that I will be informing my employer to switch back to Delta as our primary airline. Also, I experienced a flight delay back in January but did not know until I arrived at the airport to check in. I am not flying United again.",-1
2019-06-10,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Portland,2.0,,4.0,,,2.0,3,staff should learn more manners,True,"  We, a family of three, flew UA1572 on 25/05/19 between Newark to Portland The check-in was made prior to arrival at the airport but faced a very long queue for baggage processing at the airport. We have three pieces of luggage to check and after very long waiting the machine did not print out the baggage tag for our third one and then it stopped working. We got help from a staff member after she took a long time helping the others who are quite uncomfortable with the system. After that we took our three pieces of luggage to the drop-off point. One of ours is 2.2 lbs above the limit. The staff, however, looked at me like I am a criminal and didn’t say a word or give any suggestions. No communication! I had to ask her what I should do and the answer is that we either need to remove some of the excess or pay for it. We chose the former and my wife did this task. In the meantime, she asked me ""where's X?"" (which is my wife), my answer is thus to point to her but that staff bluntly spoke to me that she needs the passport not the person. I think that this is bad taste or even rude and there's no customer centred service mind. We finally managed the weight issues and got all passed. The inflight service is OK with a rather friendly flight attendant. I'd suggest that if check-in can be made out of the airport why doesn’t baggage tag print can be done at the same time at home and we just tap the QR code at the check-in to get tags? This would allow more time for customers to be less clumsy and less time consuming. To me, some of the UA staff should learn more manners. We pay for their service and salaries and we are not paying to do self-service with rude manners. Currently, it's not that easy to differentiate UA form the low-cost airlines since everything is burdened upon us. The difference is thus it's higher in costs with similar or poorer service.",-1
2019-06-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Norfolk via Chicago,2.0,,,,,3.0,1,I was humiliated and stranded,True,"  Los Angeles to Norfolk via Chicago. Over the years I have been increasingly dissatisfied with the customer service of United Airlines employees. So far I haven't really had an issue with flight attendants but the counter staff seem to be getting worse with every trip I take. This trip I was actually on an American Airlines flight that was cancelled and was rebooked on a United Airlines flight by AA. My original flight was to be at 7:00 am. I was rebooked on a 10:20 am flight on UA. I went directly to UA customer service once AA had given me the informatiom via text and email. The UA staff have me what looked like a boarding pass but told me that I had to go to the gate counter to get a seat assignment before I could board. I did and proceeded to sit and wait for at least an hour after that. I boarded with the appropriate boarding group and proceeded to my seat to buckle up. Just before the doors were closed, I was called to the front and told to bring my carry ons. They proceeded to tell me I couldn't fly because they hadn't gotten the confirmation from AA. They brought my suitcase up, stood it on the floor, shoved it to roll over to me and said come on, we have to close the door. I realize a mistake had been made by AA, but I felt that if there was a problem with my reservation, there was plenty of time to realize this in the over 2-1/12 hours from when the reservation had been made to when I was kicked off the plane. If the customer service agent had indicated any problem I would have had time to resolve it. If the gate agent has mentioned it when he assigned me a seat - both instances would have allowed me to correct the situation. I can't describe it, but after the stress of the morning, and the attitude of the gate attendant that took me off the plane I was left in tears standing outside the door. She just moved past me after locking the door and never looked back or offered any guidance on what to do. I was humiliated and stranded the second time that day. I'm going back to Southwest where they have compassion and systems that work.",-1
2019-06-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,terrible customer service,False,"  My wife and I were flying to Italy for a wedding. We started our travel from Austin, Texas to Newark, New Jersey. Our flight was delayed 3 hours in Austin and caused us to miss our connecting flight to Germany in Newark. Not a huge deal, we understand delays happen and it’s not anyone’s fault. That’s part of traveling. We spent a great amount of time at the customer service desk switching flights and making sure our baggage would be following accordingly. In order to stay in business class, the next connecting flight out wasn’t for another 24 hours, which is inconvenient, but again we understand. We passed the time in the United Polaris Club, which was  very nice. We finally made it to our final destination, Naples Italy, but our 4 bags did not. There is only one counter at the airport in Naples for all lost baggage. We filed our claim for our missing luggage and were told by the lost baggage rep that we would be updated within 24hrs with a status on our missing luggage. 24 hours passed and we decided to call the customer service number on our claim tag. We were unable to reach any baggage rep, the phone would ring and never was picked up. We tried to call the airport directly and never made it to a live rep for assistance. We called United because it was the airline we booked our reservation through. The rep kept telling us that the baggage loss was due to Lufthansa, Star Alliance Partner, so we would have to call that airline for assistance. Frustrating, but we followed the information given to us by the United rep and attempted to call Lufthansa. Lufthansa would not ever pick up the phone. 48 hours of trying to call Lufthansa, still the phone was never answered. Again, we called United for assistance with Lufthansa and the rep was unable to get the airline to answer. The United rep told us he would call us back in 1 hour with an update on our luggage. We of course waited and the call back never came. On the 72hr of still not having luggage and not a single update from either airline or the claim center, we called United once again. This time the rep was able to tell us that our bags never made it on our connecting flight from Newark to Munich and our bags where still in the United States and we scheduled on a flight to Germany and would make it to Naples Italy at 10:30 that night. The next morning we called United to make sure our luggage did make it to Italy and the rep told us we had no baggage claim submitted and we needed to file one at the airport in Italy and again we needed to call Lufthansa. After 4 days with no luggage, half of our trip, we called our chauffeur that picked us up in Italy to drive us to our villa. We asked if he had any idea how we could get in contact with anyone at the Naples airport to find out if our bags made it or were even in route. He had a driver that was picking up at the airport go to the claim and ask about our missing luggage. He was able to verify that our bags did finally arrive at the airport and a rep would be bringing them to our villa that day. At the end of day 4, we finally received our missing luggage. We understand flights get delayed and bags get lost. All we wanted was answers from United and they were unable to provide that, blaming other airlines, and providing terrible customer service. When we made it back to the United States after our trip, we tried to get in contact with the customer service department to give them the opportunity to make it right. United did not respond.",-1

Then when we are the last people to enter the flight, they don't greet us, they did not help me put my cabin bag in the cabin head and shouted at us on the airport in front of other passengers (that we will leave you and go). This is not the way a passenger is treated. And just for the information, I arrived airport 5 hours before my boarding and was on time. Very slow service and no help for the crew. I will never travel in this airline.",-1

The person who was at the boarding gate did not let me go in the airplane because of my backpack. She asked me to pay $60 with card but their card reader did not work. I am a senior lady with high blood pressure. I told her that I will lose another flight but she didn’t care. She said she can call 911 for my blood pressure instead of being helpful and resolving the issue. She was not respectful. I felt discriminated because everyone went in with bag and carry on but she didn’t let me me. My suitcase was in the airplane and I asked I need my suitcase because my blood pressure medicine is in there but she said, it is too late. My question to United Airlines is what is your customer service policy and responsibilities to your costumer. I am very unhappy and unsatisfied with United airline and will not use it anymore. Also right now I am waiting about 30 minutes over the phone to talk with a representative which still waiting on the line.",-1

First off, the planes are old the the first one we were on (an Airbus) smelled like moth balls. The second flight, a smaller plane completely screwed up our seats. When we ordered the tickets online we entered in my daughter’s birthdate (she is 3 years old) and they failed to account for the fact that she is a child and she couldn’t sit at an exit seat. When they went an fixed this, the failed to put us together as a family (there was 5 of us) and there was many seats open! We ended up sitting in the front row with tons of legroom, which is a bonus, but still! We will stick with Delta!",-1

At CYN they told us the flight was overbooked and were offering $1000 flying voucher to take a flight the next day. Finally start boarding plane and the stewardess and pilot had to count passengers 8 times to get the correct numbers. There were empty seats that they had to put luggage in because it couldn't fit under the seat. And told us there was weight issues and they had too much fuel. Got to Denver and sprinted across airport and missed connected flight by two minutes, along with 10 other individuals. Customer service line has been 50 people long for the last 2 hours. And they wouldn't compensate us for anything. Customer service said the issue was weather related but the staff in Moab was ignorant. Scheduled us a flight the next day in 15 hours. No food, no blanket, no clothes, no toothbrush. Easy to say we will no longer be flying United.",-1

This is the third time in a roll (the previous two ones were substantially delayed). The lady at the podium was very rude to everyone including me. She rebooked the next day same flight, so 24 hours late. I asked if there is earlier flight. She said no. Then, I said one gentleman got an earlier flight. She said he’s handicap and went “US has a law”, which implies I don’t know there are laws. I was already frustrated with the cancellation and she said that!",-1

I was told the plane had malfunction so that a new flight would be accommodated. I am sick and needed to get home. It took more than 24 hours to reach my destination.I was supposed flight directly. After another delay, I arrived in Miami and I was told by United Airlines that I would have to take LATAM connecting flight. My suitcase in the meantime was taken. LATAM didn't find me on the system and the send me back to your airline. The rude personal finally told me they didn't have space for me but that my suitcase was already in New York. Frustrate, I had a panic attack.  No one was kind or accommodating to me.  Customers should be taken care of. I paid over $1,000 to be on time. Customer service offered me $200 on another flight.",-1

It took my husband and I twelve hours to fly from Boise to Denver and 3 different airports. We were moved from airline to airline and they forced us to check our bags because they crammed so many people into one plane. After a 12 hour day, they lost my luggage. I finally got my luggage after 4 days. This bag had about $3k worth of equipment and clothing, makeup, etc. No one and no airline knew where it was.

I am coming back from LAX to Newark then I had to check in my bag again and not only that this time I was told that one carry on is only a small purse and that my small luggage “does not fit in the onboard luggage compartment”. Well this is just another way of taking my money and making me jump through hoops and hurtles to have a longer flight experience that is already expensive and terrible to start with.",-1

Well, we decided to give them another chance just to see of things were improved. NO! It's gotten worse! We boarded the plane, and when it was time to leave the gate, the captain announces that they can't find the first officer! They tried calling him with no luck. After 30 minutes, we were asked to depart the plane. The pilot said that in his 15 years with the airline, he has never seen anything like this. How does United stay in business? Never have had bad service with any other airline. Never again will we fly with United. We are still waiting for a First Officer to show up.  I'll add that the baggage check-in staff act like they don't like their jobs.",-1

I recently flew to Barcelona on the airline and they waited to tell us that our flight to Newark was canceled 30 minutes before take off so we hopped on another plane to get there. When we got there we found out that our flight to Barcelona was delayed by a few hours. Then when we arrived we didn’t get our luggage because they lost it so we contacted customer service and they promised it would be in by 5 pm the next day.

When checking in I asked the assistance of a United representative. The representative showed reluctance to help me and frustrated that I asked several questions and required help. The assistant told me I could not take my purse as I had a carry on bag. I did not know this was an issue before I was checking in. I was required to throw my purse away or pay $60 round trip to take my purse. I threw it away. It was a humiliating experience as I was on the floor repacking my bag with everything in my purse and that representative was rigid and frustrated with me for taking up his time. Many passengers watched this process. I was traumatized by the experience. It reminded me of other times when a person who had authority over me treated me badly showing a lack of respect and empathy. Obviously I am still impacted by his attitude and behavior two weeks later. Just a little kindness would have gone a long way.,-1
2019-05-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Flagstaff to Denver via Chicago,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,Both of flights were delayed,True,"  Flagstaff to Denver via Chicago. Both of my flights were delayed, first one from Flagstaff to Denver had a 1.5 hour delay. Was told it was a maintenance issue, and they had to call a mechanic up, which took him about an hour to get to the FLG airport. We were de-boarded and went back to the gate while we waited. I had to schedule a different connecting flight in Denver due to the first delayed flight. This flight was also delayed over six hours due to another maintenance issue. They ended up having to find another plane to fly to ORD from DEN. I heard it was a pressure issue in the cockpit, which yes that's a problem, and they couldn't fix it, hence having to find a different plane to use. What a nightmare that was! There was just minor weather from what I saw around, and I didn't hear of any other flights being delayed due to weather. I tried getting on standby and tried to catch an earlier flight but I wasn't able to get on another one. Once on the plane, no more issues at least. Seats were decent for economy class, and good service from the crew. I started this trip at 6am to leave Flagstaff by 7am, and didn't get to my destination until 2:30 am the next day. And all united could give us is a $50 voucher toward a next flight...uh, no thanks.",-1

Of my last 5 flights on this airline they have on one way or the other, cancelled or were late taking off due to maintenance. NOT weather! Disgusting. Customer service re routed me at at $500 additional cost for car rental and said this particular subsidiary was the worst in their fleet. Apparently not bad enough to require better maintenance on their aircraft. Unfortunately they are the only game in town that flies from Washington Dulles to Portland, ME",-1
2019-05-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,cranky flight crew members,False,"  Flight UA3777 from Birmingham, AL to Chicago, IL was going well until a slight delay caused some of the flight crew to be very irritable. One flight attendant was very rude during the boarding process and became demanding in her demeanor towards the passengers. She kept rushing people into their seats, aggressively placing luggage into the overhead cabins and hurriedly read over the pre-flight procedures.  I understand that a flight schedule has to be honored, but it is not the fault of the passengers for tardiness or delays of United Airlines. United Airlines needs to train all staff and flight crew members in customer relations so they are adequately prepared to handle all circumstances, both good and bad. Passengers should not have to bear the emotional burden of dealing with any issues coming from United Airlines, especially from cranky flight crew members.",-1
2019-05-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Raleigh Durham,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1,!cancelled an afternoon flight,True,"  Newark to Raleigh Durham. This flight was fine until getting to Newark yesterday afternoon. From there things spiraled downwards trying to complete the rest of the trip to Raleigh. Weather delays cancelled an afternoon flight with rescheduling on an evening flight. That also got cancelled with rescheduling for the following day (today) at 1:30 PM. No option was given for standby on a earlier flight. No assistance was given with the hotel. The former was not helpful and the latter is somewhat standard for carriers. So far, okay. The problems were the following: i) lack of Customer Service personnel leading to waits of 30+ minutes each time flights were repeatedly cancelled to try and figure out what was going on (thought they somehow managed to have the premium services overstaffed based on casual observation), ii) while some customer service personnel were alright, most were quite surly, 'short' with customers, and overall quite unfriendly (this could be an airport characteristic - see below), iii) Newark Airport richly deserves it's ""worst airport in the US"" - That is United related as they use it as a hub, so odds are good they will inflict Newark Airport on you if you choose to travel with them. The problems with Newark 'Liberty'?: i) dirty and rundown, ii) very expensive for generally mediocre food options, iii) cramped, disorganized paths of movement for security gates, etc., iv) staff that are generally unhelpful, but 'try to make up for it' by being also unfriendly and rude, v) the area around the airport is pretty bleak, even for northern New Jersey (only matters if you have to see it, but United will help ensure you do unfortunately with flight cancellations, etc).",-1

We haven’t flown with United many times before so we weren’t exactly sure how the Basic Economy checked bag policy worked. You have to pay $30 for every bag because no carry-on bags are allowed. While we were asking for help with numerous things in the lobby, the person working behind the counter knew we were basic economy and that we had paid the bag fee but it was never mentioned that we needed to leave them anywhere. So upon getting to our gate, we asked the woman who gave us our tickets was rude, unhelpful, and had a bad attitude. We had to pay the extra $25 per bag fee because we brought our bags to the gate. We will not be flying with United again.",-1
2019-05-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Quebec City to Newark,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,customer service is not good,False,  United delayed the flight prior to having us board the plane. They then had us disembark after less than an hour. There were multiple additional delays before the flight was canceled. They left us stranded at the airport and had to change from a direct flight to a flight to Toronto with a five hour layover before traveling on to Newark Airport. I will not fly this airline any further. The customer service is not good and there was no consideration for the fact that I had to get another hotel room. Look elsewhere when flying.,-1
2019-05-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Jacksonville,1.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,2 hours delayed again,True,  Denver to Jacksonville . I was scheduled to leave for my daughter’s wedding on Thursday May 23 on a 6:23 AM flight. By 10 am it was determined the plane need a part. So United had it driven from Orlando to Jacksonville just so you understand that is a 4 hour drive. We finally took off at 6:30 PM. We were delayed over 12 hours losing a day of vacation. All we got for our inconvenience was 2 vouchers for food. That was a whole $20 for the 2 of us. Now sitting here in Denver returning home to Jax we are delayed again. First because the incoming flight was late and when it arrived guess what it has a mechanical problem. 2 hours delayed again and don’t have great hope it will only be that! I’m a frequent flight and can say without hesitation I will walk before I ever spend another dime on your airline.,-1

More amazingly, United Airline staff gave an explanation that the reason of delay is because of weather, while I know that other airline, such as Air canada still fly from Toronto to Anchorage as usual without delay. After that, staff only give us compensation of hotel and food accommodation with very very low value after 7 hours waiting in the airport.  Never going with UA again.

This crew is a notch above any I have experienced,  focused on service and team oriented. I was on the previous day cancelled Alaska 312 SFO To Newark. Feeling exhausted from that ordeal. (Alaska, too did a fine job of managing the crisis.) I couldn’t find my cell phone as I was leaving the plane to board the waiting bus. The ground crew was trying to force me to give up looking and get on the bus. This crew helped me stand my ground, she tore apart the seat and he found my phone in a place I had already looked They did not wait around for a thanks. The hustled to the bus and that was the last I saw of them. By now they have forgotten about the incident and me. I won’t forget about them.",1

Never ever choose United Airlines especially where they have Air India connection. Though they claim that they have star alliance with Air India the service is pathetic and they will ruin your trip. I booked my flight from Austin to Chennai for my family (me, my wife 11 months infant and 5 years daughter). United Air lines has not provided boarding pass for Air India connection (Mumbai-Chennai), they mentioned to collect it from Air India in Mumbai but I have my e-ticket provided by United.  Air India in Mumbai mentioned that they don’t find our tickets in their system but I have my e-ticket with United Air lines confirmation code.  I called United Airlines customer service ( pathetic service center with an approximate wait time of 30 minutes to connect to agent) and got Air India ticket numbers. I went to Air India again with that ticket numbers and they mentioned that flight is full and will send it next flight which is after 12 hours of original flight departure.  I am not sure how they provide e tickets without blocking the seat and I see couple of other passengers that booked through United who are on the same boat. imagine my situation who already had 9 hours layover had to wait another 12 hours with infant and kid.  Finally they asked me to wait till the last to see if there have any cancelled tickets.  after 3 hours of standing infront of their support desk they provided me the boarding passes just 20 minutes before start of the flight. Couple of other passengers that booked through United are not lucky enough and waiting for next flight and contacting United support over the phone about the issue.  as I have a little time to catch the flight they didn’t even allowed my carry on bags to checkin.  Stay away from United especially when you have kids or booking for parents. I never gone through such strain in any of my international travel and this would be my first and last trip with United.",-1
2019-05-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to San Diego,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,$30 fee for each carry-on bag,False,"  Seattle to San Diego. Hidden charges for checking a carry-on bag. If you take a carry-on bag to the gate, as you do with any other airlines, they will charge you $30 + a $25 fine for doing so. That's an extra $55 just for boarding a plane like normal with one carry-on. You are forced to pay the $30 fee for each carry-on bag while checking in online, or else you are blocked from checking in and must do so at the airport. None of this is advertised before you buy the ticket. That is just the most egregious of the problems United puts on its customers. Every other aspect of the airline's service makes it the absolute worst of the major airlines. They only exist because of government bailouts, they were about to fail (for good reason) before all that. Their food service is pathetic and obscenely overpriced, the airplanes are a mess, the flight attendants are rude and the gate agents belligerent.",-1

No TV screens to view during flight, internet was down, couldn't even stream on personal device. The snack was a pathetic tiny bag of wafers, asked for a diet coke, got a half of a tiny glass.

2019-05-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Omaha to Newwark,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,left in Baltimore airport overnight,False,"  I had a flight on United that went, not right, then down hill from there. It should have been a nice easy flight. Direct from Omaha to Newark. We ran into weather and had to land in Baltimore to refuel. Not a big deal, but they unloaded us while they refueled and waited for weather to clear. The loaded us back onto the plane, took us out on the tarmak and we had to sit for another half hour. Again, not a big deal, then the pilot announces that he has run out of flight time for the day. So, back to the Baltimore terminal where they had us get off the plane and told us to go down to baggage claim because everything upstairs was closed. We were told that they were getting us a bus to take us from Baltimore to Newark, but guess what, no bus driver. They couldn't get one. On top of that, no hotel rooms in the area. So, guess what, we, the entire set of passengers, were left in Baltimore airport overnight. No food, no water, no blankets, nothing, just a you can go back upstairs when the TSA comes in in the morning. I get it, sometimes things go wrong with air travel. Sometimes there are delays. But, as a passenger, being abandoned by the carrier at the airport baggage claim? This was supposed to be a quick 4 day trip to the city. But, no, the flight went wrong, hotel night missed, car rental canceled, entire day wasted because of this. But wait, it gets better from there. I tried reaching out to united customer service about doing something to ""make it right"". Guess what, they decided that for having done that to me, having destroyed multiple other arrangements that I had in place, for tripling the cost of my car rental, and abandoning me in an unscheduled city, they were going to offer me all of a $75 flight travel voucher so they could do it to me again. Let me be clear about this, this is not just my being grumpy about some bad weather here, they did this to the entire passenger list of people on that flight. And to be blunt, a $75 travel voucher just doesn't cut it.",-1

2019-05-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Cincinnati via Chicago,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,never be flying United again,True,"  Phoenix to Cincinnati via Chicago. This was by far the worst experience I've had dealing with an airline. I was scheduled to leave Phoenix and head back to Cincinnati, but my flight ended up being delayed over 24 hours. I know delays happen and sometimes there is little that can be done, but I had just had my wallet stolen the night before, had no money or ID, and really needed to get home. Because of the long delay, I was going to have to sleep in the airport that night, and then sleep in the Chicago airport the next night, with no money for food (wallet stolen). I felt the first agents at the desk were at least trying to be helpful after I explained my situation, but due to the long line they had to leave before I could find an earlier flight. Before leaving, they requested to have a supervisor come to the desk to see if there were any exceptions that could be made. The next agent I worked with was God awful and extremely insensitive. After again explaining my situation, I told her the previous agent was trying to help me find an earlier flight, either via united or another airline, to no avail. She said that agent should have never looked for another flight because they were not supposed to change anything, no exceptions. We spoke a little more, but she was of little help, and even had the audacity to joke around at my situation. It was infuriating. Eventually a supervisor showed up, but when I explained to him what was going on he asked the agent if they looked at any other airlines to see if there was anything that can be done, to which she replied she checked, but there was nothing available. This was right after she told me she wouldn't look because she couldn't change anything if she wanted to.... I eventually had to sleep in the airport until the flight later on in the day(which was delayed 1 more time). Luckily I found a flight that night from Chicago to Cincinnati via another airline so I didn't have to sleep in another airport overnight again, but I was severely underwhelmed with the help I received from United. I didn't understand why my flight was delayed for so long when I was able to find a flight so quickly with another airline. They offered no compensation, and the fact that the agent made several jokes about it made things so much worse. I along with many others that faced this long delay will never be flying United again.",-1

Not that much more expensive but worth the extra little bit of money I paid, comfortable very friendly crew that helped me throughout the whole trip, super fast check-in loved watching a movie the whole way there made my trip so comfortable, seats were fabulous had plenty of room.",1
2019-05-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jacksonville to Washington,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,1,delayed and then cancelled,True,  Jacksonville to Washington. I think I won't ever fly domestic economy flights by United again. On the way to Jacksonville from Newark the flight was delayed for 3hrs so my car rental was closed by the time we arrived. On the way back the flight was first delayed and then cancelled. Too much.,-1
2019-05-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Arkansas to New York,,,,,,1.0,1,no compassion or understanding,True,  Arkansas to New York. Booked a combo flight via Expedia with Delta and UA for this week. My sister had an unexpected health emergency last week in NC. AA was the only airlines that responded swiftly with emergency pricing - we booked and flew out last Saturday and returned to AR this weekend. Remember - this was an emergency and unexpected. We didn’t want to use additional vacation this week for this planned trip (cousin’s high school graduation in AL). Delta approved the exception and let us use it this August for our anniversary trip. UA said no exceptions - which I bet is a lie - if we were the right people it would have been approved for the exception. Don’t fly UA - no compassion or understanding.,-1
2019-05-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Omaha,3.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,disappointed with this airline,True,"  Denver to Omaha. I don’t normally write reviews, but today has been one for the books. Not only isn’t it clear why we had multiple delays, but no one (not even the pilots) know what’s going on. I got a plethora of messages saying I had a delay for unknown reasons (which I’m understanding of), but when it finally came time to board at the gate they had told us, they had us go to entirely different terminal, last minute. When I sprinted across the airport, I arrived at a gate with the description of Fort Lauderdale as the destination. The workers and guests included had no idea what was going on. Super disappointed that I had to pay for a carryon size bag and the constant contradiction that is their communication. Super disappointed with this airline.",-1
2019-05-20,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Los Angeles via Houston,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,most amazing customer service,True,  Dallas to Los Angeles via Houston. If there were 10 stars I would give it to United. They got my son on a plane so he was not stuck in the airport over night. He flew in from Managua on American Airlines and because they had cancelled so many flights he was stuck in DFW. He had a ticket the next morning on United Airlines. He went over to the United Club lounge to wait until they closed and then he was going to go sleep at the gate and wait for his 5:00 am flight. The agents were not comfortable with him doing this. So Denise and Michelle sprung into action calling the manager Vincent and he put Sebastian on the plane. They went so far as to give another passenger a voucher for the next flight so my son could get home safely. This was the most amazing customer service we have experienced ever. We are so gracious and will always fly United.  Unprecedented customer care and service by far!!!! We wish we could hug these 3 people. Thank you.,1
2019-05-20,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Montrose to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,$130 for a checked bag,True,  United is terrible. Their systems don't work with any booking agencies or other airlines. Had to pay $130 for a checked bag that they didn't put on my next two flights. I can't believe their lack of customer service. I'll drive before I take another United flight.,-1
2019-05-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Budapest,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly with United Airlines again,True,"  United Airline has completely failed us during each leg of our trip from the US to Europe. Not only did they cancel our connecting flight from Brussel to Budapest due to an inexplicable 'scheduled change' but they did not book us on another flight. If we had no caught this ahead of time, we would have been stranded in Brussels. After calling United Airlines and speaking to their customer service department, they informed me that this 'scheduled change' was not their fault and therefore they were not entitled to find a solution for us. After spending 2 hours on the phone with them, they finally agreed to book us new flights so that we could reach our final destinations at the beginning and the ending of our trip. For 2 hours United Airlines attempted to book us on flights with different returning dates or routes with extreme layovers (over 10 hours) and I had to fight with them to finally get a travel itinerary that was almost similar to the original travel itinerary that we paid for. The customer service team was extremely rude and reminded me throughout the call that this was a courtesy they were performing that they would not do it for me again. On top of all the pre-flight chaos, the flight itself was extremely uncomfortable and the crew was rude. When we finally began to board our return flights back to the US there was no information about our flight anywhere within the Munich Airport and we had to ask 5 people working at the airport before we were told where the United Airline gates are located. Because it seems that United Airlines has a pattern of causing stress and chaos for their customers it was no surprise that our boarding passes did not include our Gate information. The Munich airport also treats United Airlines extremely poorly and the terminal in which all of the gates are located is extremely bare bones (only a restroom). Once you enter the terminal, after crossing 4 checkpoints, you are not permitted to exit back into the rest of the airport where the shops and restaurants are located. This is extremely uncomfortable when United Airlines has booked you a flight with a 5-hour layover in the early morning hours. Finally, while we waited during our layover in Munich, we attempted to check-in for our next United Airlines flight (IAD to CHS) but the mobile app was unresponsive. When we were finally able to check-in via my laptop, we were told that we have to pay for our checked bags AND our carry on bags. This was not mentioned to us at any time during my 2 hours call with customer service or listed in any confirmation emails. To say that this is one of the worst, if not the worst, airline in the skies in a complete understatement. I will never fly with United Airlines again regardless of the conditions for which I am traveling. I wouldn't even fly United again if the ticket was free. Shame on you United Airlines.",-1
2019-05-20,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Las Vegas,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,had horrible treatment,True," Chicago to Las Vegas. Is it normal to buy flight, hotel and rent a car through Orbitz? I thought it's normal. United think differently. I get not simple economy, but basic economy. There was not much explanation in Orbitz. Luggage charges supposed to be normal. That is why I choose United [paid more] instead of Frontier and JetBlue. Those companies are charging for everything. To my surprise, in ORD I paid $70 for a carry-on bag, which was half size of what supposed be a regular carry-on bag. Because of the basic economy ticket, United treated me like a 3rd class person. I was denied full information about basic economy. I could not make check-in online. I was only shown my flight is on time. I cannot see my seating, I could not upgrade my seating and of cause cannot read any restrictions for basic economy. I had horrible treatment from United a few times already. I will never fly United again even if their tickets will be half price of JetBlue.",-1

I am disappointed how United doesn't respect people's time. This is my second time flying with them the last time my flight was delayed 4 different time departing and arriving. This time I almost missed my connecting flight. We are still delayed to leave which makes me arrives after mid night the excuse is printer not working. Please avoid flying United.,-1

Never buy a ticket through United! They caused my family to lose our boarding passes on their apps because they thought we were going to miss our flight from Denver to Sioux Falls. Also, I should add the reason we were late to the flight is that a United plane was stuck in our gate for docking. No matter what we did we could not get them back and we missed our flight. We are currently stuck in Denver airport until we get a new flight rescheduled. Thanks, United.",-1

2019-05-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington DC to Kiev, Ukraine via Munich",1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,trip turned into a disaster,True," I’m beyond disappointed with my long trip to the Ukraine. Flight United 4911 has already left the gate and was in the middle of the runway when all of a sudden the plane stopped and we were announced that there is going to be a 20 minute delay. The airplane was shut down and no air was coming in. After an hour and a half standing in the middle of the runway with no air our plane was towed back to the gate. On top of that I was sitting at the very back where it got so hot that I could barely breath. That lead to me missing all my connecting flights to the Ukraine. I was rebooked for a different flight, leaving out of a different airport. However, I was told that it was my responsibility to pay for the cab to get to IAD from DCA. On top of everything my baggage with important medications got lost as it was sent to NY and I went to Munich. My trip turned into a disaster with long layovers.",-1
2019-05-17,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Los Angeles,2.0,,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,bag taken from me as too big,True,"  Washington to Los Angeles. Last 3 flights, United gate agents berate passengers to check bags. I am a frequent flyer, with status, and one of the first to board. My bag was taken from me as too big. I’ve flown over 25K miles with United already this year- it has always fit fine in the overhead. I asked to show the gate agent that it fit fine in the bin they have to measure the size of carry-ons, she told me I could not even try. She marked it for checked-baggage. I took it, and showed her that it fit perfectly in the size requirements, even photographing it. She said it didn’t matter, she would be taking my bag. Lovely. Why have rules if they won’t follow them?",-1
2019-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Toronto,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,2.0,3,not be travelling United in future,True,"  Chicago to Toronto. We had a total of 6 flights with United over a 2 week period, 2 of which had delays on the way to our destination and our way home which caused us to miss our connecting flights. On our way to our destination, our flight from Chicago to San Fran was delayed by about 2 hrs causing us to miss our flight in SAN Francisco to Honolulu due to mechanical issues. The lineup at the customer service centre was awful having to wait over one hour just to plan our next flight. We were travelling with some friends that we were supposed to be on the same flight of our final leg to Honolulu which caused some issues with our itinerary as we were unable to land together. On our way home, our flight from San Fran to Chicago was delayed by 1.5 hrs due to the weather which made us miss our connecting flight once again in Chicago. Our next flight was not scheduled for another 4hrs that morning. We understand that weather causes delays but to have our next leg be delayed by an extra 4 hours after already having travelled for almost 24 hrs seems to be excessive.There was also an earlier flight we could have been placed on, however the customer service representative did nothing to try and see if there was any way we could make that flight. We understand things happen that cause delays but it seems obvious that United does not take in consideration their customers total travel time when rescheduling connecting flights and does not even offer any type of compensation, even something as a food voucher would have been appreciated. It’s safe to say we will not be travelling with United in the future.",-1

They offered food for purchase, but ran out half way through the plane. Once we landed, the airport didnt have an available gate! We waited on the tarmack for almost an hour. The pilot and attendants were rude and told us to keep our seat belts on. No air conditioning. Since it was a long flight, and they ran out of food all the kids were hot, hungry, and tired. Never will I fly this airline again. No room, bad service.",-1
2019-05-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Punta Cana,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,they seem to not care,False,"  We are currently in Punta Cana from a flight from Richmond. The check in and flight was smooth, but then United Airlines lost our bag. We are on day two of our vacation, and they are saying our bag is still in Washington. They have ruined our vacation, and there are different answers every time we speak with someone. One person says the bag will be coming, and then someone else says there is no record of the bag. This has all of our essentials and clothes and they seem to not care. They said they could reimburse us, but with United it’s not worth the chance. I can honestly say I will never fly with United again.",-1

I'm a United Premier 1K traveler. Still all that good customer background did not prevent United from demoting me from Premium to Economy. Discriminated in favor of a more deserving passenger? Told to shut up and sit down when I complained for the undeserving demotion. Threatened when I asked the FA's name. I raised this issue all the way to United's CEO. I thought he means that customer care is important, no, he doesn't. He just cares to get my money. Customers are just a necessary inconvenience.",-1

2019-05-11,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Lansing to Green Bay via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst customer service,True,"  Lansing to Green Bay via Chicago. United Airlines has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced in my life. Lose my bag that they required me to check, left on hold. Transferred between departments, each saying I need to talk to the other, nobody genuinely does anything to help, and what they do offer is less than the minimum anybody would expect for this level of inconvenience. Forced me to check my bag again today, even after an hour plus phone call prior to arriving at the airport, where I tried everything I could to get them to allow me to not have to check my carry on. Apparently it’s cheaper to pay a service charge, in addition to paying for a checked bag, than to upgrade my ticket for another $100. I get to the airport and they make me pay for the checked bag and I still can’t carry it on. Have to check it and hope to god they don’t lose it again. Get to the gate and the flight is delayed, going to miss my connection from Chicago to home. Nobody here for the airline at the gate so I have to call the 800 number again, keep getting cut off, left on hold again to die, only to be told to try and make my connecting flight, though we know it’s on time and boarding closes two minutes after this one arrives. I’m again at the mercy of random ticketing agent in Chicago when I get there, and hope to god there’s a spot for me on a later flight... don’t know if and when I get home, and if I’ll even have my bag when I get there. My phone is currently dying so I will have no way of letting anyone at home know when and what flight I’ll be in on, because the charge cords (the one I brought from home AND the one I had to purchase when I got here because my phone was dying and United lost my bag) are in my carry on which they again required me to check. United don’t deserve anybody’s business with service like this.",-1

Vancouver to Los Angeles via San Francisco. Worst airline ever. I’ll not fly UA again, it wasn’t worth the money. We were on a family trip to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. Our first flight were delayed by almost 2 hours. Because of that reason we lost our connection flight from SFO to LAX. Staff were rude, they booked us in separated seats (even my 5 yo daughter). Our second flight was also delayed by more than 1 hour. They ruined our mood and our trip. We we’re exhausted after spending an entire day at the airport with a 5 yo who couldn’t wait to get to Disneyland. We asked the staff at Vancouver to move us to a direct flight and they refused to do it. No customer service. It was a nightmare.",-1
2019-05-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,crew scowling at passengers,True," This was one of the worst flying experiences I have ever had. First the check in staff were rude and told us as we were boarding that the overhead bins were already full (why?) and we had to check in our cabin baggage. They told us that it would be checked through to Auckland. When I said no, they insisted or we couldn't fly. We still had a 12.5 hour flight from LA to NZ after this one with no carry on and whatever we could keep on us personally. Get on the plane no greeting, ignored. Inflight, crew scowling at passengers. One crew member, while collecting rubbish, looked each passenger in the face and just said ""trash"" at them. Land in LA, no idea where we had to go for our connecting flight, no info anywhere. Went to the United customer service and asked them, they were annoyed we were asking and pointed to where we had to go. I double checked that our luggage was checked all the way through and we were asked for our bag tags. The United check in person back in Washington hadn't given us any on our boarding passes! Finally get to Auckland, no luggage, even the carry on. United hadn't loaded any of it onto ANZ. Been home for 24 hours now, no luggage still. This also happened to two other people on our flight to NZ, they flew United from Florida to LA and none of their luggage arrived in NZ either. When I reached out to United, they blamed Air NZ. I will never fly this airline again under any circumstances.",-1

I booked round tickets for me and my family with united Airlines. I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 24 march with my family (wife, one child and one infant) and my return ticket was for 24th April (Delhi to Newark. But when we went to Delhi airport for flight check-in on 24th April, airport officers/check-In counter told us that my infant baby ticket is suspended by United Airlines (they gave us proof also), and they can’t issue boarding pass for Infant. When we contacted United Airlines customer care at same time then they told us that my infant ticket is suspended because as per united airline records my infant baby did not travel to Delhi from Newark (EWR) on 24th March 2019 and that’s why United Airline suspended my infant ticket because of no show and we missed our flight due to suspended status of infant ticket. We have Infant boarding pass(EWR to DEL), I am not sure how come a International Airline can miss something like this. Initially they told us that they don’t have any seat available till 5th May and we can reissue 3 tickets for 5th May 2019 but asked to buy Infant ticket as he is turning 2 years on 1 May 2019. After many effort we were able to get reissue of tickets for 28th April but with different route, DEL to HKG and HKG to EWR",-1

Unfortunately the screen malfunctioned on the plane. Now, I know, TVs on a plane in general is a luxury. However, this was a 5 hour flight which resulted in a lengthy delay at 11 at night and for those who struggle to sleep in an aisle seat and very long and entertain-less flight.

2019-05-07,0.9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tampa to Beijing via Washington,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,2x2x2 seating on the 787,True,"  
Tampa to Beijing via Washington. This was an award business class flight ticketed four months ago -scheduled for SAS from Washington Dulles to Copenhagen and Air China continuing on to Beijing. When the SAS pilots went out on strike a week before my departure, everything was left up in the air, so to speak. I waited until the day before my flight in the hope that the Scandanavian labor dispute would be resolved, but my luck and time ran out. United Airlines had the first segment from TPA to IAD, and the award was booked through Mileage Plus, so I called their gold elite help line to attempt some sort of rescheduling. The customer service representative was patient in guiding me through several alternative options to Beijing. Connecting through Copenhagen was not possible, but she did manage to force open a business class seat on United's non-stop IAD-PEK. In fact, both flights were eminently pleasant, although 13 hours on any flight seems interminable. Both flights departed and arrived significantly early, and service onboard met my expectations for a long haul business class flight. Although our cabin was 100% full, the attendants hustled and provided attentive service. The elaborate meal on the flight to China was delicious and filling, although the beef main-course could have been somewhat hotter. In addition, United's 2x2x2 seating on the 787 is not the equal of the 1x2x1 arrangement I was anticipating on SAS. Nevertheless, the seat was quite comfortable. Special mention should be made of the bedding United offers in Polaris. In the end, although I was disappointed to miss out on flying with SAS and Air China, this was my first experience with the new Polaris business class, and I was impressed by crew, plane, and customer service.",1

I sincerely try to avoid taking United at all costs. Unfortunately. My last 3 flights were with United. Travel with your organization is truly frustrating. Your flights are never on time, you charge ridiculous prices for services that are either free or half the cost with your competitors. Even your own employees seem frustrated working for your organization. I am writing this review to let less experienced travelers know. If you have other flight options, please use them. United will be routinely late, you will miss connections and they will nickel and dime you for everything. Their staff can be extremely unhelpful and essentially take the attitude that you are stuck with their inferior service and high fees.",-1

I flew from London to Chicago with a transit in Brussels. First of all, my connecting flight was overbooked so they made me wait for a very long time before finally letting me and many others waiting know that we will have a seat on the plane. They also forced me to check in my hand luggage which contained critical documents that I needed because the flight was overbooked. The worst is yet to come. I waited for an hour in Chicago for my luggage but it never came. I went to the United counter and they told me it never left London and they told me that they will put my luggage on the next flight but guess what, it's been 24 hours and I've been on the phone with them twice and nobody can locate my luggage. Not a single person. I flew to Chicago to attend my sister's graduation so now I'm stranded with no toiletries, no clothes and all they can say is for me to keep my receipts. I am also sure that I'll be getting reimbursed 2 months later. United is the worst airline with no manners at all. Do not start their Mileage Program because they don't even have great benefits. I will go back to American Airlines who were very helpful when a similar situation happened in the past and they were able to ship my luggage the next day.",-1

Generally good experience with new United Premium Plus Economy on intercontinental flight. The staff (both FA and ground) was basically polite and very active. Food was good and sophisticated. I appreciate that ice creams are still served as opposed to European carriers. The local products choice (beer, booze, desserts) is a nice accent and should be appreciated. I appreciate also handed menus, although the after take off service didn't happen on flight back to FRA. In addition there was no choice of pre landing snack although listed in menu. Unfortunately completely no pre-take off service (double focus on business class instead). Also the lavatories shared with overcrowded economy class. IFE could also be better.

First of all, they, the United airlines have bad management in technical glitches, they simply don't know how to manage the passages or travellers. I flew from Denver after a business meeting to Houston and supposed to connect to Monroe, I landed on 2nd May 2019 at 11:00 pm and I was supposed to be landed at 8:30 pm, coz of 'so called' bad weather. They had cancelled the flight to Monroe which was expected to take off at 9:30 pm. When I checked with support staff, they asked me to stay at hotel for overnight which I need to pay from my pocket. The next day I waited all day in the airport and they gave a flight at 9:45 pm, which was again 30 mins late. Guys just avoid United for any given case, or avoid coming to Houston as connecting flight.",-1

I don’t remember the last time I had a flight on time with this airline. Then again today I am trying to head home to see family and get home from working all week and my plane was delayed for two hours, we got boarded then they decide to tell us they are delaying it again for three more hours! We all had to unboard and wait around to see what they are doing. The workers at the desk are rude in any state I’m in. I’m so tired of United. I do not plan on using them again. I understand some delays. You can’t help the weather but this is getting ridiculous.",-1

So, my daughter and I went to Iowa from Connecticut to visit my son. When we went to retrieve our luggage, my daughters never showed up. We spoke with someone at baggage claim and they filed a claim and said it must’ve gone somewhere else. We had purchased items just for this trip, now we have to not only replace the items we bought but now we have to purchase her all new clothes. We spent money we hadn’t budgeted for and when we returned home we were told that her luggage was found and it went to Albuquerque, NM. She sent in her receipts and received her luggage, finally, only to find that they had damaged the suitcase. They called and she was work so she asked me to call them back. The automated system does not make it easy to get a human being and then I finally get a human from another country who can barely speak English. He let me know that it will be 6-8 weeks for them to review the case. So United sent her luggage to another state, we had to spend money we hadn’t budgeted for and they broke her luggage and now we have to wait to get our money back. I will never use United again..",-1

I received no communication from United, none at all indicating there was any change in the schedule. I printed out our boarding passes in advance, got to the airport 2 hours before flight time, went through security and to the gate with noone at any time saying the flight was cancelled. When we got to the gate, the board said the flight was cancelled. Noone from United was even there to assist us, to help us reschedule. We were left on our own. Thank God Delta personnel were in the terminal at another gate and were so helpful to us. If we left it to United, we would still be there. They didn't are at all about their customers. Because of United's horrendous customer service, we had to wait 8 hours and then fly back with Delta and fly into LaGuardia thereby incurring another $100 expense to get to Newark at 1:00A.M. in the morning of the next day. I contacted Customer Service and I requested $470.00 which is exactly one half of the total price paid for the roundtrip. All they have offered is a $75.00 travel voucher. In the future, I would rather pay more with Delta than fly with the unfriendly skies of United!",-1

My flight was Montreal - Newark - Myrtle Beach, I forgot mine in the magazine compartment in front of me on the flight to Myrtle Beach. I realize that 20 feet past the gate so I try to go back to the plane, I cannot it’s the law, ok I get it! The girl at the counter communicated with another one in the plane, after 3 messages I hear passport negative for seat 10f. I can’t believe it, it was just in front of the seat in the magazine compartment, the girl at the counter is 0 help and that’s it, it’s not there. It’s a passport not earphone, kind of important when you travel internationally! A couple of days later my passport is found at Chicago airport, so it was in the plane and the girl just did not check properly, I had to rebook domestic to Burlington for 300$ and have someone pick me up there and pass Canadian custom by car to enter Canada without a passport, worst customer service I can imagine, they just didn’t care! I don’t think I will ever fly United ever again. I cannot understand how someone can be so unhelpful with something as important as a passport especially since I knew exactly where it was United never again.",-1

Negatives: Not comfortable seating, ticket prices are more expensive than most airlines, can only bring 1 carry on and 1 personal bag for free, must pay to check a bag, no leg room on plane, flight attendants were not friendly Positives: ...I honestly can’t think of any... Story: “The flight attendants are not here to provide you beverages and snacks, they are here for your safety” -Captain. That was how the captain, greeted everyone after everyone had been seated. If you’re looking for seats with barely any cushion to them and the most unorganized crew members, fly United. While it was only a 2 hour plane ride to and from I will definitely never be flying United ever again. The bus ride from the airport to the rental car place had WAY more comfortable seating than the plane and it’s not like you can reserve what kind of plane you want. So for my 6” 4 boyfriend he couldn’t even sit up fully or his head would hit the ceiling. Then when we landed there was no one there to open the gate for us. So we had to wait that much longer for the whoever to figure it out. Point blank don’t fly United.",-1

Said I had to wait at least an hour before boarding to move seats. When I asked about our seats boarding was set to being in just 20 min, I mentioned that and the lady at gate 77C just walked away.

Original flight delayed over an hour. Show up an hour before the delayed time and told the plane already left. Was blamed for not showing up at the original time. Why would a system that sends an email and text saying the flight is delayed not send an alert saying the delay no longer applies?

When asked prior to boarding for help switching they were no help at all and that I would have to figure it out on board. Once I board I asked the stewardess to help me see if someone would switch and she said she does not do this. I expressed that I was terribly afraid to fly and did not want to sit near strangers.

I asked United if they could be extended and they said unfortunately not but gave me two more passes. I’m traveling today by American Airlines first class international.

I was in the window seat and unable to get out, so I threw the towel in the aisle where it remained for another hour. I reported this to United’s website and have had very little contact.",-1

For the first time in 15 years and hundreds of thousands of miles of airline travel, I was forced to gate-check my carry-on luggage because the overhead space was full. This normally would not have been an issue, except that upon arriving at San Francisco, I received a message requiring me to re-route back to Tampa. United didn't have a flight that worked and so I flew back on a different airline. It didn't occur to me that United wouldn't just send my bag back to my originating airport. Instead they want to charge me to have my bag FedExed to me - a very hostile staff in their baggage department clearly needs a vacation and a reminder that she works in a free country. I have tried to explain my circumstances as being unusual but apparently people book flights now and get off after only one leg because it is cheaper. I'm not sure if I understand this particular phenomenon, but I do understand when a company has blown past their sell-by date and needs to be cut down to size. If customers are using their system in a way that they don't care for - fix your pricing. It is unacceptable to take someone's bag, tell them that you aren't holding it hostage when you are doing exactly that. The airline has no right to insist that I prove anything nor does the airline have any right to penalize customers for not completing their itinerary. United lost a customer over this - I will not fly them again. We live in an age when personal liberties are used as toilet paper by companies that simply amend their terms of service to allow themselves to do whatever they like. United has clearly lost its grip. Fix your pricing, fix your system, grow a few brain cells and stop acting like a has-been monopolist that can't think themselves out of a paper bag - but keep your hands off of me.",-1

Our return flight was diverted to Detroit from Chicago due to weather. We were made to stand at their ticket counter for 1.5 hours waiting for instructions about a bus to take us to Chicago; the bus was 1.5 hours late and there was mass confusion as 150 passengers tried to get on 3 buses. It was apparent that United had no master plan in place designed to handle this situation even though I’m sure this was not the first time it had happened. Shame on them.,-1

Then tried to board her plane was pulled aside for a seat assignment, and then denied her ticket said it was an illegal ticket and gave her seat away. Held her at the gate till she missed her flight and then said they would give her a refund. But when she called to get a refund they said absolutely not.

I bought a ticket flight with United a long time ago and I choose United because of the short duration of the flight and short layover between the flights. Less than 1 month to the trip I received an email with a flight change using Copa Airlines flights. It was added another connection increasing my overall flight trip for more than 6 hours. The trip hours doesn’t make sense: I would arrive in Chicago at 11 am but my next flight time would be at 9 am from Chicago to Panama, which means I would arrive in Chicago 2 hours late for the next flight. (they sent it to me - company huge mistake with time sense) I called to customer service to try to fix it and they offered another ticket with 16hours of a layover or the reimbursement of the ticket! How I would find another international ticket in so short notice with a good price and good conditions of time flight? I asked to talk with the manager that was not flexible at all and said that I must accept the conditions of the changes otherwise the only thing they can do it is reimbursement. However, that was not a simple change condition... that was a huge mistake with time flight. I couldn’t get a plane that had already left because I flight that they added. I would miss the connection because of a United airline mistake. The manager was not doing anything to try to fix my problem and she said that: “ in my end, there is no more I can do”. I had to accept their change offer conditions resulting in a more 7 hours of increase in my overall flight trip. By the end of the call, the manager was impolite on her manners with an angry tone of voice. I travel a lot as well as my family and this has never happened to me before with the other airline's companies. This will be the last time I travel United. I don’t want this kind of problems for me in the future.",-1

I landed in Houston and before I even got off the plane my connecting flight to OKC was cancelled. Everyone I talked to that worked for United was rude. I was told I was automatically booked for the next day late afternoon which was unacceptable. No one would help except one agent who got me on standby, but I was #20 on a full flight. Clearly I didn’t make it. Then I found out 2 people were ahead of me on standby and they already had a confirmed ticket on a later flight. Now tell me how they should take priority over someone whose flight was cancelled. I ended up buying a one way ticket on American. I will never fly United or recommend them again. Houston is supposed to be their hub so tell me why they can’t enlist another plane to make up for all the cancelled flights. Even flying today everyone I came in contact with was rude. I’m talking about the people behind the counters at the Houston United gates. The only thing they did right was release my luggage to my daughter at OKC while she was waiting for my American flight to land. My cancelled flight was #6295",-1

My last 3 flights were over 1 hour late they have discontinued premier access so my wait time through security has been over 45 minutes and still every flight is full. I have finally signed up for Delta status match as this flight has really pushed me over the edge. Flight 2 hour delay, sat in front of door waiting to get on for 15 minutes because cleaning crew missed items. Food is disgusting and cabin staff attitude is worse than passengers that have suffered another disappointment.

We ended up on this flight as our original flight which was to Montreal via air Canada was cancelled at the very last minute without warning and we had to rebook. We arrived early boarded on time. It wasn’t until we got on the tarmac and the plane was still sitting. Apparently the captain had to some systems checks and something didn’t pass. Once passed about an hr had lapsed fuel has been burned so we had to return to the gate to refuel. It took a total of 2 hrs for the process and we had a connecting flight to Italy and only had a two hour layover. All the while the flight attendants could not reassure that our connecting flight would be held for us to catch. There were issues with this situation from the get go. The thought of a cancelled flight was something I understand is normal but at the 11th hr was not appropriate notification to customers. For customer safety, one would think that the pilot both the ones on the previous flight and current flight should have some system of checks for the plane well before we get on the plane for the aforementioned safety and efficiency. All this added stress to customers could have been avoided if there was a better system of checks and communications going out to customers. After all this, this was the 2nd significant incident I had with this airline and doubt I will ever travel with them again in my lifetime if I had a choice.",-1
2019-04-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,El Paso to Houston,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,Truly a poor airline service,True,"  El Paso to Houston. Truly a poor airline service all around. The plane from the small airport to Houston smelled filthy and had tiny seats, even for a petite female. I opted for the cheapest option for my flight - basic economy, which was a huge mistake. They did not authorize changes, cancellations, or adjustments at any time immediately after purchase. After waiting on the phone for 20 minutes, I was greeted by a customer service representative who basically just told me there’s nothing they could do and maybe try contacting my ticket issuer, Capitol One. I had applied some reward points to deduct about $93 from my over $400 round trip ticket from Killeen TX to El Paso TX. I contacted them only to be told that United is the only company authorized to make changes to my flight itinerary, which I can only imagine the original United rep has already known (or should have at least). Essentially she had just pointed fingers elsewhere to avoid problem solving. We are also not even allowed a carry on item at this rate, which seems completely unreasonable. The price of their economy tickets are not comparable to other airlines such as Frontier or Southwest, which makes it more confusing as to why they are so strict (the fact that I regularly use cheap airlines should indicate that my standards are not high to begin with, I just like affordable travel). On the same token, even if I had paid a higher fare to be able to carry on items and adjust my flight, I still would be sitting in the same dingy aircraft crammed next to the person in the seat next to me. I would almost be insulted that I bothered to pay the $50-100 more for the same poorly maintained vehicle. The aisles in my first flight were so narrow that I was shoulder checked every time someone walked by, while still shoulder to shoulder with the gentleman next to me. The seat did not recline either, so I sat there, sitting up at 90 degrees, being bumped for an hour from both sides. Furthermore, their WiFi is both overpriced and limiting. To be fair, I should have read more carefully where it states “steaming not supported”. I could not watch Hulu or Netflix with the $9.99 for 1 hour of WiFi that I paid for. Instead I’m using it to write this review, while on my return flight that was delayed for 2 hours this morning. Instead of watching the new Game of Thrones episode on the WiFi that could have paid for a meal, I will be sitting here with my elbows and knees completely tucked in uncomfortably, again, as to not be sitting on top of the man next to me. Overall, this airline is grossly overpriced for the lack of services it affords it’s customers. Will not ever be flying United again unless the military books it for me.",-1

I travel quite a bit and this was the single worst experience I've ever had. I was with a group of people going to New York City, and we planned to arrive there in the morning, leaving plenty of time to rest, get lunch and dinner, and then see Mean Girls on Broadway. We got to the airport at about 9pm, made it to the gate to see that our flight had been delayed until 8am the next day. It was because one person called in sick. The airline did not get us a hotel for the night, so we slept at the airport on the incredibly uncomfortable couches because the tile floor, which would have been more comfortable, was too cold and we weren't even allowed through security to the gate so we were in front of the doors that were opening and closing, with loud announcements coming in every minute or so. United airlines gave each of us three $10 meal vouchers in compensation that were ultimately useless as we did not have a long enough layover in Chicago to buy anything. We missed Mean Girls, and received no refund. Thanks, United!",-1

This is just the 3rd instance in a row. United doesn’t care about customer service or satisfaction.

Besides this problem, crew members have been rude to people that were just trying to get information.

I was supposed to arrive at my destination 18 hours before my life changing interview giving me plenty of time to be prepared. But of course, with United, I ended up landing in Boston at 12am (not Burlington, Vermont), and had to rent a car ($312.07 receipt attached, wasn’t planning on renting) to drive to 3.5 hours to Stowe, Vermont to make sure I got to my interview by 9am. I slept for 2 hours before my lifetime interview because United lost my bag and I didn’t have my suit. So, I had to buy a full suit for my interview ($150) an hour before my interview. This truly couldn’t be any worse of a situation and impacted my personal life dramatically. I made it to the interview, but 2 hours of sleep and cheap temporary dress clothes was devastating. No bag, cancelled flight due to maintenance, no flight to my destination, renting a car, driving hours after midnight, all could have been avoided by United. I would also like to add I still don’t have my bag and I’m flying back home. I’ve gone this whole trip with no clothes, no toiletries, nothing. United needs to fix this.",-1
2019-04-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Delhi,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,really worst experience,False,"  Newark to Delhi. This was first time i booked international flight for my family through United Airlines it was really worst experience i ever had with any airlines.The flight UA82 was scheduled from Newark to Delhi at 9:50 PM on 16th April 2019. We went to airport with 2 small kid (1 infant) and really struggled for checkin, United airlines agent were really arrogant and not responding properly on query, anyway i spent 1 hour and 30 minute finding what to do and agents sending me here and there. At last we have been asked to be on a long queue to get help, finally after another 40 minute on queue we have been told that flight is cancelled and that is the reason we had difficulty in checkin through kiosk. Wow this was terrible, i had to drive 60 miles to reach airport and now i hear flight is cancelled, there was no prior intimation on cancellation of the flight. Thankfully i kept few days of gap for my next flight from Delhi to Raipur. I was given only one option of connecting flight next day which i had no choice of denying so accepted. I really never thought United Airlines is going to be such a terrible experience. Now onwards UA would be a last option to fly with.",-1

Tried to check in online (and via phone, and with a live human) and was told that one cannot check in without a checked bag. In other words, there is a $30 fee for checking in online. Goodbye, United. It's been fun!",-1
2019-04-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Oklahoma City,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,2,little arm or leg room,True,"  Chicago to Oklahoma City. We were told that we had to check our carry-on luggage because it wouldn’t fit in the overhead cabin. Once boarded, we saw the limited space and were shocked. The aircraft was very warm, small and uncomfortable. There were no plugs for devices nor were there any screens to view tv/movies. I was blown away with how little space there was, the lack of amenities and how cramped the flight was for the money we paid just to be on the aircraft. How is it we are now spending more and more money these days, yet going through hoops just to fly and getting less? There was little arm or leg room, no WiFi, there was water but no soap in the one restroom available, my armrest would not go up and the compartment holding the magazines was broken. I will think twice before boarding another United aircraft again.",-1
2019-04-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Chicago via Kansas City,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,will never book with them again,True," Dublin to Chicago via Kansas City. I have been a longtime miles plus and explorer member. I booked flights on United for my wife and son from Dublin to Kansas City through the United website using my account. This is one of those code share flights where Aer Lingus carries out the first leg and United, the second. The Aer Lingus flight was delayed and my wife and son missed their connecting flight. When at the United customer desk, they were told that it wasn't their problem. There were no more flights to Kansas City that night and they would not arrange accomodation. Instead, United made a ten year old and his mother sleep in the airport, and I still had to drive three hours to collect them at another airport, unless they wanted to remain in the Chicago airport for another day. I am astounded by the service provided by United. I will never book with them again and will take steps to cancel my explorer credit card with them.",-1

They cancelled our flight and we were forced to stay in Chicago for 2 extra days without any vouchers for food or a hotel. There is not enough staff to address the customers who have paid lots of money for their poor service. Do not fly United Airlines. Ever. Unless you enjoy total chaos, poor service, and anxiety. I will never fly with them again.",-1

2019-04-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to San Antonio,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,dissatisfied and disappointed,True,  We were shocked at the lack of customer service given to us by the airline attendants going from San Antonio to Denver for a connecting flight to Hawaii and LA to San Antonio coming back. An attendant coming home literally told my husband on our honeymoon we shouldn't of purchased these tickets if we wanted to sit together (making the assumption we are broke because we paid for economy tickets). I also observed the flight attendant turn down a mother and child to sit together. On the flight from San Antonio to Denver we asked to sit together for our honeymoon trip and all staff including the captain stated we could ask around but they would not help us. We ended up sitting separately on both connecting flights. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed in United Airlines punishing economy class fliers by splitting them up. We will not book with them again and will spread the word about their poor unprofessional practices .,-1

Paid to have an assigned seat to be next to a companion in a flight and without notification of the airline changed the seat 3 times. When I called to try to rectify the situation the lady on the he phone kept repeating that she was not able to help and that the seats were transferred to the airport.

The flight was delayed twice, due to weather, which is understandable. However, the app did not accurately update flight changes. The gate agents refused to address customer concerns in a timely and accurate manner. Finally, the jet walk was broken when we arrived 2 hours late to LaGuardia. Once again, the staff seemed unconcerned with the fact the a jet if tired, late customers was inconvenienced again by their incompetence. I will never fly United again.",-1

2019-04-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Antonio to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never use United Airlines again,True,"  I had a flight from San Antonio to Zurich via Washington. We got on the plane but they were driving us around the airport for 2 hours because of the storms in other parts of Texas. Finally we had to leave the plane and go back to the terminal, because the crew could not work more regarding to the regulations. We missed our connections on Washington, so we had to wait in the line til they rebooked the tickets for everyone. This woman rescheduled my flights so that I had to change one more time in London with only a half an hour time time span. Also the first flight from SA to Houston became critical because of the delay again. So I made them to rebook my flight again. So I had to stay one more night in SA, and leave 6 am at morning to New York. There I will have to wait more than 6 hours and finally get to Zurich a day later than i planned. Horrible experience. I'll never use United Airlines again! They do not cover any of my additional costs, but saying with big smile, that it was not their fault, but I can blame the bad weather.",-1
2019-04-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Denver,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,changed our flight schedules,False,"  A word of caution to those that fly United Airlines and their unreliability. Recently, my sister and I were on vacation in Las Vegas, Nevada and scheduled to be back in North Dakota on April 9, 2019 by about 4:30 pm, as we had plans later that day. Our flight was to depart Vegas at 9:58 am on Tuesday the 9th of April. We got up early at our Hotel and went to do check out at our Hotel, and also asked they print out our airline tickets (Las Vegas to Denver, and Denver to Bismarck). After they were printed I became upset with the lady at the counter and told her that those were not our tickets and she replied that is all she could do for us; we left the counter unapologetic. We headed for the airport and gave our luggage to the United guys at about 8:30 am or a little before and also asked them to check into our flights. They said the flight tickets we were given were our tickets, and there was nothing else they could do. Then we proceeded to our gate area as to our flight that was on our tickets. We asked the United guy there about our ticket matter. He said our flights were changed in January and that we would of been notified of our change. I told him that we booked our vacation in January and showed him our e-mail flight confirmation dated March 22, 2019 from our travel agent. The flight confirmation clearly stated that our flights were still departing at 9:58 that morning. I asked the United guy if the earlier flight that we were supposed to be on still existed and he said it did; he gave no further explanation for our changes made and seemed reluctant to talk on the matter. We were never notified of our flight changes, and neither was our travel agent notified of any changes. United Airlines are the ones that changed our flight schedules, as we were not asked nor did we volunteer. Often times those that choose to be bumped and make that choice get compensated and in our case they have totally avoided the matter and gave us nothing in return. Apparently United Airlines does not realize there are reasons as to why people choose the flight schedules they want, or for that matter as to what Airline to use - maybe United does not appreciate our business. When we booked our vacation at the beginning of January we could of used other Airlines, and maybe should have. United was giving bad excuses to our travel agent, and said that we were late in checking our luggage in and they got our luggage at 3:00 pm. This is a totally foolish excuse, as they already had our luggage by 8:30 that morning as we were hoping to get on with the earlier flight. Whomever gave that excuse should rethink their reasoning, as no Airline ever waits for anyone's luggage and they never wait for their customers in arriving on time, so the luggage was not a real excuse. We are seasoned travelers and have traveled to many foreign countries as well as much of the USA. In all honesty, it would appear that customer service in many Airlines in the USA is lacking, as having traveled to other areas in the world we find that those Airlines treat their air travelers much better. Our seats were next to the toilets.",-1
2019-04-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,This is a disgrace,True,"  Newark to Orlando. This is a disgrace. Waiting at the Airport from 12pm today. Got on the assigned flight which was suppose to leave at 4:05 pm had a technical difficulty. Was kept on the flight for two hours only to find out we have to deboard. No crew member knew what the status is. An hour later found out flight got canceled and was given a different flight and gate. Once boarded that flight at 7:30pm only to find out that this flight has a technical difficulty also. An hour later was announced that th iui s flight was canceled too. Its now 10:15pm no news yet. This is a disgrace. I have been flying United for a while, this is my third round trip just this year. This is not what you expect from an well known fight company like united.  I am suppose to attend a meeting at 9am tomorrow morning",-1
2019-04-14,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Vienna via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,what a creepy airline,False,"  Norfolk to Vienna via Washington. My family and me are heading for the spring break to Europe. Due the delay of the flight from ORF to IAD this afternoon, Apr 12th, we missed our flight to VIE for 5 minutes. The next connection even with an additional layover via FRA has delayed us for about 12 hrs and we had to wait with our 7-year old daughter for about 5hrs in Dulles. Hence, I had to feed our family for $80 - and we´re starting much too late in order to catch with our people, who are waiting for us. Asking at the United desk at the C1 gate dealing with the flight to FRA departing at 22.20, UA932, for an upgrade as compensation or a voucher, we were rejected. (""Because we don't do that with kids""!) It´s not the first time that United is performing like that. My frustration is manifest and paramount. I´d pay double the price, if there would be an alternative to your airline. One thing is certain - I´d do everything possible to tell the people what a creepy airline United is.",1
2019-04-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Los Angeles via San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst customer service,True,"  Toronto to Los Angeles via San Francisco. The worst company and the customer service that I have ever experienced. Was charged for the ticket that I persuaded more than I was supposed to, even though the e-ticket was showing an original price. Called the customer service they advise me to go to a bank. Went to my bank, they provided me with all the official information that proves that I was charged more than it was saying on the e-ticket from united airlines. Called the united airlines again, we had an hour and 30 minutes conversation 3 ways with my bank and the United Airlines company itself. They denied the fact that I was charged more, I asked them to provide me with an email where I can send all the proven documents with an official stamp of the bank that I was charged more than I was supposed to. It never happened. Very disappointed. I can’t refund the ticket, I can’t have the extra money that I paid back, nothing. Would never recommend anyone to use this company.",-1

Was forced to use 2x do to last minute flights and both experiences were horrible. Forced us to check a bag when originally not notifying us that only one under the seat carry on was allowed. First experience we were on the phone for hours trying to get a flight when we had a international non refundable flight the next day. They refused to give a family member first class when they cancelled their crew due to overworking them. They refused to book him on another flight and as a result we lost 2500 because he could not travel internationally. Never use this airline.  There was plenary of cabin space when we entered the plane however they insisted on charging us to check my tiny luggage. If you want to be screwed over use this airline.,-1

I just wanted to sit next to my husband and they changed his seat to the back when we were originally sitting together!

When I complained they didn’t even care!,-1
2019-04-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Duluth,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I need to vent about this,False,"  Chicago to Duluth. Worst experience ever: I normally don’t write reviews but I need to vent about this. The flight to my destination (Chicago) was alright. Not the nicest situation but I was okay with that. However, going back was a complete mess. There was a gigantic winter storm occurring in Minnesota, which was where my return flight was scheduled to go to. I assumed that there would be delays, which there were, but they didn’t inform us of this until after our flight was scheduled so I spent all day at the airport just waiting for my flight to get delayed. At this point they rescheduled it for the next morning, which was dumb because the storm was more than likely not going to be done until 1pm the next day, but because it wasn’t large enough of a delay they weren’t going to supply us with hotel rooms or discounts of any sort. Instead, they offered us cots to sleep on in a hallway of the airport. I, being a broke recently graduated college student, took them up on this offer and I really wish I hadn’t... the cots were stained all over and I guess they couldn’t shut the lights off in the hallway or the loud announcements that shout things like “no smoking in the airport” because those are all very necessary to hear at 2am... so as you can imagine I slept horrible waking up every 20 minutes to one of their announcements. It also didn’t help that the staff wouldn’t stop talking. They didn’t care at all that there were people trying to rest. I wouldn’t have cared if they spoke quietly or shut doors to the rooms they were in, but they were practically yelling while socializing. And to top everything off I was awoken to a lovely “4am wake up call.” That’s literally what they yelled at us as they walked down the hallway and they didn’t even give me a minute to get off my cot until they were standing over me waiting to fold my cot up. So I got up, left, and an hour later at 5am I received a text that my flight was delayed till 1pm. Yep. I slept on a cot for nothing and I now have 8 hours to kill and all I really want is a shower and a bed. Oh and they’ve changed my gate 6 times. Overall, I felt less like a customer and more like a prisoner at this airport.",-1
2019-04-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,does not care about customers,False,"  This is the second time I have had few options to fly a certain route so I ended up with United. I was not pleased about this from the start. As expected, United Airlines dropped the ball yet again. They tell me on the same day as my flight that my flight has been delayed nearly three hours because of a mechanical issue that occurred several hours earlier in the day (without an explanation as to why this translates into a delay in my flight) resulting in my inability to make my connecting flight.  So, they basically say you can fly the next day and offer no form of real compensation for the inconvenience (they never do and will fight tooth and nail not to except perhaps in the form of a voucher for another flight with them). This resulted in wasted money and time on Lyfts to and from the airport and an unnecessary delay in the trip. The smug expression on the lady at the airport's face said everything about how little she cared about the inconvenience this had on a customer. Thanks a lot, United. Whenever someone asks me which airline they should fly, I recommend all of your competitors and recommend specifically that they do not fly United if they can avoid it. You know why? Because United does not care about its customers.",-1

We purchased a package ticket, flying to Vegas on Delta (which is a great airline), we were only here for one night so we brought no personal bags and just a SMALL roller bag each. We got to the airport and were told no full sized carry-on bags. Even though my roller bag fits under my seat I guess they qualify any bag with wheels as a full sized carryon. So we had to pay $30 per bag to check each bag. Had I known I would have A) not flown with United because that’s. Scam and B) brought a damn backpack for all my stuff. I will no longer be flying with United. My partner and I are avid travelers and it’s unfortunate to cut an airline out if the repertoire said this to myself every time I fly with United I have a horrible experience. It’s just not worth it. At all.",-1

First off I will never ever fly via United Airlines again. My children were 2 and 4 and you had them sitting on opposite sides of the plan away from their mother.

Literally the worst experience of my life with a Airline. I fly over a 100 segments per year and have come to understand and appreciate the issues of the airline. But it began when the flight I was booked on to Houston was going to be delayed for 4 hours and would cause us to miss our connection. I realize this happens. I called Customer service was I was on line with them for 3 hours and 7 minutes, where they proceeded to let me know that the only option I had was to move my flight by a day and because premium economy was full, I would need to go to regular economy. Twice I was on hold for 40 minutes and I had to call in on a separate line to see if we had been disconnected. I have never never had a worse customer experience in my life, never.",-1

I have had horrible experiences with United over the years. Today however was a much better experience. The flight attendants were kind and welcoming. We fly with our 4 kids about 3 times a year. Today is the first time in years they were invited to the flight deck to say hello to the captain. We still managed to take off in time even with a late boarding due to maintenance. If this is how they function as an airline then they have certainly turned the corner on their previous challenges.,1

I have recently flown from the USA to eastern Europe and have flown on a plethora of different flight carriers, but found United to be the least accommodating and the staff was rude.

On original flight, staff were too lazy to pick up the trash more than once during the flight. There was trash in seats and on floor from previous flight, we had no choice but to leave our trash on the plane. Once in Houston they changed our gate at the last minute only to delay the flight for hours to clean plane and to get next flight crew through security. I flew Spirit a year ago and had a better experience. United is nothing more than a budget airline anymore with their new baggage policies and customer satisfaction.

Business class check in at Newark is a very poor self service experience - it’s unclear, unhelpful and few staff around to assist. Also travelling business class out of terminal C gives no express lane benefits through security so be prepared for a long queue. From there it improves, the United Polaris lounge is excellent with good food and very comfortable. Showers too. Onto the flight, goodness the aircraft are old. But, they are comfortable and the seats in business are quite good. Food and drinks perfectly acceptable. And ticket cost reasonable. All in all a great option in and out of Manchester to USA which saves on travelling time to London Heathrow for anyone who, like me, is North based.",1

If I could give an airline negative stars I would - this is my single worst experience with an airline. First, they're no bags policy on some flights really does put them in the economy airline category. None of their kiosks we're working and there was only two representatives. I was told that I had to check a bag (I had a very small purse) even though it was backpack sized. Then because it was less than an hour before my flight (45 min) they said they couldn't take my bag that they were making me check. I swear that the attendant acted happy about this. I had to book a new flight for my vacation and I will never be flying United again. I'm perfectly capable of saying when I was wrong but the handling and customer service was crazy - they're trying to squeeze every last dime out of customers.",-1

Along with travel voucher to take us to Tokyo Haneda airport. My wife and I were quite relieved , thinking we would have to stay in Japan and rebook a flight next day (lost time and hassle of trying to reschedule our remaining travel.) UA did a good job of taking care of the passengers on this flight. Our returning flights we received an unexpected upgrade/surprise to be seated in their Economy Premium Plus section, and priority boarding on our last leg. We have flown UA for the last 5 years on international flights and are very satisfied with the service we have received.",1
2019-04-05,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to St. Louis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly this airline,True," I am posting this review after several attempts to resolve my issue with United Airlines. We flew from St. Louis to Denver on March 9. Our return flight on March 14 was canceled due to lack of crew, which was understandable given that a major storm had canceled over 1000 flights the day before. Our luggage, however, was flown on to St. Louis without us on a different plane. There were so many flight cancellations and issues that our first available flight home was 3 days later, on March 17. United refused to compensate us for expenses incurred due to being separated from our bags because we do not fit the typical baggage delay case. If an airline recognizes that compensation is warranted for clothes and toiletries when bags are delayed, should not the same be true when your luggage flies on without you? I will never fly this airline again.",-1
2019-04-04,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Austin to Tokyo via Manila,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,shout out to the gate agents,False,"  A shout out to the gate agents working the United desk this morning at Austin Bergstrom, Gate-32. A broken plane seriously disrupted my routing to Manila (Austin, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Guam, Manila). Y The team quickly found me a seat on a DC bound flight with onward routing to Tokyo then Manila - with a slightly earlier arrival time. Great to see awesomeness in action!",1

Reviews are not something I normally write but I feel compelled today 04/03/19. I Flew United and nothing was above a normal flight until my flight to Raleigh. Our flight attendant went above and beyond to make the flight a comfortable experience for everyone. A true professional who deserves to be recognized for their hard work.,1
2019-04-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Reno,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst experience ever,True,"  Nashville to Reno. Worst experience ever! Flight was delayed for 1.5hr waiting for clearance.  Which happens, I guess. But when we landed no luggage. We were informed that our luggage was on another plane & would not arrive until 3pm. We arrived at 11:30am. We were told that our two luggage would be delivered to the home that we are visiting. They said it would go out for delivery at 5:30pm & we could expect it no later than 9:30 pm & if it was not delivered by 10pm to call back. We went & ate & killed time & call back at 4:30pm asking if it was there yet & could be just come & pick it up. We were told No because everyone had already left for the day in baggage claim. By 10:15 no luggage so we called & they said it was still there & we could expect it in the morning. Well it is now 12:30pm & we still have No luggage & no one seems to know where they are or even care.",-1
2019-04-02,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Orlando via  Newark,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,5,staff went above and beyond,True,"  We were flying to Orlando through Newark for our wedding and the staff went above and beyond to make our trip wonderful. First of all, they allowed me to put my wedding gown into one of the closets on each flight so it didn’t have to be in the overhead. We had been seated behind one another on the first leg of our trip and a stewardess got another passenger to trade so we could be together. She was truly so kind and took great care of us. The entire staff on that first flight were amazing. We appreciate you guys!",1
2019-04-01,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Santiago de los Caballeros to Newark,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,bird size bag size,False,"  Santiago de los Caballeros to Newark. My last flight with United Airlines was on March 20th 2019. It was horrible, I went in vacation to D.R and went on JetBlue, really nice. However my come back flight was through United Airlines horrible experience. I had a carry on bag and I couldn’t carry my bag with United Airlines I had to pay almost $50 dollars plus 33.50 for my regular size baggage about $84.00 total. The seats are very tight, no TV and to top it off you get a bird size bag size. The worst airline I’ve flew. I will keep this on my mind when buying an air flight ticket in the future.",-1
2019-03-31,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Springfield to Chicago,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3,inconsiderate of their patrons,False,"  Springfield to Chicago. I have been flying only this airline for a few of years now, mainly because I’m a member of their frequent flyer program. The experience has been more often then not quite negative. United tends to change gate frequently and a lot of times at the last minute. I have missed two flights because of this and almost just missed a third. Not only do they change gates but they completely fail to alert you about his fact until it’s almost too late and one has only minutes to catch the flight at the other gate. The attendants attitude also is poor and at time down right rude. The seats have hardly enough leg room but I’m am 6’1” so maybe I was just born too talk to be comfortable in airline seats. One of the perks of being a frequent flier member was that you could pick your seats, at least in the economy-section without paying extra. Nowadays if you pick any seat you have to pay extra. Apparently the membership fee is not enough. Bottom line is they are very inconsiderate of their patrons and their staff portrays the companies attitude. If you can afford another airline go to that one, I’m certainly switching who I fly with from now on. The cheaper flight are just not worth the massive headache anymore.",-1
2019-03-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Newark,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,4,ticked off by agent's rudeness,True,"  Really ticked off by agent's rudeness. I was booked roundtrip Newark to Houston on a last-minute Basic Economy ticket. First flight was just fine on American, which allows one carry on in the overhead bin (bag maximum dimensions are clearly spelled out on AA's website) and one beneath the seat. Great, as I only had two small bags. Not so great on my return flight home on United. On checking in at UA's Houston/IAH kiosk I realized the airline's impossibly stingy policy that allows only one small bag under the seat - and nothing overhead. Okay, my fault for assuming United's policy was the same as American's. What really burned me though was the downright surly response from UA's customer service agent when I questioned why I had to pay a $30 bag check fee. He was really aggressive - glaring as he shouted ""my problem was that I was cheap!"" I was insulted, but paid the fee nonetheless. But I'm done with United. We've flown many miles together - too bad United's skies are no longer friendly. From now on I'm happy to stick with better carriers American and Delta.",-1
2019-03-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Boston via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,3.0,1,Their flights are junk,False,"  I reserved a flight from San Jose to Boston and the initial flight has cramped seat and experienced heavy lower back pain. I struggled till I got down at Chicago. Now I had a second frustrated experience of connecting flight cancellation. They first messaged that the flight is delayed and then cancelled the connecting flight due to technical issues. My total travel plan screwed up and struck in Chicago. I called them later date and asked for a resolution. The representative held me up wating for 20 mins and finally said that he can refund partial amount. I asked him whether he can put me back on my initial departure location and he again held me waiting and spoke to higher authorities and finally said it's possible and we are at the verge of reserving my flight back to location where i started. I opted for seat preference and the guy told me to wait again and came back after couple of minutes and said that they can't make this reservation at all. We had conversation against the assured resolution and finally ended up with no resolution at all. I spoke to the higher supervisor with whom he was talking before and she said that they gave me misinformation providing me with the refund process application. The whole episode lasted an hr on call due to their ignorance of the customer issue and lack of knowledge and professionalism in whatever they do. I ended up missing my flight and appointments sheduled and with total loss of time, money and peace of mind. They don't want to resolve customer issues as far as possible. Their flights are junk. They have no professional knowledgeable staff or Representatives. I will never ever travel again with United Airlines!",-1
2019-03-31,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Spokane,2.0,,4.0,,,4.0,1,never fly this airline again,True,"  Chicago to Spokane. On the flight. All passengers onboard. 8pm Friday night and everyone would just like to be home. Waiting on the runway for late passengers. In 30 years of flying, hundreds of flights, I have never had an airline hold a plane for me - even when on a late connection with the same airline. Who is so special that they hold a flight 30+ minutes for them? The airline either needs to wait for late passengers every time or never. This experience made me want to never fly this airline again - I have a lot of choices.",-1
2019-03-29,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SeaTac to Houston via Pensacola,2.0,,4.0,,,4.0,1,pay to check my backpack,True,"  SeaTac to Houston via Pensacola. Bought economy ticket. Assumed i would not be able to bring a bag on because the overhead bins would have limited space. Ended up having to pay to check my backpack because of dimensions, meanwhile it would have easily fit under the seat in front of me or one of the numerous empty overhead bins. They only didn't want me to be able to bring a bag so they could charge me 30 dollars flat for checking a backpack.. This increased the cost of my ticket by roughly 15 percent. Saw this happen to at least 3/5 of the other people check-in in near me. Added check In time, possibility of missing bag, and pickup time on far end of my flight for no reason. Scam ticket prices for the basic economy so they can attempt to compete with legit airlines on price. Will not be flying with this company again. Their prices are basically false advertising. Feel bad for their customer service employees, cause I'm sure the line level eats all the stress of the CEO/execs eating profits.",-1
2019-03-29,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Washington to London,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4,few disappointments,True,"  Washington to London. Thankfully, on this particular flight United's business class was the new Polaris configuration, which is about 100% better than its pre-historic 8-across business class configurations. So, right off the bat, things were moving in a positive direction. And there were few disappointments. Service was friendly, efficient and pleasant on the flight and on the ground on both sides of the Atlantic. United's arrival lounge in Heathrow is such a nice touch! My only complaint would be that the meal was not up to previous standards I have experienced on United's international business class (even in the pre-historic business class). The pre-packaged meals look and taste as though they are - pre-packaged. Moreover, while upgrading the seating environment, it seems UA has chosen to downgrade some of the amenities. For example, the amenities kit is pretty sparse compared to those previously offered. No more plated meals, no more mimosa carts, no wine tastings, no chocolates.",1
2019-03-29,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Newark,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,attendant was very helpful,True,"  Rome to Newark. On our flight, we had a school of students flying with us and a couple other difficult guests flying with us. All the flight attendants were lovely but there was pne flight attendant who was with us for our flight out to Italy on March 19th, 2019 was so wonderful. Very accommodating, helpful & really did her best to keep everyone happy & safe. The school kids all kept getting up and having a hangout session throughout the plane during the whole flight. I know everyone around me and my fellow friends flying back home were very displeased with them and how uncontrolled they were by their chaperone. As I imagine most passengers felt on this flight with them. The attendant was very helpful in trying keep the rest of us content and comfortable with our flight and all of them. Hope to see her again on my next flight. Side note: never seen a plane be left in the condition I saw today. No respect for the airline. Or the attendants for that matter from a few of the students.",1
2019-03-29,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Cleveland,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3,cabin was not clean,False,"  Dallas to Cleveland. The cabin was not clean and I was dismayed to see that the air intake was dirty and possibly had mold or mildew on it. The flight was fine otherwise despite having some repairs needed, the captain’s oxygen mask had to be replaced causing a delay and the engine to run the airplane on the ground was broken so they had to wait to start the main engines at the gate to taxi. Nothing to cause any worry about safety.",1
2019-03-28,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to Chicago O'Hare,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,was less than helpful,True,  Tampa to Chicago O'Hare. Started getting texts early morning for a slight delay after 6 throughout 7 hours our flight delayed 5 hours and all they offered were free snacks. Our entire day was wasted sitting in Tampa airport waiting for a plane to show up. Their customer service desk was less than helpful and sympathetic.,-1
2019-03-28,0.2,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Papeete,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2,sad level of crew service,True,"  San Francisco to Papeete. Paid for premium economy for extra 500 dollars round trip for more leg room and narrow uncomfortable seats for 9 hours. Food was terrible. United airlines needs to improve long haul flights, crew services seat comfort to compete with the likes of air New Zealand, Qantas and similar long haul carriers. We are retired and travel a lot, are very leery to use United airlines in the future for such a long flight to most anywhere in the world. Very sad level of crew service, aircraft seat comfort, quality of food services and similar.",-1
2019-03-27,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Cozumel to Oklahoma City via Houston,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,This airline is horrible,True,"  Cozumel to Oklahoma City via Houston. This airline is horrible. The measly amount I spend on travel isn’t a drop in the bucket to these people and it shows! They know that people have to fly and we don’t have all that many options and they take advantage of that. We were trying to get home to OKC from Cozumel and on our way to the airport from our resort I receive a text that our flight was delayed one hour..ok, no big deal. Get to the airport and I proceed to get three more texts just adding more and more delay time. We end up sitting in the tiny Cozumel airport for 5 hours. Finally get on the plane and the flight attendant is condescending and rude. I asked for headphones and she said “no..I’ve already been up and down this aisle asking 3 times”. That’s untrue, she asked 1 time and I said no because I didn’t realize I’d be able to watch the movie, I thought I would have to pay extra to watch. When I realized I was going to be able to watch, that’s when I asked for headphones. I did it politely and still she spoke to me as though I was a child. We get to Houston and the plane stopped, people thought we were at the gate and proceeded to stand (many people were desperately trying to catch connection..us included), come to find out we were not actually at gate (there wasn’t one available because we were so late) flight attendant comes on speaker and begins to berate those standing up. I get it, it’s a safety issue but a courteous please sit back down, we’re not at a gate would have sufficed. Again, she was condescending, spoke to all of us as if we were idiots. So we ended up sitting on the runway for 20-30 minutes or so and we did indeed miss our connecting flight. We went to customer service (we had already asked to be put on standby for the last flight of the night for OKC) just to be told the later flight was overbooked and we had a slim chance of getting on..my husband had looked on the app and it showed they had three open seats. Told by customer service something along the lines of “those are seats blocked off by travel agents for potential customers”? And to make matters worse, that all flights were full until 9:30 pm the next night! Putting us in Houston for over 24 hours. So apparently customers who have already paid aren’t as important and customers who might possibly book in the future? Makes no sense! I tried to tell them we needed to get home as we have jobs and kids and I was completely out of blood pressure medication. At that point I just wanted to rent a car and drive the 8 hours home. Asked about reimbursement for having to rent a car, it was a no-go. So we crossed our fingers and went to wait and see if we got on on standby (oh I failed to mention, this flight was delayed as well). We got the last two standby seats thank god, however the plane was very old, very uncomfortable and something kept banging under my feet. Needless to say I’m glad it was just an hour home. I’ve never been so glad to have my feet on the ground. I will be using another airline from now on and will suggest all my friends and family do the same. I understand sometimes delays are inevitable (this wasn’t weather related, we were never told what was going on) but the lack of customer service after the fact and the rudeness of the flight attendants is enough to turn me completely off of United.",-1
2019-03-27,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Chicago via Nebraska,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,Customer service is mediocre,False,"  Customer service is mediocre. Staff through and through were rude and not helpful at all. Don't ask any questions; if you need to do so, better to ask the stranger next to you. I'm sure not everybody working there is like that, but there's such a negative air provided there.",-1
2019-03-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Chicago,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2,reps had absolutely no clue,True,"  Worst experience ever! 9 hour flight and offered two glasses of water and one ounce of pretzels. For $1400 you would think that in nine hours you would get a meal. But the bigger problem was the return flight from Maui to Chicago on United flight 348. The flight got canceled due to mechanical problems. No hydraulics, I get that, you cannot fly then. But these things happen and there should be protocol in place. 300 + people stood in lines for hours trying to find their luggage, trying to book a new flight or trying to get vouchers. After 90 minutes in line 3, the voucher line, she finally starts handing them out, only to run out of vouchers after three passengers. The luggage line after 2 hours hadn’t moved hardly any people. Three reps from United had absolutely no clue what to do. People who had to stay overnight and needed to retrieve their luggage were sent on a wild goose chase all over the airport. Three hours after the flight was supposed to have left, the agents at the check in gates, overwhelmed and utterly confused, finally started, with three baggage claim checks at a time, disappeared for 15-30 minutes at a time to retrieve 3 bags. It took forever. It was so poorly handled! These mechanical failures can happen but these people should have been kind, apologetic, professional and above all helpful. They were not. A bad situation became out of control and every guest left (some are still there!) frustrated. We are in Maui, so another night is no heartbreak, but $10 vouchers for meals, seriously!",-1
2019-03-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Baton rouge,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,Worst airline ever,True,"  Houston to Baton rouge. Had an hour delay out of my control and it put me 16 hours behind, the airline would not help me with a room or food. Even though I paid for all of the insurance possible. Now I am sleeping in a chair by myself all night worried some one will still my bags. Worst airline ever. Very unsafe for a solo traveler.",-1
2019-03-24,0.9,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Honolulu,3.0,,4.0,,3.0,5.0,5,everyone working really hard,True,"  Denver to Honolulu. United gets a lot of bad reviews but honestly when it comes down to it they are amazing. I was flying with my choir when I got stuck in the huge Denver snowstorm that caused DIA to cancel all fights and closed most roads in Colorado. United jump into action with everyone working really hard to get all passengers to their destinations as quickly as possible. Even getting my entire choir on a flight the next day. And when most of their passengers had to sleep on the airport floor due to the road closures, United provided re-usable water bottles with small toiletries (things like deodorant, toothpaste, a small tooth brush, ect.) inside. They also gave out United blankets to help keep everyone warm inside of the cold airport. One United women even brought my group games to play while we were stuck. They made the whole process as stress free as they could for us, and even thought they were stressed everyone seemed to be a good mood.",1
2019-03-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico to Reagan Washington,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,worst experience ever,False,"  This has been the worst experience ever! First our flight was delayed which could’ve been ok however when we landed in Houston we literally had 45 minutes to catch our flight. After going through customs then getting in a line one of the reps told us to get out of line to get in another, once in that line the rep there told us we were suppose to stay in the line we just got out of. Once we’ve made it to our gate which was C40 we were told that they already booked us for another flight even though our flight haven’t left yet. So we had to speed walk all the way back to the other end of the airport to gate E. I’m typing this as I am walking to the gate, hopefully we won’t miss this one. Ok, now we are here at gate E3 and the rep here is saying we need paper work which the attendant at gate C took!  No one here is on the same accord!",-1
2019-03-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Luis Obispo via San Francisco,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,they failed miserably,False,"  Orlando to San Luis Obispo via San Francisco . I have traveled approximately 600K miles in my lifetime, and have recently avoided United because of all their negative customer service evaluations and beaches in the past. Now we have more limited options to travel into the destinations that we visit and chose to give United another chance... well big mistake. Weather delayed our departure 4 hours going into SF, which can happen, but the pilot came on the intercom and suggested; those that would like to deplane could do so, but the gate agent refused to allow that to happen, unless you wanted to give up your seat. Nobody from United would speak to any of the passengers to discuss alternative travel option, even though the pilot said that would happen - it was chaos. Needless to say we missed our connection, albeit by only 30 minutes, so we slept at the airport and boarded our rescheduled flight at 7:30 the next morning. This United flight is now delayed because we are waiting for travelers to be able to make the flight because of their delays, yet the night before they chose to leave many passengers behind, and it was the last flight out to SBP. The wait for us night before would have been less than this morning flight delay, and this morning's passengers had many flight options through out the day to get into SBP. I can also say that there was only one agent for United that was respectful and decent dealing with their customers during this period of time, it was disgusting. We tried United again but they failed miserably. Delta and Southwest here we come!!",-1

I’ve never experienced such a rude flight attendant. She proceeded to give me the wrong direction as to where I sat. Then yelled at me when I had to turn around and find my seat. Not only was I embarrassed but I felt like I was being talked to like a child. Then she proceeded to give incorrect directions to boarding passengers and made them feel dumb as well.

2019-03-22,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Phoenix,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,2,never fly United again,True,"  My boyfriend dropped myself & my 2 kids (11&3) off on Tuesday evening. We are from door county & it took 3.5 hours to get there. My car was running when bf helped us with our bags, and then he left. Long story short, I had my keys & he was stranded 20 mins away because it’s a push to start car & it turned off when he stopped. I asked customer service if there was anyway I could get my keys to the front or lost and found so he could take an Uber to come get them. They said there was literally nothing they could do unless I went back outside and started the whole process over. I said he isn’t here he has to find a way here. They said because he wasn’t a customer & they didn’t know him there was no way to get them to him. I said I could give you a picture, a name, a social, anything. They said “you could fed ex them” I said he is stranded at a McDonald’s while I have my keys 3.5 hours from home. They just kept saying we’re sorry there is nothing we can do. I think this was complete BS. How can someone just not walk to the lost and found where he could pick them up? They wanted me to go back outside to bring them to him, but he was 20 mins away. All in all, I think there was something someone could have done & because of this I will never fly United again.",-1

I had to call to find out my flight was cancelled. No email or courtesy call. When checking into my flight at the airport the lady there was nice but other than that, I would give the flight attendants a zero star rating if I could. I asked for a refill on water and got nothing but attitude and an eye roll. Also, they were super rude about the wifi and simple questions asked throughout my flight. Landing was awful.",-1

I would not recommend this airline to anyone, my flight from San Francisco to Phoenix was cancelled due to weather conditions which I understand there is no control at all. But I at the airport for an additional 16.5 hours, I didn't get any accommodation or food vouchers as that isn't part of their terms, I got a discount voucher but they didn't know how much the discount would be for. I was told to go to the shuttle buses and ask which one takes me to the airport hotels, when I found out it would cost $300/£220 for the night, I went back to the airport to try and find somewhere to go or see instead of pointing me in the directions I was told to look it up on mobile phone and follow my google maps. I ended up being forced to stay in the airport until my next flight was leaving I had no food or water as I only had my English bank card on me and my bank would of locked my account. I was travelling alone they had no sympathy and i felt nothing could be done i didn't know what to do. Overall I believe they could have done more and should have done more to help me.",-1

I am also 6 ft 4 so I like the legroom. Was just told by the stewardess that I would need to wait an hour as I had had 2 drinks. Flying from Denver to Los Cabos. Seriously quiet and composed. A new low.",-1
2019-03-20,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Grand Cayman,1.0,,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1,plenty of room in compartments,True,"  Horrendous! No wonder United has such terrible reputation! I was demanded to check in my carry on piece (it's called carry-on for a reason!) and was charged $30 for it - and it was an international flight! When I boarded the plane, there were plenty of room in overhead compartments. In fact, I've never seen so much empty spaces before! The airline claims it speeds up boarding process (for my $30?). Probably. But after they closed the gate, we stood on runway for an hour and a half. Getting to airport, passing security is already stressful enough, do they have to add to aggregation? Customer service line had 16 people, in 10 minutes I was waiting no one moved, except 3 passengers who gave up and left.",-1
2019-03-19,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Houston,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,thanks for a wonderful trip,False,"  Sydney to Houston. I had the longest flight I've taken and I had a wonderful time. The crew were so pleasant and nice and the food was tasty. The seats were comfortable and the entertainment selections were awesome. What's more is that they were able to get my husband on the same itinerary as me when, originally, he was not on my flight because we booked his flight with points. All we had to pay was a $75 change fee. It made the flight home so much better. They even were able to get us seats next to each other! I've flown United for a while and they have always been very accommodating and I want to give my sincerest thanks for a wonderful trip.",1
2019-03-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Diego to Chicago,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,horrible experience with United,True,"  This is the second time in one month that I have had a horrible experience with United and how they run their business. I understand when things go unexpected, but when there is no one to help you, willing to help you and just plain terrible customer service, it makes everything worse. United employees tend to have no clue what is going on and half of them are simply rude. I experienced employees cursing out customers, walking away from customers and straight up leaving customers on their own to ""figure it out."" Fortunately I was one of the few that was able to get a hotel voucher for my night I spent stuck in Chicago, however when asking how to get there they told me the wrong information for a shuttle or where I needed to go. When I finally got to my destination the next day, I went to pick up my bags in Milwaukee and of course no one was able to be found at the United desk. When asking another airline where I might go to find someone, they replied, ""I am not sure they are never here, I would try to ask ticketing.""",-1
2019-03-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Detroit,5.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,didn't offer me anything,False,"  Houston to Detroit. On this United Airlines flight which I normally don't take, my seat was for 24b but there were a group of guy's that wanted to sit together and asked if I would mind switching seats with them so I did. The problem came when I thought I heard something announced about complimentary drinks and snacks will soon be given to the passenger's. When they begin to pass out the drinks and snacks, I watched as the people behind me and in front of me was given these items and not me, but the stewardess looked me in the face twice but didn't offer me anything. So I stopped her and asked her if I missed something, she said no but asked me if I wanted something to drink as I perceived it to mean to purchase a drink and I said no. So I stopped the other stewardess and said the same thing to her and added was the complimentary for certain assigned seats or people and she said no its for everyone - ""did you want something to drink"" again I was asked when other passengers have more than water, now I'm stewing because she told me that she served those behind me and in front of me and then going to say maybe you were asleep, how can you say that when you're looking me in the face. -It took everything in me to hold my peace.",-1
2019-03-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Austin,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,worst check-in process,True,"  Newark to Austin. The worst check-in process I've ever experienced and I fly regularly. After leaving vehicle in economy at 5:40am and arriving at the terminal (C) by 6a, I had to find my way to a kiosk through the chaotic crowd which I was not sure if I needed to wait in the line or not. If I didn’t force my way to a kiosk and ask the United associate, I wouldn’t have no what process I was expected to follow. Then forced to pay for my bag ($30 now) which was of carry on size because I’ve carried on many other flights (see pic of exact similar carry on bags other passengers were able to bring on without paying). I just do not understand when my bag is the same size as all the other passenger bags, I am asked to check in and pay! Then I had to determine that I needed to wait in a line to check my bag, to find out half way through waiting (20 min now), I needed to wait in a bag drop lines and that was the security line. I know what people are thinking, duh dude, but as chaotic as the terminal was it was unclear what was where because you couldn’t see through the crowds. If they had united associates announcing the procedures for everyone instead of having to be asked, it would have been easier for me. I had to seek out help to figure out what to do and announcing myself to other passengers to avoid the same headache I had for their sakes. Then I get into the security line again (45min) which extended the length of the terminal (C) then to follow, another line for the security checks (at least 25 mins). I barely had time to go to the restroom before walking to my terminal to see my flight boarding (flight departed at 7:30a). Absurd! What you had created today was unnecessary stress for your passengers and I will never fly United again after my return. I just cannot do the frequent headaches and added stress I deal with on nearly every one of my flights.",-1
2019-03-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam Schipol to Chicago O’hare,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,usual horrible service,False,  Amsterdam Schipol to Chicago O’Hare with United Airlines. The usual horrible service and unhelpful staff on this flight. Just asked for some headphones and was told they can’t hand them out until we’re in the air. When I asked why was told that it’s for safety reasons. This despite everyone in the aircraft wearing headphones whilst I’m having this conversation. It’s exhuasting having these nonsensical conversations with United staff. They can never give you a valid reason for any of their unhelpful behavior. It’s like a game where they have to make the flight as miserable as possible for their passengers.,-1
2019-03-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Albuquerque,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"so disappointed with United""
",True," I am so disappointed with United. They canceled our original flight, had us on hold for almost 2 hours (during our vacation), and offered no accommodation. They wanted us to pay over 1000 dollars to get us on a different flight. We finally settled on flying out later, but United did not help with hotel fares, rental car, and any grievance they have caused. They simply did not want to help. We left to go back home 2 days later and had to scramble to figure things out. The people on the phone did not address our concerns. They then proceeded to send us texts about how we should look into changing our flight again. I called them back and again, over an hour wait time just to speak to someone unhelpful. The flight itself did not have screens for entertainment or a meal the way most 4+ hour flights do. United told us last minute right before we took off that we could download the app to get entertainment. Well, after the longest boarding process ever, it seemed pretty rude to let us know right before we take off that in order to get entertainment, we had to download things. They should have let everyone know before hand. The lack of communication, help, and uncomfortable seats have made United the worst flying experience I ever had. Do not fly with them!",-1
2019-03-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Dublin,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Save your money and time,False,  Newark to Dublin. As a traveler I would never go through United Airlines after this ridiculous planning. Not only did they have us sit in the plane for almost 4 hours. They gave out one small water to everyone in that time. No one got to even buy beverages or snacks. Did I mention they didnt even have a pilot to fly the plane? Thank you all so much for wasted over 4 hours out of everyone's trip as well as 3 more hours from MSP airport to Newark. Save your money and your time!,-1
2019-03-16,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Eugene to Denver,5.0,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,1,deciding to avoid United,True,  Eugene to Denver. United now has a class called Basic Economy which is one class below Economy. You can not check In online under basic economy unless you check luggage for $30 each flight. This policy makes for long lines at the ticketing counter due to those who use to not check bags as a time saver. The long lines at the ticketing counter makes it so United does not have enough manpower to check in customers that use to bypass the line causing new added congestion. I have flown 11 flights with United in the past 2 months therefore I am deciding to avoid United until they change the policy to speed up my travel plans in the future.,-1
2019-03-16,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Aspen to Chicago,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,the help I received,False,"  My flight out of Vail, CO was cancelled the night before because of the blizzard that came thru the state. Working with Expedia and United, I was able to have my flight changed to Aspen. Unfortunately, my flight was cancelled another 4 times because of weather. Finally, all airports were shut down for the rest of the day. I was notified about each cancellation. I started out making changes on the app. But, once the airports were closed, it became too complicated to do that way and I needed to speak to an agent. I spoke with someone, on the phone, who was very emphatic to me and did whatever she could to help me. Since I was so close to the Aspen airport, I decided to go in and speak with an agent in person to make the changes. The man I spoke with was so helpful. I was switching from date to date, around to different airports, and went thru a lot of times. He had no problem spending as much time with me as I needed. He was also able to accommodate whenever I needed to change it to. This was a frustrating and exhausting 12 hours that was made much easier by everyone that I dealt with. Weather is out of everyone's control but, it feels so much better with the help I received.",1
2019-03-15,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Jacksonville via Houston,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,most affordable ticket,True,"  United Airlines has provided me with the most affordable ticket to visit my partner twice now. The staff have always been so friendly, and professional. The food is on par with any other airline food I've eaten. I experienced one delay on my trips which was caused by a thunder storm, and I fully appreciate that staff must be kept safe, and nothing could've prevented it. The cheap seats aren't great for sleeping though, so bring a nice neck pillow on a long haul.",1
2019-03-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Portland,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,don't fly United,False,"  San Francisco to Portland. The only thing United's wifi is good for is writing a bad review. They have terrible inflight entertainment because they expect you to pay $10.99 for barely any workable internet connection and require you download a plug in to enjoy movies/tv but make it absolutely impossible to find. So then you're stuck with no entertainment options at an unfair rate. To put in perspective, that's more expensive than my monthly Netflix fee. In addition, unlike other generous airlines, they require you pay for absolutely everything. You might think you are getting a bargain flight, but when checking out, you are required to pay extra if you want to sit with your family, extra if you want a carry-on rather than offering it complimentary, and they charge you for everything else offered on the plane. Surprised they don't have someone waiting outside the door demanding money for toilet paper. Bottom line, it is worth paying a bit more upfront to fly with a different airline than being surprised halfway through your trip when the expenses add up and you're feeling more and more agitated by the second. Cheers and don't fly United.",-1
2019-03-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,3.0,,1.0,,,5.0,1,attendant was very rude,True," Newark to Orlando. Flight attendant was very rude. He wanted my husband and I to pull up our seats for take off and he didn't even ask politely. It was like he was talking to 2 kids. ""Come on come on pull up your seats"" while he made hand gestures that are used for toddlers. He got even louder to attract an audience. Flew many times and the flight attendants were always so polite but this attendant today, I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed. There are a lot of kids on this flight and maybe he was aggitated because of the kids. Worst experience ever. Please coach him.",-1
2019-03-14,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Calgary via Denver,3.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,more than accommodating,True,"  Tampa to Calgary via Denver. Recently; my 3 boys, and I, plus our 2 dogs flew with United. The flight we booked was to travel home to Alberta after missing the ticketing timeline with westjet at baggage & ticket kiosk by less than 15 minutes, they refused to check our bags assuming we couldnt possibly get through security in time. As such we were not issued our boarding passes. So we took the cheapest flight I could find for the next day, with United. (Which was surprisingly reasonable.) There was issue when we first flew out of Tampa, and had to land in Houston and change plains. Once in Houston we were delayed maybe 2 hours, due to weather and we weren't the only travelers being detained because of the winter weather happening in Denver. When we finally arrived in Denver, we had missed our connecting flight and it kinda just gets longer from there due to so many travelers in similar situations. It wasnt pleasant nor was it really avoidable, and despite the several hundreds of people rerouted or detained - I can't thank United for their empathetic response throughout the venture and their commitment to customer service. From the booking and getting my dogs their boarding pass, to rescheduling both in person the first time, to calling and requesting a second choice to have us home a little sooner over the phone, United was cordial and apologetic and more than accommodating. It was an inconvenient couple of days and some issues resulted from the rebooking confusion that were human error, but put right with as much haste as they could. I had insurance for my original flight - and they dismissed me immediately and I tried to communicate with westjet at the time we were to travel on their flight and was rudely told, ""be on time next time."" (Which seems bs, since that plain departed 45 minutes late.) Extra thanks to Donna who dealt with following up on any grievances or issues she could help with after we arrived home. I very much appreciate everyone's extra effort on our behalf, knowing we were not the only ones in the same situation. Our flight home was short and sweet and we were as comfortable as we would have been on any other Express flight.",1
2019-03-14,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cabo San Lucas to La Guardia via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline ever,True,"  Cabo San Lucas to La Guardia via Houston. This is the worst airline ever. The lines were miles long at Newark just to go through TSA. We were a group of 8. Airport staff had to assist us in skipping the line just to make our flight that was boarding in ten minutes. We were literally on a 2 hour line. Our flight was empty because 80% of the passengers missed the flight. On our way back home, we left Cabo and arrived to Houston to connect to get to NYC. Once again Bs! The flight landed and we were on the tarmac for a while waiting for space. People were telling the flight attendants to make a announcement to let the people that have connecting flights off first. They made the announcement last minute, and it didn’t help because once again everyone missed their flights. There was a long line to get a receipt for customs. Then we had to get our bags and recheck them. Houston’s airport needs a AirTran because we ran for miles just to reach our gate. Of course the flight left everyone behind. There’s was only one flight leaving back to Newark. Only two people from my party of 8 was able to fly standby. 80 percent of our flight had to stay the night in Houston. I’ve never seen anything like this before. I would rather fly with Spirit or Southwest! You get to the airport hours before and still miss your flight. I have no idea why they would book connecting flight that they know,  there’s no way possible you can make the connecting flight. How can you make it from one flight to the next and make it through long lines and tsa/get bags/recheck bags/run miles to your gate.",-1

I was very disappointed the Basic fare did not include standard carryons, and I had to pay extra $30 and had to be check in only and not able to bring on the plane. Other airlines basic fares still include carryons as always. But United decided to wanna be like Frontier. I will avoid flying with United again and would advise others to do the same.",-1

United delayed flight from Chicago to Austin by 5 hrs for vessel repairs. United customer service at Chicago was not helpful at all to help arrange another flight. I had an appointment to see a medical specialist and had to reschedule Medical specialist appointment. United Poor maintenance and inspection practices cost will cost me nearly $500 for addition hotel charges, rental car charges, and flight modification charges. United airlines made no offer of attempt to rectify the situation. I will not use United airlines in the future. I can understand sometimes delay issues arise in the airline business, however United Airlines customer service failures should not be overlooked.",-1

Economy passengers were allowed to use the First Class restroom which limited their accessibility and it is something First Class passengers pay more for. This is a recurring theme on this route.,-1

I can't say enough good things about the customer service I received on United Airlines.

My flight to Greenville had a 3+ hour delay and was then cancelled an hour before the flight due to “weather”. First of all the weather is fine so that’s inaccurate but i’m not an expert on that so i guess i can’t really judge that. However customer service at the Washington Dulles airport was rude and dismissive and couldn’t give me basic information on driving distances. I had to look it up myself and i feel that this is inadequate at best. They would not give me an overnight stay so i had to rebook my flight over to Columbia SC which is a great inconvenience for me and my ride.

Kept us on a flight for an hour and a half trying to fix the plane instead of just putting us on a different plane. Deplaned us and scattered us everywhere to try and rebook flights. I rebooked my flight and didn’t get to the counter before the loaded everyone. By the time I got my bag switched over (they have to manually do it through radio instead of having an electronic system) they overloaded the plane and I missed that flight as well. Finally I had to rebook again on 2 connections having me traveling the entire day! Then to top it off, they give me food coupons that weren’t even accepted by McDonald’s! Unbelievable.",-1

I purchased a basic economy ticket. If only I had known. When I went to check in for my return flight tomorrow, I was given an option of getting a voucher if I took a later flight. I would have taken a later flight, as something has come up where I'm visiting, but it would have to have been a bit later than the three flight options presented. I then made the mistake of calling customer service to see if they would help. It only made me more aggravated. You see, even though they have extra seats on the flight I would have gladly taken to free up my seat on their overbooked flight, I was told not only would I not be able to do that, I would be charged a bunch more money - I'd mention the amount here, but I could not hear the supervisor and she seemed annoyed when I asked her to repeat what she said. (I was calling from a good landline, not sure what they use over at UA). I don't envy those customer service reps. I would not want to be representing UA. I have since Googled about them and their customer service and business practices seem to be lacking, to put it mildly.",-1

As you could imagine, lots of people to miss their connecting flights. When I called to get a new flight home I was told there weren’t any to take me to New York until the following day at 2pm. I had to stay in a hotel and was not given my luggage. The United staff I talked to about my hotel fought with each other for 15 mins before helping the customers and then when I got to the counter the lady “helping me” answered a phone call from her son on her cell phone and proceeded to talk to him while I stood there at 11pm waiting for a hotel voucher. The next day the weather was bad and the 2pm, 5pm and 930om were all cancelled. When I finally got home I was told by United that my flight would be refund to my card in 7-10 business day. When it wasn’t I called and wrote numerous online complaints. I was then told that I couldn’t be refunded because the flight was used. I told them I was supposed to be refunded and no one cared and I’m fact they were rude to me when I became upset. Then I was told they would give me a $100 voucher through email in 5 business days but AGAIN I have not received it.  They don’t care about your time or your business.

New York to San Francisco. After my experience with luggage check-in today, I will not fly with United Airlines if possible. 70% of the UA Staff have no compassion to anyone. Mainly rude, impolite, impatient, made personal judgement before asking and high ego. This is my overall experiences after flying with United Airlines. I am giving my comment based on comparing with my regular airlines like Air Canada, Cathy Pacific, British Airways, Lufthansa and Condor Air. Sometimes, I wonder is this part of the training of United Airlines by offering this type of customer experience or it was simply the culture of UA.",-1

Meanwhile all other planes have gotten to their destination of Vail. However, they graciously offered us snacks for our troubles despite our hundreds of dollars in hotel fees and meals. Overall, United Airlines is terrible, you should not fly United.",-1
2019-03-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Williston to Brisbane,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Never flying United again,False,"  Never flying United Airlines again. I recently took a trip from North Dakota to Brisbane and back. United managed to ruin over 60% of my flights. It started on my 2nd flight on the way there. The aircraft was delayed for almost 3 hours and did not take off until it should have been landing in San Francisco. Not only that we as customers were given different reasons as to the delays. One said too much rain for 1.5 hours of the delay and the other said too much wind for the other 1.5 hour delay. Landed in San Francisco the ground was barely wet and there was no wind at all. Get off the plane to the overhead pagers telling us that they are going to close the door for the connecting flight to Auckland NZ, mind you 35 passengers were on the plane late from Denver. Plane gets into NZ late miss my connection and have to sit in NZ for 6 hours until the next flight leaves for Brisbane. Return trip stuck in Denver again. Flight crew lied to passengers said it was weather related when in reality they were out of hours. Given 6 hours in a hotel room to sleep and then back to the airport for the flight to be cancelled yet again. Crew blamed weather and that was a lie. The aircraft they were flying was not the proper aircraft to land on the runway in ND as it had no revers thrusters. Same aircraft as the night before so they lied about twice to their customers. Customer Service desk in Denver was not helpful at all. Had to catch a flight out that night to Bismarck which is 3 hours away from home when I should've been flying into Williston 45 mins away. Land in Bismarck and my luggage was sent to Williston and not moved over onto the proper plane. 3 hour drive back from Bismarck and my luggage should've been delivered to my door and yet it was not. Had to make the delivery company deliver it that night like I had informed Williston United personnel that it needed to be. Had to wait almost an extra 2 hours for my luggage to be delivered when it is a 45 minute drive thanks to slow and lazy delivery service. Wrote to Customer Care and they offered me a lousy 300 dollar flight voucher. They offer up to 1k dollar flight vouchers when they over book a plane yet 300 dollars is acceptable to them after wasting 30 plus hours of a paying customers life?? United has 100 percent lost my business and I will make sure I inform everyone I know to choose other Airlines. I am writing this so that if anyone considering flying United Reads this to be aware and to stay away from them as they will Lie to you without issues and they will do absolutely nothing to make things right when they provide horrible service and cause you to be late getting to and from your destinations. They simply do not care as a Corporation about their Customer base.",-1

I was harassed on 3 different occasions by 3 different United employees to check the size of my bag. At the 3rd time I made the comment that this is ridiculous and was told because I purchased a basic economy ticket that I would probably continue to be harassed until actually on board the aircraft and also said if I still didn’t like it that she could call a supervisor if needed. I fly first class to Hawaii twice a year and have never been talked to or treated like that ever by an airline strictly based on the status of my ticket. United Airlines you just lost my business forever. If you could treat people like lower class citizens solely based on the class of ticket then you don’t deserve my business or anyone else’s.,-1

Our departure flights were cancelled and we transferred to American Airlines who did a great job getting us to our destination in comfort. However, we ended up getting to Cancun at 1:30 am. We had a great vacation- but unfortunately flew United back. The crew from Cancun were quite rude and when we got to Denver we were delayed again!

I booked my reservation 3 months in advance with seat assignments (2 aisle seats across from each other). United oversold the flight and reassigned our seats to be middle seats, 7 rows from each other. This is totally unacceptable to us and we told the lady that. She said that it’s the best she could do like she was doing us a favor. What a joke on us. Avoid this airline if you can, they don’t care about people.",-1

Thank you to the kindness of United Airlines employees. On February 13 at 2pm the woman (who was on the VIP line), helped me with respect and kindness and the whole staff at United was great. I was on my 3 month MD Anderson Cancer Center treatment trip. I always fly in on a Tues and leave the next day (Wed) for medical treatments. There is a lot of stress involved with this quarterly trip and I will not go into that. In any event, I was in my Uber on my way back from MD Anderson to the airport and I had to call United because I was having an error checking in online. I actually was taking the trip to NYC instead of Rochester because the flights were to high and because of my medical situation, I am limited financially and need to be very frugal about my trips for my treatments. So I decided it would be cheaper to fly into NYC, vist the night with a friend and take the train the next day! In my call to United from my Uber, we realized that I had booked the trip back home on March 13th instead of Feb 13th. I had never noticed the error. The United employee on the phone said she could book me for a later flight that day but it would be $700 additional dollars on top of my flight. (I purchased the flight insurance because of fear of problems but since the error was on my end, I'm sure I wouldn't have been helped by the insurance.) In any event, I told her I would just talk to someone when I got the airport but she did say they wouldn't do any better!. I was beyond stressed as with the whole medical situation and having to travel alone and the cost the quarterly trips take with hotels and travel etc. I went to talk to the United employee who was at the Airport and when I started to explain what happened, I just lost it. I went to pieces. And I am the type of person who never cries in front of anyone, let alone in a public place.I couldn't even explain what happened I was too upset. In any event, I was treated professional and so kindly at the United desk. This woman and her manger (not sure who was either) really helped me. They worked something out for me and I was able to take the same flight that I thought I was booked on and it just so happened it was somewhat delayed so the timing was perfect. I can't express how much that helped me that day and how much I appreciate how I was treated!!!Thank you United Airlines! If cost permits, I will stay loyal to your airline because of how decently I was treated.",1

I was surprisingly impressed with United! It was my first time flying with them, but I have to say it was a great experience. My flight to Newark was small and packed, but the flight attendants made it comfortable. Our connecting flight to Palm Beach was delayed (by 4 minutes) which really wasn’t too bad, only the last minute gate change all across the airport. Once we finally boarded and took off, the flight attendants were extremely nice and kind, and it made me anxiety of flying completely disappear. Also, the Boeing had TVs, I was not expecting that! Snacks could be more varied, but I don’t usually eat on planes anyway. We got to our destination on time, and safely, and that’s all that matters.",1

We always choose United over Spirit because of the allowance of Carry on bags. We're not sure this basic economy vs regular economy is new but it does not allow carry on bags. Which caused a lot of confusion. We trying to change our seating to regular economy at the front counter they said they could not from there area but to try at the boarding gate. We get to the boarding gate and we were told it's 130 for 2 carry on size bags rather than the 60 it would have been out front! We were a bit upset and ready to say forget United from now on but the gate representative did some serious service recovery. She was patient and kind. From now on we will always check our bags in the front and be sure to not get basic economy. We will fly United again. Thank you .,1

No crew ready to take over flight from Denver to St. George, resulting in delays, resulting in cancelled flight due to weather that could have been avoided by having a crew available to stay on time. This resulted in 19 hours overnight in airport. Next flight to Phoenix, we were sent back and forth to gates 3 different times - again, late flight resulting in running to change terminals in Phoenix to change airlines - made it by 3 minutes.

Crew pulls back to gate and re-opens to let late passengers on. Then pull back out, now snowing heavy in CO and we have to go through a full de-ice. Huge delays and very frustrating. Especially, since we rushed once from a connecting flight and they had just closed the gate. Plane was still there but we were told it is against Federal Regulations to open the door once it is closed. Guess we were lied to. Flight prior to this one was to ATL for SuperBowl, due to engine trouble we had to wait a til the next day to fly and missed out on some events. No accommodations made, just “nothing we can do”. I am done flying United. Fix your customer service, and if you have issues accommodate passengers or find them flights on other airlines and by all means with inclement weather make good decisions. Do not delay and put people at further risk.",-1

First in the line at Tampa a question was asked if any military dependents were flying, yes was the answer so we waited with a giant flashing red light while staff looked at us and continued to ignore us and help even others who had come way after us, only to find out that because the military member wasn’t flying it didn’t matter. So we waited for nothing and why is that even a question? Then when printing my ticket the United Employee who had ignored us the whole time grabs the baggage stickers and sets them aside by someone else’s luggage! Luckily my fiancé noticed and got the attention of a different employee and she apologized for the other employee and put our stickers on in front of us. The flight attendants leaving Tampa were nice at least. We arrive in Chicago, our connecting flight, which we had an hour, but was cut short due to the plane waiting forever, (we as in myself and my 6.5 month old) I change his diaper and put him him the carrier and follow all the signs located in what looks like an area only United flights are...the signs lead me to another security line. Why am I doing this again when I’m trying to catch a connecting flight? The answer the United employee gave me was that I followed the wrong signs.  So here I have to go through this again and at this point my plane boards in 10 minutes and I still have to go through security again just to get to the plane. The TSA lady saw I was in distress and helped me as she asked how long I had. Made it to the plane just in time. Again, the flight attendant was very nice. Get to Green Bay, get off the plane and go to the baggage claim where everyone waited almost an hour before bags even started coming. Guess what? Mine are no where in site (one bag and a car seat). Go to the United Ticketing area and no one was there, multiple people at the other airlines and none at the one I needed. Another employee said she was probably in the back and points to the door, we go and look, I see my bags, no employee. Finally a different flight line employee goes and gets her and she comes out rudely as if I’m disturbing her. Get my bags and I’m finally on my way to my destination. I guess since my bags had a car seat they kept them elsewhere, but failed to tell me that? This did not happen when I flew American. But it doesn’t end there. Apparently United chose my bag, the one with the car seat, to go through. Broke a few of my things and some of the bathroom items were out of the bags they were put in to prevent any leaking. My stuff was all messed up and I know they went through them because they left a card saying they did. I'm dreading flying back with them.",-1

I have used United services before and I had OK experience. This time was different. Honolulu to Los Angeles: there was no media device on the plane. Overall this is a flight over 5 hours - media device was something expected by all passengers. Couple of the flight attendants were very rude - I understand it's not very easy to work with so many people during a flight but being polite is still part of the service Los Angeles to Boston : this time the flight attendants were super sweet and polite but my negative opinion is based on one of the united rules that I was not familiar with : I ordered glass of prosecco (aware of the fact that I will pay for it ) and I was told that Prosecco could be served only if you are in 1st class! So if you are not flying 1st class you can only order and pay for a glass of chardonnay or cabernet. This might sound silly but what kind of a policy is that. You can't purchase something that is already for sale, because you do not belong to 1st class?",-1

Because of the amount of flying I do, I have a Priority status. On several of my flights this year, entertainment was accessed only via the app on a cell phone. However, the connectivity did not work nor did the plug-ins for power to run a mobile phone or laptop. My last flight was to Denver on a ski trip. Even with my ski and duffle bags marked ""priority"", it took two hours from landing to get my bags. My impression is that UA baggage is understaffed (and also underpaid) where customer service is critical. Counter agents were pleasant enough, constantly apologizing for the delays. I am seriously considering changing my carrier selection. I have had enough.",-1

They canceled the flight for some mysterious ATC delays that only seemed to affect United, because I was able to book another flight immediately to get my daughter here. Still inconvenienced by 1 night by the way. United tried to book her on a flight 2 days later. Most ridiculous thing I've heard of. Altogether different, but I always said after that video came out of United personnel removing that man forcibly from the plane. that I shouldn't book flights on United anymore. Now I have more of a personal reason. Weather is fine, but couldn't somehow find a way to get my daughter here until 2 days later. No thank you.

The airport staff were indifferent, no offer of anything, not that I expected much after the last United flight (out of EWR) that we were on.

This was disgusting from the booking process. I am a high status star alliance member. But get treated poorly from beginning to end. Their website is a broken mess. I was absolutely unable to make the booking on the website. So I ring in. The price immediately goes up. They force me to do a currency conversion. But then just up the price. And charge me in USD at a higher price. Then I have to pay international fees anyway. But they don't charge me once. 8 times on this one flight I have now had. And the person messes up the booking so bad I have had to make many many phone calls to try fix it. I almost missed the flight because of incompetence of the check in staff. And again I am high status star alliance. So was at the premium check in desk. Came within minutes of missing the flight because of staff incompetence. Didn't get lounge access. Gate staff were surly and uncommunicative. I was trying to find out when the flight would actually take off. To go buy food or visit the toilet. Absolutely unsuccessful. Not bording star alliance customers with United star alliance customers. Entertainment system was broken. Power plug was broken. I paid extra for this SMH charging for services and not rendering. The flight was so late I almost missed my connection. There was absolutely no support from staff to assist me getting to my next flight. Missed the lounge again Same issues at gate. Staff just don't care. With the previous issues I had really hoped to go buy some food and visit a toilet. All of this was quite a way to go. So I sat at the gate. Broken seat. Extremely uncomfortable seat. Broken entertainment. The food. If you could call it that. Was disgusting. It really is the worst food I have seen on international flight. Couldn't even get a snack. I really enjoyed 30 hours without food and barely a toilet Break. United used to be the best. But are now the very worst.,-1

Customer service was not good, the way my ticket was printed, it showed my husband's name on both tickets. The guy who checked our boarding pass was extremely rude and made us feel stupid for the way our tickets were printed on the check in computers. Once we got to the gate a part of the seating area was closed and there weren't enough sits for people. There is no lounge that allowes individuals with platinum American Express to use it.

The other guy who was assigning the seats kind of he had the same temper and reactions. We were the first there waiting for our seats to be assigned. Checked with the agent and being told just wait and will call you. Flight no. UA1158 scheduled at 8:10, we got called at 7:55 to be informed that we will have 2 separate seats!!!

2019-02-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,suck every single penny out of you,True,"  San Francisco to Chicago. I have never encountered a company that wants to suck every single penny out of you, I couldn’t bring carry-on so had to pay to check a bag each way. I was late because of traffic but still before the flight and they told me it was too late to check my bag so they forced me to pay 75$ to get on the next flight or his exact words “just make the bag smaller”. I’m sorry I can’t just make things magically smaller.",-1
2019-02-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Washington DC,1.0,2.0,4.0,,1.0,1.0,1,scam you out of $55 at the gate,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Washington DC. Basic Economy: Beware! Even if your bag fits under the seat, the box the airline uses to verify the size of your luggage is smaller than the area under the seat, and United will try to scam you out of $55 at the gate and force you to gate-check your bag -- even if the United attendant at the counter issues you a boarding pass, and has no problem with your bag. That is probably because they only charge $30 at the counter if you decide to check your bag then- but squeeze an additional $25 out of you for any bag they force you to check at the gate. I was stopped halfway down the breezeway, after the gate attendant had already scanned my boarding pass and told me to have a good flight. I was ready to throw away my belongings before I would allow United to scam me out $55. Fortunately, the attendant eventually let me board with my small backpack. I had already spent $17 to UPS some of my belongings home, so my luggage contained even less than when I had flown TO my destination. That was also Basic Economy on United -- and neither the counter attendant nor the gate attendant had had any issue with my backpack for that flight. I will never again fly United. Other airlines have Basic Economy -- but those rules are much less restrictive and those carriers do not treat their passengers nearly as poorly. United treats you like chattel. Also: my ticket was not even inexpensive!!! I had already paid more than I usually do for a ticket to Fort Lauderdale, which was why I had decided not to upgrade from Basic Economy or pay extra for luggage. Expensive ticket, very little luggage allowance, no choice of seat, and terrible treatment by the airline employees in the airport.",-1
2019-02-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Memphis to Vancouver via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,United Airlines customer review,True,"  Memphis to Vancouver via Chicago. This is just one incident of many that have made me believe this is the worst airlin. Delays, long lines, rude hostesses, and 45min+ wait ties on calls and pulling teeth for legit refunds. Not to mention their non-existent inflight entertainment app is a joke that never works and when it does, feels like it was developed by a 12 year old in a basement, it's that horrible. These guys have made me miss holidays, family events, and so much more. I am sworn to never fly United again. I don't care if I have 3 connections and it takes 3x as long, I will never put myself through the pain and suffering of flying this miserable excuse of an airline.",-1
2019-02-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,Avoid them at all cost,True,"  Cancun to San Francisco. The absolute worst airline I have ever flown. I booked these flights months ago and have literally had nothing but problems since. To start out after well over twelve hours between on the phone and Facebook messenger (because god forbid they actually respond on the post they send you a private message to try and resolve. After all this time they said they had everything fixed then when we go to finally start our vacation they changed seats on my wife and I and we were no longer together (oh yeah and they were no help again) next flight was fine from Houston the Cancún. Leaving Cancún to San Francisco they told us to just keep our Duty Free with us that they didn’t need it. Upon arriving to San Francisco we are told we have to collect our bags and recheck them - and we have to be able to fit 4 bottles of alcohol in 1 checked bag that was already over stuffed. (United also charges for every checked back so no I know why, they get to make another 50.00 for an additional checked bag), after being sent to several different representatives by United personnel we ended up 30 minutes later back to the same one who gladly checked another bag (at that wonderful charge) My United Mileage Plus card will be cancelled tomorrow. United Airlines is absolutely horrible, they will take more and more and give the consumer less each time. Oh by the way Cancún to San Francisco left at almost 6:00 p.m. and was 6 hours they didn’t even offer a snack. Avoid them at all cost look around there are much better airlines.",-1

There were issues with the plane to Plattsburgh NY when arriving on flight from Orlando. We had to wait 5 hours for mechanics to arrive from Detroit.

2019-02-12,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to Houston,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,4,flight attendants did a good job,False,"  Sydney to Houston. I was told that I could use either the Singapore or Air New Zealand Lounge. I chose the Singapore Lounge and enjoyed the bacon and eggs and Champagne at 9:45 am. The Business cabin seating is 2-2-2, which makes sleeping on one's side and back comfortable but very tight when sleeping on my front. There was an excellent selection of movies to chose from. The salad was very small and no food was served for a good eleven hours--just lunch after takeoff and breakfast before landing. I would suggest more options in the galley. The fasten seatbelt sign came on many times during the flight with the recorded announcement, ""please fasten your seatbelt."" I was really happy that they did not make announcements in a second or third language which can make sleeping with United very difficult. The flight attendants did a good job and had a sense of humor but it was an older crew. The flight arrived 20 minutes late so I only had 40 minutes go through Immigration and Customs, claim my suitcase, go through security and transfer from Terminal E to Terminal C for my next flight to Orlando, but I boarded with Group 5 and made the flight.",1

I have never seen some thing like this in my life. They have changed the flight schedule 6 times so far (I’m still at the airport and still there is a possibility for another change). At the beginning departure from DC was at 8:25 am then changed respectively to 10:00 am, 12:20, 12:40, again 12:20, 12:45 and finally 1:30pm and God knows if they are gonna change it again or not because right now the time is 1:35pm and they have not announced any thing for boarding yet.

I had many bad experiences with this airlines but today was the worst till date. I had an email/text saying that they might experience delays and I called customer service for alternate options and nothing seemed to workout and so I decided to cancel the flight and go ahead with some other options available and they said they won’t refund until they cancel the flight and they gave me the worst options and made me stay at the airport for almost 12 hours transferring here and there almost 5 times delaying all my plans planned ahead,-1

We sat on the airplane for 2 1/2 hours with incorrect and misleading updates coming every 30 minutes. We were told that the airplane needed an oil change and that we would only be delayed 30 minutes. After missing my connecting flight I went to customer service and was told if I hurry I can make it to the flight that was still boarding to make it to my destination. Was turned away at the gate saying they didn’t make accommodations for everyone on my previous flight. When I expressed that I was directed to that gate from customer service I was told that the previous person was mistaken and I was going to have to wait until 2:45. Putting me at my final destination 5 hours behind schedule. Making me miss my ride and events planned ahead of time. Board and crew were nice on the first flight but all of the misscommunication between what was going on while we sat on the tarmac and once getting to the Houston airport was awful.,-1
2019-02-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Oklahoma City to Washington,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,bad luck of flying with United,True,"  Oklahoma City to Washington. Today I had the seemingly bad luck of flying with United.  After getting to the airport I found out my flight was cancelled. Once I found out I went to the nearest United ticket counter but on the way ran into a gate agent who said ""you should have known the flight was cancelled since 1pm."" I responded sorry I was at work I didn't know.  She tells me her plane is arriving which wasn't at the gate refused to help and does a slight jog to the gate and tells me to go back through security to the ticket desk.  Once I get to ticketing outside of security the agent simply keeps repeating that ""flight is cancelled due to weather"".  She reluctantly says after me asking repeatedly what does that mean, that I have to get myself a hotel for the night. She doesn't offer me any kind of information on how or who to call. She just ask if i was from there and I said no. After I ask another agent what does this mean she hands me a pink form with number and how to get a hotel. I then go back through security and once I look at the board I see a flight that will get me out of OKC with these very unhelpful United Employees. I call customer service and they rebook me on the IAH flight so I can get out of OKC and guess whose gate it is... The gate agent who says she was so busy even though the plane had not arrived and was being very dismissive The agent on the phone checked me in and I had them on speaker phone. I explained that to her and she goes policy is we can't let you on the flight because it's too close to departure. The same lady that told me I should have known in our previous encounter says says ""you should have called earlier."" I emphatically explain how when I'm checked in already and I'm on the phone with a United Employee. He was on speakerphone ""are they not letting you board? You are checked in."" She again says no and to talk to her supervisor and points. She says it's policy but then reluctantly walks over and let's me board as if she was doing me a favor.  Apparently policy didn't matter then and I wish the ordeal stopped there. When I get on the plane all of the bins are closed so I ask where can I put my bag. As far as I am concerned it could have been checked. The flight attendant gives me a bewildered how do I know look and ask what seat I'm in. It really didnt matter when I'm one of the last people on the plane and all bins are closed.  I go to my seat and open multiple bins only for her to to walk back and open one bin that has room and wasn't by my seat.",-1
2019-02-06,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Ft Lauderdale,,,,,,,1,outrageous practices they employ,True,  Houston to Ft Lauderdale. I booked a flight for myself and my wife 3 months out. I Upgraded to first class for an additional 400 dollars each ticket. I called back a week later to change my flight because our accommodations cancelled. They claimed that prices had changed and wanted to refund me $128.00 per ticket to go back to economy class instead of crediting me the S400 I paid per ticket. They also said that if i wanted to change the dates there would be a $200 dollar per ticket change fee plus an additional $200 dollars per ticket to get the same first class tickets one week later. This airline should be investigated for the outrageous practices they employ!,-1

Cabin Crew were extremely unprofessional, they dropped a couple of items from my dinner tray as well as cutlery. Discourteous and non considerate at all. They didn’t apologise and left me picking the items up. As well as this they locked the dimmable windows from when I boarded the plane and after multiple requests from myself and others they finally unlocked the windows so people could look out. It seemed as if they didn’t know how to use the equipment and the Cabin Crews Customer Service was horrendous.",-1

Before our flight we read mostly bad reviews about United. We did not know what to expect but were much surprised when great staff, food, quality and service were offered to us.

Then we needed to be at the airport at 7am for boarding.

2019-02-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Chicago via Springfield,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,never fly with United again,True,"  Milwaukee to Chicago via Springfield. Absolutely ridiculous. Flew out on Sunday from Springfield to Milwaukee with connecting flight in Chicago. Springfield was okay got right on and departed on time. Landed in Chicago, turned on my cell reception to immediately get a text stating my flight had been cancelled due to it needing repairs and to re book the next flight. No other flight we're available that day and I had to be where I was going by 8am the next day. So I was forced to take a bus to the Milwaukee airport. United could've provided a voucher or something instead of me having to come out of pocket to take that bus. Fast forward 6 days to the following Saturday. Trying to get back home leaving Milwaukee was no big deal. Landed I. Chicago and waited my 2 hour layover just to be announced over and over and over flight delayed due to plane needing repairs. This went on for about 4 hours. They wound up switching all of us to another plane. Finally get boarded and boom. Have to sit on the plane for almost an hour for them to repair a marker light on this plane. Not any compensation was offered for any inconveniences. Not even a complimentary adult beverage in flight. I'll never fly with United again. I'll stick to American. Their planes are newer and better maintained.",-1

I travelled for the first time with a new born and a toddler and I was amazed by the help and support of the staff in Rochester MN airport and PHX airport. They were very friendly and supportive even helped us pushing the stroller and carry one of our bags. In terms of seats they were flexible and helped us as a family be comfortable. A family friendly airline.,1
2019-02-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Rampa,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,1,Thanks for nothing United,True,  I booked this ticket exactly a week ago. The app told me it was a 92% that the plane is on time. So of course I get to Houston just to find out the plane is late due to maintenance. I purposely chose this flight because it landed at 3 and i worked at 5. But now my flight does not arrive in TPA until 4. So now I do not have a ride and the Uber home is 45$. I have already paid 354.82$ with no carry on just so I could get out of the airport quickly. The ladies at the desk in Houston were so rude asking me why I am questioning them and they do not provide ground transportation. I contacted customer service only for her to tell me file the claim and they will get back to me in 7 days. After this I went to the customer service desk located in section C in the Houston airport. The gentleman there was the kindest and reassured me I would get reimbursed for something because it’s a plane issue which means it’s United fault but I cannot handle the situation until I get to Tampa. So now my options are a 45$ Uber or I have no way of getting home. As I walk the hallways I see signs saying United #1 in on time departures and then I get to the website and see there are so many complaints about flight delays and not because of weather. Save your sanity do not fly United. Thanks for nothing United.,-1

Checked in for my flight home this morning and paid $30 to check my bag. Arrange new flight home, baggage fee does not transfer. So in essence,  $120 to check one bag. Never again with United! Not sure what is so complex about transferring that payment over to a new flight. Agent kept telling me I'll be getting a refund, that doesn't help me now in getting my bag home.",-1
2019-01-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Rapid City via Denver,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,staff was rude and uncaring,True,"  Philadelphia to Rapid City via Denver. We took only a carry on, no checked luggage to avoid unnecessary delays at the airport. Upon boarding the aircraft they took our carry-on as they said the overhead compartments were full. Once the aircraft was fully boarded, we were told there is a delay while they service the front strut on the plane. During the flight the WiFi didn't work. We arrived in Denver late and had to run through the airport to catch our next flight to Rapid City. We were to late to board, but they said it doesn't matter as the flight was going to be canceled for bad weather. When the flight was canceled we decided to drive to Rapid City, we requested our carry-on luggage which we should of had with us if but United took it from us. It took United Airlines 3 hours and 15 minutes to get the luggage from the canceled flight to the claim area. The staff was rude and uncaring, they said it can take up to 4 hours. Not 1 United employee apologized in any way for the canceled flight or the delay in retrieving our luggage. We paid $328.80 per ticket and United Airlines gave us a measly $101.94 back as a refund, for a flight they never provided. United Airlines service is terrible and they will rip you off! All appeals just fell on deaf ears.. F- The only thing they got right is we landed safely in Denver Colorado, half way to our destination.",-1

My flight got cancelled due to weather which wasn’t so bad. Definitely understandable. But where I am annoyed is that they automatically transferred the flight to a flight to Houston. I specifically asked the bag check to not put my bag on that flight seeing as though I decided to stay another night and try a flight the next day - but they went ahead and sent my luggage to Houston anyways. And said they couldn’t send it back, that it would be sent to Chicago. So I’m stranded here with none of my things, I’m pregnant, and this is just flat out unacceptable. I will never fly United again. Also, tried calling someone to talk but was on hold for over 45 minutes so I have to resort to this. And lastly your planes are so uncomfortable, a measly 1hr and 45min plane ride was dreadful. My flight on the way to New Orleans was also delayed 3 hours! How can you operate and treat your customers like this?",-1
2019-01-29,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tampa,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,5.0,4,level of professionalism was unusual,True,"  Chicago to Tampa. Weather can be a significant challenge when flying. We arrived early for our 5.50 pm flight out of O'Hare to Tampa, and saw a 2.25 pm flight traveling the same route. We checked with a desk agent as to whether getting on that flight might be an option, and she kindly did a quick check to see if there were any seats. She told us we might have a good chance to get on but we needed to hurry to the gate where the flight was scheduled to load. It was quite a hike but we made it to the 2.25 pm flight gate. The first staff member we met seemed confused about our request, but we had received an email from United indicating that fees were not being charged to change flights due to weather so he eventually put us on Stand-By. While he was working on the Stand-By tickets, we struck up a conversation with the supervisor of the desk - and that's what impressed us. She was very cordial and gracious. She kindly asked us to give her a few minutes to see what she could work out and in a couple of minutes she called us up and had two tickets, and noted she was able to find two seats together for us on the flight. Her level of professionalism was unusual. The change of flights went well. The flight was fine.",1
2019-01-29,0.5,Business,Economy Class,Tokyo to Denver,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,3,hard to get comfortable,True," Early evening departure from Narita on Dreamliner (B787-800). Upgraded 2 days before to Economy plus seats. Boarding was efficient, and we departed on time. Economy plus seats gave additional legroom, and this was much appreciated. The 3-3-3 configuration is a little cramped width-wise, you just have to hope that your fellow passengers are on the petite size. Seats were equipped with headrests, but no foot-rests. Blankets and pillow provided, and earphones. IFE was pretty good - sharp, touch screen, reasonable selection of movies and TV shows and even an eclectic relaxation channel. Downside was audio - no selectable tracks, just a series of themed audio tracks which meant you just have to leave it on and wait for songs to appear. Food choices ranged from tolerable to OK, basically it's calories to sustain you. Crew ranged from relatively indifferent to briskly efficient. The Dreamliner made it a little more tolerable, with reduced noise levels even in economy. The biggest downside was that despite the adequate legroom, I found it really hard to get comfortable in the chairs - I can't explain it. Perhaps a combination of thin padding and/or compressed width? At the end, it was a flight to be endured rather than enjoyed, but perhaps that is a good outcome for a United flight.",-1
2019-01-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Richmond via Denver,1.0,,5.0,5.0,,4.0,1,I am very upset,True,  My flight from Vegas was delayed due to the weather conditions in Denver according to the pilot. Okay I was fine with that because If the weather is bad for arriving planes then it would be bad for departing planes as well I thought logically. Was delayed an hour because I got to Denver at 9:44am instead of 8:52am but when I got here my connecting flight had left. Leaving me to wait in the airport until 5:20pm and getting home at 12am. I am very upset because I wanted to change my flight to leave on the 27th but couldn’t and now I’m stuck not to mention the reason for the delay was incorrect so that United has no liability because it was not due to medical reason. You have my money and now satisfaction isn’t important unless I pay more. Never will I chose United again better off flying with Spirit at least you can expect certain service for the price.,-1
2019-01-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Buffalo via Chicago,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,forced to check a carry on,True,"  San Francisco to Buffalo via Chicago. First- I was charged $30 and forced to check a carry on. You can only bring a small bag that fits under your seat- backpack type size. People that were boarding with say a purse and a shoulder bag were spoken to rudely about it and forced to put purse inside bag in front of a camera? Ticket taker said to next guy who had one small bag “I see you read the memo.” And they laughed. So demeaning and unnecessary. This was boarding in San Francisco 35 minutes late btw. People were going to miss connecting flights - but the women with a purse that clearly would fit in her other bag were the important issue. I get to Chicago, find my gate- Grateful I only have 40 minutes to sit. About 15 minutes before scheduled boarding the attendant informs us there is a 2 hour delay due to the fact that the plane is not functioning or something like that. Not sure he could have shown less interest. I know - don’t shoot the messenger- but this was 7:15 am, I’m sure everyone had been traveling as I had, and now needed to find some awful airport food to get through the new timeline. We all carefully choose flights to minimize this wasted time.  I don’t think people really care until they are affected. The flight from SFO was full. United will continue to do this.",-1
2019-01-27,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Buffalo to London via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2,status continues to fade in value,False,  I made a horrible rookie mistake. Thinking that a Boeing 787 would have the appropriate number if business class seats vs economy. Bad move on my part. Back of the bus with plenty of seats. Business class has only 36 total. My $2000 refundable one way ticket with a Global upgrade and 100K status for 16 years with 2.7 million miles flown doesn't even get me close to the top of the upgrade list. Hugely disappointing and United status continues to fade in value as has been happening since the Continental merger. Once I hit my 3 million miles lifetime for 100K status lifetime I'll be switching to Delta.,-1

This return was so much better compared to our outgoing flight. This time the crew we dealt with were smiling, friendly and attentive. They served a meal which was quite good actually, them came by twice more during this 4.5 hour flight offering cookies and snacks. All in all they acted very professionally and we appreciated that. Its unfortunate that other UAL flight crews behave so differently IME like anything goes. I certainly hope UAL is listening and will realize that the interactions by their personnel overall represents the face of their product to the consumer and will emphasize that their crew make passengers feel valued, welcomed and wanted.

2019-01-23,0.1,Business,Business Class,Dulles to Paris,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,the very worst for both of us,False,"  Purchased business tickets for my wife for 1/21 and myself to travel on 1/19 from Richmond to Paris. The first United Airlines flight from Richmond to Dulles was 2 hours late thus I missed my Paris flight. My wife’s flight was 1.5 hours late and she missed hers. The United gate agents in Richmond, with the exception of 1,  were untrained, ineffective and mostly ignorant. My wife’s agent forgot to switch her luggage when she was rerouted through Germany. At age 67 , I have travelled on business and pleasure most of my life, but these 2 experiences rank as the very worst for both of us.",-1
2019-01-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Houston,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no communication from pilot,False,  I flew with United Airlines Dec 26 from Toronto to Houston. We encountered weather problems or turbulence by Houston Airport or that was what I assumed. We circled the airport in the fog for 40 minutes with no communication from pilot or staff the entire time to let us know what was going on. Was an unnerving experience. On Jan 16 I again flew with United Airlines from Auckland to San Francisco. Again no communication from pilot or staff regarding the reason for the excessive turbulence. The stewardesses seemed to be very irritable and also the washrooms very dirty. The only thing said by the pilot was thanks for flying United after we landed.  Will not recommend this airline for any future trips for anyone,-1

I had a flight scheduled for 5:45pm on Jan. 21st, and 1 hour before the flight they decided to cancel it. I had work the next day. And of course, nothing was compensated. No hotel stay, no food, because it was weather related. I had to sleep in the terminal. I despise this sort of treatment. I will forever avoid United.",-1
2019-01-22,0.3,Couple Leisure,First Class,Chicago to Punta Cana,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,2,this one was appalling,True,"  We flew 1st class from ORD-PUJ in the Dominican Republic. I must say the flight back was good and that will be posted in a different review but this one was appalling. We were in the first row and had a birds eye view of the flight attendant having what I will call a bad hair day. She put her long, stringy hair in bun, let it down and put it up again and so on a few times. That wasn't so bad but at least twice she ran her fingers through her hair and dropped dislodged hairs and goodness only know what else directly onto the cabin floor! I can't believe it but she did. I never saw her wash her hands and yes she served meals too. The breakfast was supposed to be eggs Benedict. Well there was no poached egg, it resembled a scrambled mishmash and the Hollandaise sauce was baked into the egg instead of being a sauce. So in sum the food was poor and the sanitary practices simply failed due to negligence.",-1
2019-01-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Worst plane ride ever,True," Cincinnati to Chicago. Worst plane ride ever and that says a lot considering it was also the shortest. Extremely small and uncomfortable plane. After telling me my carry-on bag was fine, they decided it was too big, as well as many other people, and made us leave our bags outside the plane without telling us where to get them. After the ride was over I had to search for someone to ask, where they made us all line up in the cold and wait for them. They may have actually told us, but whoever gave the instructions spoke such a poor excuse for English it was pathetic, and I really don't mind accents normally, as long as I can understand. They can't do the job if nobody can understand them and they just keep yelling and gesturing and even grabbing at my belongings because they can't compose a sentence to tell me what to do with them. I was also supposed to be in a row by myself, but out of nowhere the flight crew pulls out a seat behind the wall and blocks me in the aisle and completely blocks off the bathroom so nobody could use it and making one long row with no space in it. I would never willingly book with this airline.",-1

Was charged $30 per carry on bag, had to check our 2 bags, as they wouldn't allow us to carry on proper size bags cuz we booked economy. When we complained was told we should of done it at the airport which was crazy as they were backed up so bad and had no time. It's a trap! Just don't fly United, I know we won't ever again!",-1
2019-01-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madison to Newark via Chicago,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,being lied to and neglected,True,"  Madison to Newark via Chicago. This morning, I arrived at the airport and waited in line to check my bag for 25 minutes. Once I finally got up to the counter the agent at my desk disappeared for another 15 minutes. She finally came back but said I would miss my flight because I was a few minutes late from the checked baggage cutoff time. The agent tried rebooking my ticket for me. I’m not sure if she was new or wasn’t trained on the system well enough because it took her a long time to rebook the ticket to the point where her supervisor had to jump in. Her supervisor told her to push me to the side and said that they would “deal with me later”. I waited another 20 minutes for them to get through the rest of the line. Once I finally got my ticket rebooked, the flight is not only not a direct flight, it’s also supposed to reach my destination 8 hours after my initial flight. First of all, I shouldn’t have had been put on hold just because there’s a long line to get through. Secondly, right before I was pushed to the side, the agent promised to put me on the next possible flight at 11 am. But after being pushed aside, I got put on the 1:50 pm flight. The inconsistency and empty promising is so unacceptable. I am being lied to and neglected by your staff. I have never experienced this with other airlines. Delta next door had the same amount of people in line and they got through the line 30 minutes faster than United. Delta in the past had allowed me to board my airplane still while my baggage goes on the next flight but United would not allow me to do that. I have lost 8 hours of my time to spend with my parents whom I have not seen in 2 years due to the your staff’s incapability to work efficiently. How could you possibly ever replace this valuable time I lost because of your inconsiderate employees. Thanks to United, I will now have 5 hours to cry at the airport. This experience is making me reconsider ever taking a United flight again. Especially seeing that comparison of service quality side by side with Delta.",-1

2019-01-17,0.6,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Newark via Houston,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,3,they were fine,True,"  Sydney to Newark via Houston. I was happy to book and fly with them because they use the Boeing 787 aircraft on the 14 hour flight to Houston. As an airline, they weren’t amazing, but they were fine. The food was fine, nothing to write home about, and the entertainment was okay, a few too many ‘old’ movies for my liking. The flight attendants were old and a bit abrupt, not overly friendly but not rude. I did notice the seats did not recline back very far, which was not ideal on a flight you have to sleep on. Luckily the middle seat in our row was free so we could spread out a little. Both flights left on time. Would I fly United again? It wouldn’t be my first choice, but I wouldn’t rule it out.",1
2019-01-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They are terrible!,True,"  San Diego to Honolulu. They are terrible! I never leave reviews on anything unless I feel strongly about what I’m reviewing and this is one of those times. Starting out I could tell the day was not going to go well, me and my boyfriend flew from San Diego to Honolulu, with a layover in Los Angeles. The first flight wasn’t bad. it was a small plane and there were no amenities; no WiFi, no complementary drinks or snacks, or anything else. However the flight was less than an hour so I wasn’t expecting much and it was okay. The second flight however was a complete nightmare! We were in the very last row of the plane which may have contributed to our horrible experience but so many other things happened as well. This was a 5 and a half hour flight and there was no WiFi, they had “in flight demand movies” which you needed to watch, so that didn’t work. Also for the first 3 and a half hours of the flight, there was no drink or snack service, at all. The only people who got served were first class. Which I get. Those passengers pay extra for that sort of thing, but other airlines would have served us twice by now. The flight attendants werent worried about the passengers, The flight attendants were all in the back of the plane making fun of passengers, gossiping, etc all of which I can hear since I’m right in front of them. Eventually, I think they received a hint when a few passengers started walking towards the back of the plane and asking them for water, and drinks. Then a line started forming down the aisle of the plane of passengers walking to the back to where all 4 flight attendants were standing. The flight attendants seemed annoyed and irritated that no one was staying seating and the aisle was being blocked, so finally almost 4 hours into the flight the first cart of drinks and snacks was wheeled down and they started serving people. By this time, all the passengers were cranky and irritated by the rude staff and how we were all being treated. The attendants were rolling eyes and huffing and puffing and it was just an all around terrible experience. Not to mention when we were leaving the flight attendants were mocking us on how slow we were and how it doesn’t take that long to get off the plane. There were 86 rows of 3 on this flight, it’s gonna take a minute for everyone to get off. This was just the perfect example of how people who have money got treated immensely better than those in economy. I feel sorry for anyone who was a passenger on this flight! If I could give this a zero I would. This was my first time flying United and it will most certainly be my last.",-1

Do you have no back up pilots? Your people told us our next flight would be at the same time the next day. Then you change it to 11:00pm the day after next. Then, to top it all off, they send a bus to pick us up from the hotel at 7 and we arrive at the airport at 8 and none of the lines are open? Its about to be 2 hours before the flight leaves. I am never flying United again, so beyond frustrated.",-1

From 12th of January when I suppose to go back home I came back today 2 pm and today is 14th. The worst experience what I had. First flight was delayed weather condition in Chicago where is my connection flight for Vegas - so obviously I will not make it. I cooperate and changing flight for 13th via Washington. I am came in the morning United app didn’t notify me that flight is canceled!,I need to wait 8h for next one. Then that one I delayed. They change me then to American Airlines convincing me that I will make it like that. Then that flight was late 30 minutes and then I didn’t make it again on my connection!!! So now it’s already 9 pm, next flight is in the morning on 14th of January from Philadelphia and United phone agent is telling me that they don’t know if they can provide me a hotel! Luckily nice woman name who is working there on United gates in Philadelphia helped me that I can have where to sleep that night. She is the only normal person with whom I spoke from United. I forgot to say when I wanted to complain and I did complain to manager of United in Harrisburg she answered me: well you chose by yourself to fly with United.  That is not cool. Was so so frustrated and angry.",-1
2019-01-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Colorado Springs,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,Would not recommend,False,  Houston to Colorado Springs. Flight was delayed due to an issue with the emergency brake. It took 30 minutes to figure this out before they made everyone get off the plane. Said it would be up to an hour delay. Eventually they switched planes. After 1.5 hours we boarded the new plane. We sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before taking off. Terrible experience with United Airlines. Would not recommend flying with them.,-1

2019-01-13,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Honolulu to Los Angeles,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,3,needs more check in assistance,False,  Honolulu to Los Angeles. United Airlines needs more check in assistance at HNL. I stood at a self check in screen for 30 minutes waiting for assistance. At this point I couldn't check my bags. The first assistant to help me forgot about me. Another 20 minutes pass and I have missed my flight and they had to book me on an American Airlines flight. In summary they cut costs on man power and it costs them man hours and customer satisfaction in the end.,-1

I will never fly again with United. I booked four flights and needed to change one of the passengers names. My husband was originally going but because of work he could not so I wanted to change the passenger to my son. They would not under any circumstances allow me to do so. It is apparent this airline cares nothing about their customers!,-1

This was my first experience flying the highly touted Polaris product, and quite frankly, it is a vast improvement over the 8 across business class that we have been putting up with on this route for so long. Perhaps the crew was as pleased as the passengers to be in this re-configured and upgraded business section. Service was impeccable, lots of smiles, lots of personalization. Indeed, this experience was one of the best I have had on United. The meals were excellent, properly served and delicious. Entertainment was excellent. Lavatories were clean and comfortable. All in all, an excellent experience. Hence the 10 rating.",1

From the beginning of our flight you can see how rude are the people that are working for United. Nobody helps us on the checking our bags. I was with my wife and our doughter 13 years old and when we ask that our seats on flight UA 934 were not on the same row they sad in a really very rude way - you have to ask at EWR airport. After arriving there we ask again and they try but the couldn’t do anything! So, when we were on the plane, we ask our self other people if we can change seats. We notice that there were more people like us! Chaos! They took also all our small bags from LAX and they told us that you will get them in Athens! Finally we arrived with 3 from our bags broken! Dear United, you should learn service to your passengers from much smaller airline Aegean Airline or bigger one Lufthansa!",-1

I have flown with many airlines in my life and this is by far the worst. They have continued their unbundling strategy for pricing. What this includes is removing carry-ons from the standard rate. This allows them to show a lower price 98% of people don't use because they're not going to walk-on role playing with just the shirt on their back. They have also used an algorithm to determine the most popular seats which aren't really any better than any other seats in economy but you have to pay extra for those. Top it off the service of the what is a Time counter recently especially terrible. Disinterested and rude, will not enjoy your flight.",-1

I started using it about a year prior until i tried other airlines like Southwest, jetblue or Delta. Always delayed, rude staff and overpriced. You cannot cancel your ticket 24 hours after you book.

This airline charges $30 for bags checked, individually. I agree, but do not agree with charging for backpacks. The purpose of charging for bags was to get the TSA to screen faster, so sometimes people pack a lot of stuff and bring huge luggage that is ridiculous. Now if we want to check in a small backpack because we have 5 oz bottles of sauce from the country we visited, that does not make sense. At that point the airline is charging for profit and not thinking about its customer's needs nor about the origin of this screening rule, 9-11. The airline is taking profit from a tragedy we all endured and not thinking logically! For my family there is no more flying United. Our choices have power.",-1

I was flying home with a small bag and encounter fees that we were unaware of that cost 65 dollars. The lady was extremely rude and the above compartments were completely empty. This carrier has always been extremely difficult. Every other carrier American, Delta, Southwest are very accomodating and if you are looking to fly I would recommend using one of them.

We encountered baggage fees we were unaware of. When we checked in they made us check all baggage. I think we were the only ones on the plane not allowed carry-ons.

I booked a United flight for 12 January one way for $247 dollars three days ago. Upon checking my bank account it has occurred to me that United is holding $347 which is a $100 more than what I paid. When I called customer service to get the matter resolved they were no help. I talked to both a regular employee and the manager. Both admitted to a system error charging my account to much money and lied about when the funds would be back  available in my account. It has now been well over 48 hours since I booked the flight and this airline is still holding this extra money.,-1

After this experience with United, they will not be my first choice any more. The flight had mechanical issues (which are understandable) but the service (by that I mean, attitude rudeness, and lack of information, or help) that we received from the employees at the gate was absolutely inconceivable and unnecessary. They were rude, absolutely unhelpful. And did nothing to help us during the 6+ hour delay. When I complained to United Customer service via their website after the flight, they were equally unapologetic and unhelpful. This has really soured my opinion of this airline and I will go out of my way in the future to avoid flying with them.",-1

On the first leg of my trip they somehow screwed up on seating assignments - the result was 30 minutes of musical chairs before take off. Beverage service took forever. They require payment for in flight entertainment ($8 to watch Direct TV?! Ridiculous) and don't have charging ability for devices beyond row 21. The ""remote "" for the tv is located on the armrest, which means keeping one's arms tucked uncomfortably within the seat so as to not change the channel on your neighbor's screen. Wherever possible I will avoid United like the plague.",-1

United Airlines isn’t my go to airline but sometimes I have to take it due to lack of alternatives. Whenever I do take it, I get reminded why I dislike taking it. In flight customer service has never impressed me. Flight attendants are unfriendly and unwilling to help. I got stuck with my small luggage because of lack of space in the business class. The flight attendant directed me to go to the back of the flight to find a spot when I was sitting upfront. This not only resulted a long delay for everyone but took me 15 minutes to get back to the front and just to find out I could’ve fit my bag in the overhead near my seat. Zero initiative to provide any help. Let me add laziness too to my description.",-1

It was outrageous they didn't give me a refund prior to flying out they instead promised me a seat that wasn't empty I was furious. The airline messed up on my order and still had the nerve to upgrade someone's seat instead save your money and book elsewhere United Airlines treat their customers like a joke. The staff on board were attentive but the leg room seemed to be smaller than other aircraft. In addition, the food was dry and mediocre it was hard to swallow.

These people are the most rude and selfish people I have ever dealt with. I am in the Canadian military and specifically asked before booking my flight whether we were covered for checked baggage. I was told that I am and so I booked with them. Now being at the airport they tell me they only cover for US and refuse to do anything to help me out. They were condescending, rude, and refused to help out with anything wanting me to pay over $300USD for my 3 bags. Eventually rebooked to Air Canada and I would recommend Air Canada to anyone.",-1

United recently impressed me when I was promised a travel voucher and to be able to change flights by reservation agent. I confirmed the details multiple times. I asked if I would have to go to the gate and through security and he said no. The agent also said the voucher and changing flight was guaranteed and it was rare to be offered this. I showed up to the airport today with no bags (because I was guaranteed a voucher and to switch flights). Then I realized I was lied to. Lady at the ticketing counter in Syracuse was very helpful, but said that I was misinformed. I ended up spending over 2 hours between the ticketing counter and calling reservations today. I received a later flight but no voucher. I feel deceived and absolutely disrespected. There’s such a lack in their customer service experience and overall respect for people’s time, which is now something I can’t get back. I have now wasted non refundable minutes dealing with something I was promised multiple times. I will not be using United as my airline of choice and highly advise against using them.",-1

They retarded our flight from Houston to San Jose Costa Rica and they were trying to let us think it was because of the weather, but all other airline managed to make their flight that day. They canceled our flight because they were missing staff, but still they were saying it was weather. The flight was schedule for 9:15am on the next morning, but they still didn't had staff. They finally made the flight passes 11:00am. That flight was schedule originally the day before at 9:30pm. Furthermore, after cancelling my flight back before the 24hours allowed to cancel it they confirm that my flight was canceled, but did not refund it. I'm still trying to get the refund... Worst airline: United Airline",-1
2019-01-04,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Bogota,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2,Not recommended,True," We flew from Houston to Bogota in a night flight, so the first thing you would expect of a night flight is to have a comfortable pillow and a thick, nice blanket. That's the first mistake, no pillow and some cheap blanket that made no difference to the super cold AC. Well, we won't sleep, let's watch a movie or something with this nice DirecTV screen in front of us. Surprise! The screen won't let you open even the flight map  without swiping your card for 8 dollars.  I guess I will have to use the United App and watch something there, but I'm running out of battery. Surprise, only Business and Economy Plus rows have power outlets. United Airlines' staff are nice and caring but anyway those mistakes make me have a bitter experience with them. Not recommended.",-1

I brought a upgrade with miles , TPA to EWR on time with nice Fa `s and decent food. The Polaris Lounge in EWR is a huge hit.

I have never been so heartbroken in my life. I booked my flight months prior looking forward to a wonderful vacation reuniting with my family, then a couple weeks before my flight I get a call my grandmother is in the hospital and not doing well she has about 3 months to live, I figured okay I can still be there in a couple weeks to see her. Flash forward to a week before my flight, I get another call my grandmother is fading fast and is in comfort care (meaning end of life) and she wont last more than a few days. I  call the airline asking if there is any possible way I can get a sooner flight. And although the gentleman who was helping me through customer service was very kind and very sympathetic to my situation, trying everything he can do to help me, the manager denied me. I cannot believe how selfish this company is. They do not care about their customers they ONLY care about their money.",-1
2019-01-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Norfolk to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,stay far away,False, Norfolk to Houston. Booked through Orbitz. Paid $22 dollars per ticket for insurance. Don't do it! Even with the insurance United would not work with the agent to refund the ticket. Had to change due to Active Duty orders and still they would not work with me. I contacted Orbitz and got refunded my insurance on the tickets ($66) and they told me to call United directly to try and get a refund with orders. After being on hold for 25 minutes with United the rep told me she could not transfer me to the department refund and that I would need to talk to Orbitz again so that they could contact them. Requested to speak with supervisor and she had me submit a form online for my refund. Terrible customer service and the worst part is that I only needed to change my flights to an earlier time and cancel my return flight (not my families ticket) and they still would not work with me. Never will work with United again. I'm a rewards member with Delta and American and come to find out the extra $50 or $100 you are gonna pay is 100% worth it. If you are still reading stay far away!,-1
2019-01-03,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to San Francisco,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5,we couldn't have been happier,False,"  Our family of 5 (3 teenage boys) traveled with United to San Francisco from Sydney and then we returned with United to Sydney from Washington DC (changed planes in San Francisco). Flights to and from San Francisco were economy on the new Boeing 787 which were fabulous. Seats were roomy (one of my sons is 6' 3"") with good leg space. In-flight entertainment was great. We were particularly pleased with how smooth the flight was, little turbulence seemed to affect the plane. However it was the wonderful flight attendant staff which made all the difference. Attentive, polite, nothing was too much trouble.I am gluten free and had all my meals and snacks pre-ordered which didn't miss a beat. They genuinely seemed happy going about their work, chatting and laughing with my sons. Overall we couldn't have been happier. Only small complaint was the domestic flight from DC to San Francisco we had to pay for our in-flight entertainment on tiny little screens, $8US each (x5 for each family member) and no free snacks/meals provided on the 6 hr flight unlike Australian airlines, so be prepared with snacks.",1

United Airlines desperately need to upgrade these planes. We paid over $2000 USD for each seat on this flight, and the first class seats don’t even have tvs or usb ports. The seats are basically just wider seats than the normal seats. I have flown on Delta and American recently and both of those airlines are more updated with nice tvs, usbs, seats that fully lay flat and are way more comfortable. The flight attendants are nice, but I definitely do not recommend United Airlines.",-1
2019-01-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Port of Spain,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,very last flight on United,True," Newark to Port of Spain. If one’s wondering if customer service has died among the US carriers then any flight with United will confirm that sadly it is deep in the grave. If the insults of charging customers for every single small comfort ever conceived in private transport, weren’t already enough, the totally apathetic or even hostile attitude of the staff in anything but top tier business class, appears to demand that already deceased customers, rise just to be killed again. Passengers flying United are treated no better than cattle, or more properly cash cows to be milked, and then thrown off the plane. In both of our flights the only time the cabin crew even spoke to customers was to reprimand them or tontry and talk them into checking a bag. Heaven forbid they expend a calorie trying to welcome or make customers fee at home. The boarding process for our int’l flight was a keystone cops disaster which could have easily been avoided with simple crowd management measures. Instead they stuffed an entire four groups into two narrow lines - even though they had four and expected people to trample over each other. The solo cranky ticket taker was snapping at customers telling them to “go here, “ then no, there!” while a security person randomly deleted bags - by eye to get tagged and taken from customers as they entered the plane - no advisory, explanation, apology, nothing. Not a manager was to be seen during all this and our departure was over an hour late. Horrible experience from start to finish. That will be our very last flight on United ever.",-1
2019-01-03,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Halifax to Newark,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,blown away by the service,True," Today I took a flight from Halifax to Nerwark (Flight UA4149) and I was absolutely blown away by the service given by the flight attendant. This lady went above and beyond for not just me but every person on the flight, I was suffering from terrible sore throat and cold and felt terrible. She went to her own purse and gave me throat lozenges, and got me a cup of ice to soothe my throat purely out of the kindness of her heart and without me even having to ask and she also checked on me. I gave this woman a hug before I left the aircraft, she was caring and very witty she had us all laughing.",1
2019-01-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Missoula to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Zero business ethics,True,  Their online booking is misleading (out and out tells you one thing but you end up with another). The staff is rude and “just do not care”. Whatever happened to the days when people were just nice to each other just because one can be? What happened to businesses that cared about their clients? Well some still exist - but it isn’t United airlines. They have extremely rude staff every single time I’ve flown with them. Lost my luggage out of Cancun but didn’t help me in the least to hook in with the insurance I bought. So stressful I just ate it and went on with life. This is literally the worst company on the planet to date for me to review. Zero business ethics. Zero customer care ethics. Investing in anything to do with United is out of the question. Flying with them - not if my life depended on it.,-1
2019-01-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Portland,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never fly with United again,True,"  Houston to Portland. Our flight was delayed for an hour, which is not a lot and I understand that delays happen so that was reasonable. When I was up at the counter asking the attendants a question, instead of looking at me, she was looking at her phone ignoring what I was saying and just nodding her head. I am traveling with a family of 6, and we just got the economy boarding. When flying from Portland to Houston, we were ok with the size of our personal item which was a few inches off of the “sample” so we figured it would be the same scenario on our way back. (Taking into consideration that we weren’t allowed a carry on, despite a lot of space available in the cabins which we saw once we got on the plane.) When we began boarding our attendant was very rude and asked us why we were taking our personal item when we “weren’t allowed anything on the plane” I proceeded to tell her that we got the “ok” from the front check-in as well as when we flew from Portland to Houston. Again, she was rude and said we had to pay in order to have our items on the plane and if not that we could just stay here. She was like “tell me know are you going or are you staying.” I decided to then pay, thinking that it would be the same amount as our checked bags, but no, it was $180 for two personal item bags. $180 + a rude attendant. But of course, we have no choice, who would want to leave their things behind? After paying and waking to board the plane, she proceeded to follow us and tell us to hurry up basically chasing us down the hall. When we got to the door there was a serviceman fixing something so we couldn’t actually step in; yet she was telling us to hurry. I’ve heard a lot of bad reviews about United Airlines, but I never thought it would personally happen to me. I will never fly with United again. Not only because of the outrageous amount for two personal items, but because of the rude service more than anything.",-1

We had a 24 hour layover due to weather and not even a free hotel to stay in because apparently “they don’t cover that.” I’m sitting at our gate right now in which I was supposed to leave yesterday. There’s not one staff member and the plane was supposed to leave at 7:15 but could not because the captain was a no show. Please help yourself arrive to your destination easier and travel delta.

One of the worst Airlines i have ever travelled with. Staff is rude, food is below quality. For international flight of more than 15 hours they dont serve you spirits as well.

The United employees this morning were so rude, I was honestly taken aback. I had a question about where to go as I had a problem entering my passport information online. The employee I asked just repeatedly told me it was not her section so she couldn’t help me. When I did figure out where to go, I entered my info into the kiosk but needed an employee to verify it. She patronized me and treated me like a moron for not being able to scan my passport. I never fly United and will try not to again. This experience made me realize how politely I’ve always been treated by Southwest, and now I won’t take that for granted. United employees must be pretty unhappy. Their customer service is non-existent.",-1

The lady next to me misses her flight. The gentleman working C8 gates at 21:26 in O'Hare shrugs his shoulders and says go to customer service. No emotion, no apology. Was more interested in flirting with another passenger. I also bought a direct flight in March of 2018 for a direct flight to NYC from Fort Wayne. I never received my vouchers and trying to call to inquire about them is more difficult then walking through the Grand Canyon. Might be the cheapest airlines but step it up United.",-1

2018-12-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Portland,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst flight in my entire life,True,"  San Francisco to Portland. This was the worst flight in my entire life and I am 62 years old. I will NEVER fly United Airlines again. We started boarding on time and were about 1/2 full when they asked us to deplane for a maintenance issue. At first, we weren't told when they thought we might take iff. Then every 1/2 hr they would say it would be another 1/2 hr before we knew anything. I learned more about the problem in United's texts than from their Customer Service personnel. We finally were told it was ONE indicator light that wasn't working. After 2 1/2 hours they told people about another possible flight leaving at 7 pm. The problem with that was it was completely FULL & had people on standby. So you could give up a PAID RESERVATION for a seat on another flight with the slight possibility of getting on. This made no sense. They finally brought out free water and snacks but never bothered announcing this so by the time I'd heard about it they were all gone. They then changed our gate to a less comfortable location with fewer seats. People were seating on the floor. I've got health issues and this entire experience was awful . I usually fly with Southwest and I've never encountered anything like this. I understand that it is the holidays but United should have been better prepared for situations such as this. Think twice before flying United.",-1

Placed me in a complete opposite of the plane from my wife even though I selected my seats!

Never again, and I’m not a picky traveller. Redirected due to weather/not enough gas. Airplane late, missed my flight to Guadalajara. United could not book me on the next two flights to where they were supposed to, so booked me to a different city the next day. I’m fine paying a bit to stay overnight, but now I’ll be in a different city and have to figure out a way to get to my final destination. Double accommodation and double the bus booked now and paid, and UA doesn’t even want to help by offering to pay anything, yet alone a taxi. UA we understand weather can’t be controlled, but if you can’t get me to my destination, shouldn’t that be compensated? I got a meal voucher though (laughs out loud, 24h limit). It’s 11pm and I’m tired, exhausted and fed up spending extra money, I’m not hungry and a meal voucher doesn’t cut it. I will never fly this airline again, as my travels may be ruined this time.",-1
2018-12-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Denver,2.0,,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,even Spirit wasn’t this bad,True,"  I had a round trip flight from Denver to Philly and back for the holidays. The trip to Philly wasn’t too bad other than a weather delay (not the airlines fault at all) and the rude flight attendant. However, upon checking into my returning flight I received an error that I didn’t exists as a passenger. I called the number provided and was informed that because I missed the train connecting me to Philly after my first flight (which I missed because of to the delayed flight) my return ticket was voided and I was no longer on the flight! I received no notification of this, not a text, email. And was not reimbursed at all. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with their Customer Service who then informed I would need to pay an additional $411 to have my ticket reinstated.(I had already paid 600 for this round trip) I’d rather hitch hike 1600 miles with strangers than fly United again. Happy holidays to me, right? I ended up having to spend another $525 I didn't have to get flight back with a different airline. I fly a decent amount having family and work locations all over the country, I strayed away from usual airline to save $100 bucks on this trip and it ended up costing me an extra $550 after all things in included.

2018-12-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Tel Aviv,,,,,,1.0,1,The worst experience,True,"  Newark to Tel Aviv. The worst experience of my lifetime! I was supposed to fly on 12/25/18 for a very short trip for a family reunion and my daughter's celebrations. My flight was cancelled when I arrived to airport (less than 3 hours before the flight) and the cancellation text message came from Expedia, not United! United did not even bother to let me know in advance so that I would not go to the airport for nothing! I hold the driver who brought us to the airport for a while to figure out what happened. At the entrance I was told by a United rep that the flight is still on, just the aircraft was replaced so I have to check-in again (I did online check-in the day before). So I let the driver go and was waiting in the line until I reached the check-in desk where I was told that the flight is cancelled and there are no seats on the replacement flight. Nobody apologized. None of the agents looked a tiny bit sorry about what happened and nobody rushed to help resolve the situation. It felt like a 3rd hand company in a developing country, not the biggest American airline. After lots of efforts I got a replacement flight a day after and with a several hours stop in Europe. I was not offered any compensation for the damage they caused to us as all our Israeli plans had to change. After spending quite a bit of time trying to find a way to submit a complaint I finally did it and received an automated message offering $200 e-ticket or bonus miles. I do not need any of them as I will do my best to never fly United again! What a horrible Christmas experience.",-1

2018-12-27,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Mumbai,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,the worst customer service,True,"  Newark to Mumbai. United airlines had the worst customer service on the ground. I flew on Christmas. But even accounting for the holiday rush, their services were just unbelievably bad! To begin with, they had a common check-in for ALL flights. To add to the chaos, everybody was supposed to check-in at the kiosk and there was absolutely nobody to help in case somebody got stuck. At one point 5 out of 6 kiosks were unable to complete the check-in, stranding people behind. There was a separate queue for travel assistance, which had about 20-30 people waiting and only 1 counter  was available for assistance. It took us about 1 hour 45 min to complete the check in and reach the security. On another note, I was traveling with my boyfriend and we wanted our seats together. We had selected the seats immediately after booking our tickets. The seats got reshuffled three times due to ""a change in the plane"" and ""the system"" reshuffled the seats such that our seats got separated. United surely needs to fix their ""system"" that is unable to do a simple one-to-one mapping and is somehow adding a random factor on its own. I hope United fixes these issues soon.",-1
2018-12-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Amsterdam,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,United is worthless,False,  We paid $350 for my 12 year old to fly from Houston to Amsterdam with their unaccompanied minor program. The united attendant did not pay attention while they were in the baggAGe area and my son picked up an identical suitcase. I spent hours on our vacation trying to get the suitcase back to the true owners. They even had all their Christmas presents in there. Could never find anyone at United to escalate to. Had to buy overpriced clothes for my son. United is worthless. If they weren’t watching the baggage pick up - what else were they not watching.,-1

First since we booked through Air Canada and rerouted to United they refused us access in the lounge at the airport. There were six other first class guests who had the same issue as us on the flight. The 737 was old and did not have TVs, it was suggested we could download the United app since it would allow us access to Internet. Problem was it would not be accessible for about two hours of the trip. We were told United was removing all unnecessary weight from planes to allow for more seating and storage. Since just about everyone now days travels with a mobile device it was not something they felt clients needed. First of all we do not pay all that extra to fly in a stripped Dow situation. It is bad enough they have reduced the number of washrooms and the one at the front is in constant us from people in economy. The aisles are filled with people and the staff precariously avoiding them will trying to serve. What is the benefit now, wider seats, a $12.00 meal and a few glasses of inexpensive wine. Even your luggage which has a priority comes out at with everyone else's. Get your act together or change the statis to Elite Economy.",-1

First one was most rude and you could feel the anxiety in the air, she made us wait with my nieces’ belongings to “organize” it so it that we could carry it down the loading aisle, she continued to bombard my sister about the ticket for my niece when she is a lap child, stupidity. When we boarded the plane a stewardess had no idea what she was doing. I was flying with my sister and her 20 month old child and there was tons of seats available and our tickets had us separated but apparently it is too much of an inconvenience to let me sit with them from row 43 to row 37 - initially she said it was fine and then changed her mind and made me move all my belongings and sit in my initial seat and now my sister is alone without aid, (despite her being a strong mom that I know could handle the situation but anybody with children will always appreciate the extra hand). Anyways she was indifferent and unaccomodating to the situation and used whatever power she thought she had to control the situation. Unfortunately, these two employees made your business look bad today and your company has to suffer due to their inadequacies and pure ridiculousness.",-1

I’ve flown both trans-Atlantic and trans-pacific flights so long haul is nothing new to me. On this flight, I’d like to address the food service that United has. Airline food is a means to an end. You’re trapped in a metal tube and you eventually get hungry, so the food service is there to help pass the time. I have to say that this is one of the worst meals I’ve had while flying. The chicken was horribly dry and had some sort of paste covering it that made it inedible. The rice was also dry and crunchy. My seat mates made the same comment and eventually just covered the food back up. On other long haul flights I’ve had some sort of snack service about half way between the 2 meals but not on United. If you’re on one of United’s long haul flights, be sure to bring snacks on board!",1

2018-12-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Des Moines to Missoula,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly with United again,False,"  Will never fly with United again, and would give 0/10 if I could. We were all boarded onto the flight, made to wait, only to deplane and be given 30 minute delay after 30 minute delay. After 2.5 hours of this, the plane was ultimately delayed by 9 hours. The flight attendant was unfriendly to the irritated passengers and did little to help reschedule flights. Also no food vouchers were given. Worst experience with an airline I've ever had.",-1
2018-12-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gillette to Denver via Charlotte,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1, not allowed to sit together,False,"  Gillette to Denver via Charlotte. Unbelievable, my wife and I bought our tickets 6 months ago and we were obviously placed in middle seats on different sides of the plane on purpose. We got to the gate early and we were informed we were not allowed to sit together with our fare, our 500 dollar fare. This used to never be an issue to move seats so family can sit together. This airline is budget trash now and we will never fly United again.",-1
2018-12-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Newark,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,experience was horrible,True,"  London Heathrow to Newark return, and both flights were delayed. My experience with United Airlines was horrible.  The first one was delayed about 2,5h because the pilot couldn't reach the airport (problems could happen, I understand) and then because the aircraft needed maintenance. But the worst thing happened from Newark to London where the flight was delayed about 5h because, again, aircraft maintenance. After an overall 8h delays in two flights, their horrible customer care could only offer me a useless e voucher(expires in one year, I am not from USA and might not come back within one year) that doesn't really match the real cost. I can understand they can have problems,  but they have to change compensation policies. You cannot offer me an evoucher in order to oblige me to fly with you again. Not recommended at all, I'll try to stay away from this company.",-1
2018-12-24,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Houston to Newark,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2,Tired little plane again,True," Houston to Newark. Same problem with the menu as with our flight from Sydney to Houston. Ran out of a dish by the time the staff got to me - there were only 16 people in business, 6 of those children so I had to have one of the snack boxes from economy. I don’t understand. You know how many people are booked so how hard is it to have both options available? Staff very helpful and polite. Not his fault I know. Tired little plane again with tired and very well used amenities. No internal entertainment on this flight either. Bad luck if you did not have a tablet or phone to use the United App. You need to up your game United and quick.",-1
2018-12-23,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Reno to Los Angeles,2.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,3,Very sad experience,True,"  While flying from Reno to Los Angeles they ask us to put our carry-ons down the airplane. We did. As soon as we looked for them, after the flight, my husband’s carry-on was all mashed and rotten. I told the person in charge that “please next time be careful because look what happened”, he looked, didn’t say anything and totally ignored us. Very disappointed with his attitude and not even an apologize. Very sad experience, we will never trust United Airlines with our baggage.",-1
2018-12-23,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Antonio to Appleton,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,terrible experience overall,True,"  San Antonio to Appleton. A terrible experience overall. The airline will get you from point A to point B but it will be very uncomfortable. The aircraft in the fleet are tiny. Most adults do not fit comfortably in the seats and many could not stand up inside the aircraft without hitting their heads on the low ceiling. There is also very little storage space on the plane. I am considering buying a one way ticket with another airline for the trip home because United aircraft are so uncomfortable. They claim the small aircraft are more economical because of cheaper fuel costs due to reduced weight and better aerodynamics, but other airlines use larger aircraft and provide far better service for only a few dollars more.",-1
2018-12-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to New York via Houston,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2,tired facilities and tired staff,True,"  Sydney to New York via Houston. What a tired airplane with tired facilities and tired staff. The seats were so close to the isle I had to make sure my arm was inside the seat. Food when it came was great but when asked what my selection was from the menu I was told that I would be put on a waiting list to see if my choices were available I assume after feeding first class first which I have never heard of before. I asked for a bottle of water and was told due to cut backs it was one bottle per person per trip but they could refill it. Breakfast, I was told off by the stewardess who was super stressed during the flight, because I did not eat my corn flakes which she had to tell another passenger she could not have so I could eat them! My god, I paid over $7000 for a seat on this airplane to be told off because I did not eat my corn flakes! The bathrooms were so small I did not even bother to change my clothes not only because I could not move but there was either water or urine on the floor. Maybe I am spoiled as I have flown business with Qatar Airways and Emerites and they are spacious planes with stewards that are not stressed with big bathrooms that are cleaned regularly and a menu that when you ask for something that’s is on the menu you are not told you will be waitlisted. Selection of movies very old. No new releases. No offer of any magazines or papers nothing. So I sit here at Houston waiting to board for the next leg of my journey hoping and praying it’s better than the one from Sydney or I won’t be flying with United long haul again.",-1
2018-12-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"Horrible, horrible experience",True,"  Nashville to Houston. Absolutely horrible. Time management is little to none. No staff updated on delay after delay after delay. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6:25 and after one hour sitting on the plane we weren’t told a single thing about the status of the flight. Very unprofessional staff and crew. Horrible, horrible experience.",-1
2018-12-22,0.9,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Miami,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,our experience was wonderful,True,"  Chicago to Miami.

Everyone and everything else about our experience with United was wonderful! Exactly as we expected and more. Very friendly and helpful staff, and even better customer service. Thank you!",1
2018-12-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to San Diego via San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,crew are so rude,True,"  We booked a flight from Pittsburgh to San Diego via San Francisco. The flight got delayed by 3hrs (they delayed for an hour at first, then for 2 hours and the final announcement said 3hr delay) and we missed the connecting flight. The crew are so rude that they didn’t even apologize. They said all they can do is book another flight the next morning for free of cost. Seriously? You ruined my trip and there’s nothing you can do about it. They are not even paying for my accommodation for overnight stay in SF. I’m never ever gonna fly through United again after this trip.",-1

2018-12-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to San Diego via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,kept on changing the time,True,"  Pittsburgh to San Diego via San Francisco which is having a layover of about 1hr 30mins. Just after 10mins of the boarding start time they announced that the flight is delayed for about an hour and later on they delayed it by another 1hr and then finally 1hr 30mins. They kept on changing the time. We knew definitely we would miss the flight, so we asked for other options that we would get as our flight is at 9:09. There is only one flight in the next day morning from SFO to SAN and we were on standby. We asked for compensation or even just providing us the accomodation but they said that they can’t as it is not the issue with maintainance and it is an air traffic issue. Finally they confirmed another flight from SFO to SAN which is at 12:52. This is too bad for an airlines, there were like almost 10-12 people who want to reach SAN and to do that everyone has to reach SFO by midnight and catch another flight at 12:52 in the next day. It’s like missing the whole day, and they can’t do anything for that. United are so irresponsible and they were just smiling without even saying sorry. They kept saying just wait here, don’t go anywhere may be the time would change but it kept on increasing hour by hour. I don’t even know how can they state themselves as No.1 in customer satisfaction which is completely false. The same kind of delay happened with few other airlines, but they are good at least they felt sorry and even compensated us.",-1
2018-12-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Reno,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst airline I have ever been on,True,"  San Francisco to Reno. This is the worst airline I have ever been on. I have given this airline 5 chances and every time something goes wrong. I would understand if an airline had delays some time but every time is inexcusable, I feel like it was false advertising the times it says because that is most certainly not the real time. I have never given a review in my life but I am so mad I need people to know so they don’t have to go through the same thing the experience I have had with this airline is terrible, and I will not be flying with them again.",-1
2018-12-20,0.5,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Monterey to Denver,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,$440 to extend our ticket 8 days,True,"  My wife and I booked a flight from Monterey to Colorado Springs. An emergency occurred an we had to extend our stay 8 days. United demanded $220/ticket or $440 to extend our ticket 8 days, hiding behind company policy (bureaucracy), even though the price of the ticket did not change. We contacted Southwest Airlines, which gave us our ticket back for $89 each. We love Southwest Airlines because they are personal and don’t nickel and dime us like most other airlines. We have changed tickets before with Southwest Airlines with no problems; if the new ticket is more expensive we simply pay the difference, which is fair. We are seniors and fly a lot, both nationally and internationally. This year we flew round trip to Colorado x 2, North Carolina x 2, Hawaii, France, and the Republic of Georgia. Nationally we prefer Southwest and believe they have the best overall value.",-1

The United flight was delayed 3 hours, and when we landed I received a message that my luggage did not arrive, it will arrive on the following flight. The customer service is terrible, lacking compassion and totally inefficient. My luggage did not arrive within 24 hours, as promised. 2 days later and I still haven’t received my suitcase. They have lied on the phone and miscommunicated between me and the driver service. What a disappointing and ugly experience. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.",-1
2018-12-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Oaxaca via Houston,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Holding customers for ransom,True,"  Toronto to Oaxaca via Houston. Holding customers for ransom? I recently had an unbelievable experience flying to Mexico on United with a bike. Booked the flight several months back, checked with the United call centre on charges for taking a bike and confirmed what I'd read earlier on the United web site. Both made it clear that if the bike bag fell within weight and dimensional limits it would be charged simply as a second item of checked baggage i.e. $50. When I checked in at the airport, the United agent insisted that I owed an extra $200 (!) for the bike even though it came in under 50 lb limit and was the standard dimensions set out in the Airline's limits. No amount of back and forth would bring them round to honour the original terms. And curiously my two companions who had checked in a little earlier for the same flights also with bikes were charged much less - one paid $25 as it was his first and only item of checked luggage and the other was charged nothing for his bike as second item (his was in an identical Evoc bike bag and weighed just a little more than mine). The experience left a very bad taste. What can you do but pay up when you have already bought the ticket and will be leaving soon? This seems to be the kind of business practice you would expect of a dubious, disreputable business or one might experience in some part of the world where corrupt practices are more common.",-1

Many people on the plane were coughing. I’ve never experienced this on an airline.",-1
2018-12-13,0.7,Business,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Houston,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,5,"Friendly crew, decent foodv",True,"  Sao Paulo to Houston. United Airlines have a lot of old planes still it seems. This is not necessarily a bad thing, I love these old 767s they have substantially more personal space (pitch and width) than newer aircraft. Friendly crew, decent food. I pegged an exit seat as a result of status gained through status matching. None of the airlines from the United States touch my preferred airlines in Europe Air France, Alitalia but United is now for me competitive with American and not so far behind Delta as it was.",1

2018-12-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,What kind of operation is this?,True," I have yet to be treated this horribly! I have flown for work for the past 10 years on different airlines including United and this has been the worst experience. Since when are passengers treated with such distrust and since when is it ok for United employees to be this rude to passengers? Initially I was questioned about the size of my carry-on which I travel with all the time. She right away said to check it and I tried to put it in the size checker and I explained that I had placed my laptop in the outside pocket which is why it looks “thicker” so let me just put it inside the bag and it’ll be fine and she just said “if you check it you can’t check the laptop” and I replied “no, the point is I’m not checking it bc it fits” and she said “it’s doesnt fit so check it - I made an announcement earlier so you should know”. Firstly, the bag fit, and so she just walked away without saying anything and then secondly since when is it ok to “scold” me like I “should know”? Really? Then I cut my finger on the size checker and I asked a flight attendant for a bandaid and she said she can’t get one. I said I’m bleeding. She said she can’t leave the front and the first aid is in the middle. I said isn’t there a flight attendant in the middle and she said “yes but they are assisting someone else”. What kind of operation is this? Then later after 10 minutes she comes by and gives me a bandaid without a word. What kind of customer service is this?",-1
2018-12-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Savannah to Portland,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,doesn't care about you or your money,False,"  Never warned about flight cancellations and was told it was confirmed the night before with no help from the desk. Was told there was a walmart and that was supposed to make up for it. Waste of time. Incompetence to the highest degree and a lack of care. Even told them I had orders to be reporting into for the military and all I got was an 'oh well' from the desk staff. Then when I tried to transfer flights they wouldn't because ""they would lose money"". United Airlines is a terrible airline, doesn't care about you or your money, and would rather you just stay put instead of getting you anywhere.",-1
2018-12-09,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Minneapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,will never fly United again,True,  Houston to Minneapolis. There was no prior warning of our flight being delayed until five minutes prior to the plane boarding. Every 30 minutes they delayed our flight another 1/2 hour for a total of five hours. Then at 12:00am they announced our flight would be cancelled. They sent all 200 passengers to customer service where three employees worked to put customers in hotels. After 1.5 hour wait in line we were informed there were not hotel rooms left for the night and we were forced to sleep at the airport. There has been no compensation for our trouble and our seats for the flight we were booked on in the morning were all the way to the back. They upgraded the business class passengers to first class conveying they do not value the every day vacationer but cooperate business who frequently use their airline. I will never fly United again.,-1

The person at the check-in desk was incompetent and rude. I had a valid document for travel to Mexico with an official green card stamp in my passport and she got confused and told me she has never seen this and decided to leave with my passport and go somewhere without even explaining her actions. When I confronted her and asked not to leave with my documents she said: ""I won't be able to help you, I just can't deal with the attitude right now"". When I finally made her talk to the supervisor and he looked at my documents and said ""oh yeah that's ok"". I wasted 40 minutes of my life. One star United, I think that becomes a new normal for you.",-1

We pay extra to leave Milwaukee early in the morning -  first we were delayed in Milwaukee for 3 hours then arrived in Houston delayed 3 hours. Arriving at night in Leon mexico. We had a wedding to attend and now we are not going to be on time. We talk to the staff from the airline they were rude. This is my first and last trip in this airline. Our worst trip ever.,-1

One of the worst experience with this airline. Will not recommend anyone to travel with this airline. Staff at Calgary airport was very rude. Me and my wife were travelling to Mexico even upon asking seats were given separately through out our travel. We had to request passengers to switch seats. 2 hand carrys were allowed for 2 passengers. Staff was still forcing us to book the hand carry as it was too big. Me and my wife travel alot but next time we will pay extra $$$ to travel but will not be travelling from United Airlines. Not recommended at all.,-1

When we arrived at the airport (after our driver being pulled over which took time) we still had one hour before departure. As I have never flown on United before, I didn’t know the procedure. We went straight to the baggage drop and told them we’re getting late, instead  of informing us to go to a different kiosk to check in our bags, they referred us to the monitor. And while we were trying to check in the monitor said to see an agent, (which was ONE agent in the corner which was somewhat helpful) but his supervisor was so rude and mean and didn’t let us even talk. I didn’t expect someone at a supervisor or management position to act this way. Do United not give supervisor training to their managers? I was very disappointed and our whole vacation mode was ruined. Now I’m waiting at the airport and will have to wait for another 4 hours.",-1

I wish I could give zero star to this airline. I promised myself two years ago not to travel with United ever again, but my trip was booked by my agency and it was too late to change it.

2018-12-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Charleston to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,delayed and then cancelled,False,"  Charleston to Newark. My flight was delayed and then cancelled. My experience with staff at the boarding counter was not good. She was rude and not sympathetic to the situation. Another staff at the boarding counter was understanding and helpful. There was a flight available for an earlier time than what they rescheduled me for, but the first staff did not inform me at the ticket counter. I was later told over the phone when I called United. I was told there would be a $200 up charge for that flight because it was in a different class than I had originally booked. I do not feel a customer should be charged when their flight was cancelled and there are available seats on the next flight. I ended up having to switch airlines and airports which is now causing even more delays. I also purchased a non-stop flight and am now going to have a layover. Not a good way to treat your customers United.",-1
2018-12-03,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Hong Kong,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5,you can't beat the price,True,"  Chicago to Hong Kong. This was my first time flying a United long haul international route. I made sure I included long haul since you can fly a 90 minute international flight from Chicago to Toronto which is no different from their domestic service. I flew in their soft-release of Premium Economy on my way to Hong Kong, and regular economy in my return flight. I say soft-release since in reality you only get the new seats, and not the full service which goes live down the road - the new seats are great! I got into these seats due to the new 777-200 configuration on my trip to Hong Kong which is a 3-4-3 setup in economy, and 2-3-2 in Premium Economy. I had a front row seat which means the tray and TV comes out from underneath the seat, and both worked really well. The seat itself is wider than regular economy by a couple of inches, and you can feel it. It also reclines by an inch more which didn't make much of a difference to me since I need a full bed to sleep well, but it was nice to lay back a little more with the foot rest they provide. You have a nice little storage container on the side of the seat which is perfect for tablets and smart phones, and the chargers worked great. It charged my phone up quickly, and it was easy to open and pull out my tablet when I watched some shows. The screen these new seats have is notably wider, and had a very responsive touch screen that worked well, and the quality was in HD. I watched the latest Mission Impossible, and the screen felt like a nice tablet now. On top of that, the entertainment selections were great. They had a lot of new movies, classics, and international choices. Overall if the Premium Economy is only a 25-33% upgrade cost, then get it for the seat alone. That said, I had the old 777-200 configuration on the return flight, and there is no Premium Economy seats yet. The biggest disappointment in the old configuration is no chargers, or they don't work. I know the old configuration is on it's way out, thank god, but they haven't been touched much since the 90s. United loses a point for not at least adding some proper chargers by 2010. Otherwise, it's a typical economy seat. Not bad, but nothing notable. Finally, the service itself overall was good. Obviously your crew will vary, but it seems like the international crew to and from Hong Kong was friendly and top notch. They had all announcements in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin which is great for the Chinese travelers on board. To me it says a lot how they accommodate foreign travelers to where you're heading. As I said earlier, the service was very friendly and active. Meanwhile the food isn't bad. The breakfast on United is quite good since I had the omelet on the way over, and the quiche on the way back. The dinner was okay, but overall it's 4/5 for the food. Overall United gets a solid review from me. I think they are treated a little unfair at times. Are they ANA? Of course not, but they aren't a 2-3 out of 10. To me a 2 signals they are god awful, and that isn't the case. The only true negative is the Wi-Fi, and it isn't worth the price. As long as the flight is smooth, comfortable, and the staff is friendly, then they do a solid job. Finally, for a 15 hour flight costing only a $1000, then you can't beat the price for what you get.",1
2018-12-03,0.8,Business,Business Class,Singapore to San Francisco,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5,very positive experience,True," Flew Singapore to San Francisco on 14 Hours flight. I was not expecting much from United. It turned out to be a very positive experience. The B787 plane had a 2-2-2 configuration but very comfy seats. Onboard entertainment was very good. The service was excellent. I did not regret having booked this flight rather then Singapore Airlines flight which departed 30 minutes later and was twice expensive. All in all, if United keeps this level of service and engage professional personell then they should be very competitive for business class.",1
2018-12-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Burlington,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Delayed multiple times,True,"  Albuquerque to Burlington. Worst airline experience I’ve had. Delayed multiple times, missed flight and no effort put to helping me get home the same day. Asked to wait 24 hours for next flight despite the fact that I missed a job interview due to this. Gate agents would not place call to attempt to hold flight. Placed in a hotel 30 minutes away and told it was the most convenient. Told my food vouchers would work at the hotel. Hotel had no restaurant and vouchers did not work. Awful experience. Will do everything in my power to never fly United again.",-1

Hands down the worst airport experience I’ve even had they switched gates without informing anyone so I ran to the new gate after I was planning to board. No employees were present at the desk. Banged on the door while the plane was still attached 5 minutes later the plane detaches an employee comes out and tells me they can’t re connect even tho the plane hasn’t event began to think of moving. They switch me to the next flight 3 hours later. Flight gets switched gates 3 times and delayed. I’ve been in Chicago airport from 9 am - 4pm all to wait for a one hour flight. On my trip home through O Hare my flight arrived but it there were no gates available for over half an hour causing the whole plane to miss there connecting flights. When I got off I asked if they could page the airline to hold it and the lady told me to run because I have 10 mins. So I home aloned it all the way across the airport to find my aircraft still sitting there but of course they wouldn’t let me on because the door was closed causing me to have to stay in Chicago overnight. Do yourself a favour and don’t choose united airlines.,-1
2018-12-01,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to San Jose del Cabo,1.0,,2.0,,,3.0,3,They will lose a frequent flyer,False,"  I have a few other flights booked with United and for numerous calls to them and sitting on the phone for hours I cannot book a premium seat online because the company will not accept Canadian credit cards. They tell me they are working on the problem but in the meantime I have to take my luck when it comes to getting a seat on the plane that either isn't at the back of the plane or not being able to sit with my husband and usually getting a middle seat. What does it take and how long does it take for a website to take a credit card other than an American one and why isn't this a priority getting it fixed or why can they not take a credit card over the phone to book the seat? I will not book another flight with them until they fix this problem, just sorry I have already booked a few more with the assumption that it would have been fixed by now. They will lose a frequent flyer because of this.",-1
2018-11-30,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lincoln to Philadelphia via Chicago,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2,under such stress handled it amazing,True,"  Lincoln to Philadelphia via Chicago . Was a very uncomfortable flight, no free wifi, Two hours of coughing sneezing sleeping people. No leg room.  My return flight was scheduled at 11:30, I was there at 10am. All day delay after delay then at 5 pm it was cancelled. I was stranded in a city and was having the worst anxiety and panic attacks. The women at the desk was an angel. She and her coworkers at Lincoln Airport were my saviors. Under a lot of pressure these women handled every situation with patience and calm and believe me there were a ton of upset flyers. I usually don't write reviews but they are worthy. On the other hand I called United and the women on the other end was uncaring . I told her my situation and she said pay for another ticket. I responded with I don't have the money, she said "" well then I can't help you"" and hung up on me. It was then I went to the counter and the agents helped me. I was given a hotel and food for the night (which was very much appreciated ). These women under such stress handled it amazing. As far as United itself I am not sure of future use.",-1
2018-11-30,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tampa,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,Great customer service,True,"  Chicago to Tampa. I was skeptical about trying United Airlines again since I had bad experiences before. The pilot did everything in his power to get us out of ORD early but alas we got out late due to traffic on the tarmac. Not their fault. So when I landed in TPA, I was in a rush to get off so I can get my dog and go home to sleep since I had work the next day. Once I got home, I realized that my iPad was not with me. I call the United help line, which they weren’t much help. Then as I was trying to contact TPA again, United called me. I described my lost iPad and they said that it will be locked up for me to get. Great customer service.",1

I fly United to Asia and Europe and always had good flight experiences. I pay for the middle seat of Economy Plus exit row and enjoy conversing with the flight attendants. I'm on a flight to Tokyo now and the cabin attendant alerted me that there was an 4 seat empty row in the back and took my coat to hold it for me so when the seat belt sign was off I could have it to sleep laying down on the flight. That was special! I have found cabin attendants on all my United flight to be friendly, professional, and go beyond the job to serve their passengers. I am Asian American and never found any of the slightest prejudice.",1
2018-11-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Sacramento,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,100% would never recommend United,False,"  If I could, I’d give United negative stars. My flight from Raleigh to Sacramento was canceled and when I called United about changing the flight, they rudely told me that they have nothing to do with purchases and to call whomever I purchased the ticket from. When I did finally get a new ticket, I was booked on a 6.5 hour flight back home which left almost 30 minutes late and damn near made me miss my last flight. The service on this flight was so awful and sterile, they offered drinks once during the entire duration and food you could purchase. My last flight (also United) left also 2 hours late. 100% would never recommend United to anyone.",-1
2018-11-28,0.8,Couple Leisure,First Class,Dallas to Providence via Chicago,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,Flight attendants were very friendly,True," We were upgraded to First Class on the Chicago-Providence leg of our trip. The Personal Device system worked very well with a good selection of movies to choose from. The seats were comfortable and spacious. We received warmed nuts prior to our dinner. Dinner consisted of a side salad with balsamic dressing, pesto chicken with quinoa and a slice of cheese cake. The salad dressing was light, chicken very tender and tasty. The cheesecake was very light. This flight was the 4th one of our round trip from Providence to Dallas. All 3 other flights were on A319s in Economy Plus. No frills service and all flights were on time. Flight attendants were very friendly on all 4 flights.",1

We had a weather delay of 5 hours, then the plane arrived but we had no crew and pilots. How can you not know about the weather prior to it actually occurring and adjust to it? They charge you for everything too. I'm hoping I never have to fly United again! I could drive to Austin faster next time!",-1

2018-11-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Chicago,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1,flights both got cancelled,True,"  Ottawa to Chicago. When I was at Ottawa my flights from Ottawa to Chicago and Chicago to Indianapolis both got cancelled. I went to the gate and the agent collected my boarding pass and the information on my flights. After that she assured me that she will rebook my flight to Indianapolis. Suddenly, she got up and made an announcement about passengers moving upstairs to rebook their flights. As the passengers were told to follow the person leading the way upstairs, she followed behind. I was with her as she clipped my boarding pass on her card board. Then when we reached upstairs I was still walking with her slowly matching her pace. We talked on the way and she only assured me that I am not to worry.  I reminded her that my boarding pass is with her and she simply handed me my boarding pass. I was now the last person in the queue. I waited for 2 hrs 30 min for my turn. She was around but my turn fell in with the other representative. I explained her my flight details and college scene again. She first told me that she will book me in the flight to Indianapolis via Washington. Then she told me that she will not be able to do that because I have two separate bookings and that she is not able to merge. In fact, she also told me that she will not be able to provide me with an accommodation when the passengers right next to me on the other counter same class ticket and same flight were being provided accommodation because they spoke on the helpline phone number. Now I am in the middle of an unknown place, Ontario without a place to stay and without any flight plans for the next day even when there are seats available with United airlines.",-1

I booked my flight online and I had assigned seating for all my flight. United change my flight from LAX to BUF. Now I cannot do assigned seating. I am 320 pounds and I cannot sit in the middle seat. I may now be force to book another flight and lose $200+ on my previous flight. This is the worst experience I've ever had with a flight and I will never fly United again.,-1

How a company with such disregard for the consumer experience can survive is beyond me. Cancelled / delayed flights, overbooking punishing those who bought the tickets most recently (often due to emergency), absurd fees (flight change, baggage, minors traveling alone), and shoddy customer service (canned dismissive responses when you bring up concerns) make using this airline unbearable. I have sworn to never fly them again regardless of the cost difference. It is not worth it.",-1
2018-11-23,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,not recommend this airline,True,"  
Portland to Houston. We planned a normal flight and didn't realize there was a difference from ""basic economy"" and economy (let it be known when leaving this review there isn't even an option for ""basic economy"", just first class, business class, premium economy, and economy), and when I arrived for my flight I was forced to check my bag because a carry on and a personal item are not included, only a personal item. This forced me to pay an additional $30 for my already expensive flight. I would not recommend this airline to anyone unless they are planning a short trip where they don't need to pack actual cloths, otherwise you'll be blindsided by the additional fee(s). I've flown with several airlines and have never checked a bag, all other airlines allow a personal item and carry on. No one should be forced to read through all the fine print to realize a personal item and carry on is not included on an economy flight. I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone and will not be using their services in the future. 1/10.",-1

The staff is rude, nobody cares about the passengers, etc. I bought a ticket and was not told I would have no choice of seat until after it was paid for. I have an anxiety disorder and of course was given a middle seat. Knowing I was going to have a panic attack, I tried to resolve this before the flight. Needless to say, United could have cared less and needless to say, I sure indeed had a panic attack in the middle of my flight. It was humiliating and could have been avoided if this airline cared. I will never fly them again, I don't care how much I have to spend next time!",-1
2018-11-22,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2,Backward airline,True,"  Chicago to Dallas Ft Worth. Backward airline that struggled to meet customers needs. Simple flight delay from O’Hare, delay was nearly 2 hours. I requested a rebooking to OKC, and would deal with my car issue myself. I was told that OKC was too far and out of range for a transfer, but was offered Houston and San Antonio. Honestly, was not even sure how to respond to this backward logic. Looking at other reviews I am not surprised by the lack of service provided. Just to be clear, my flight was delayed due to maintenance required on the plane. Again, I do not understand how this “sneaks up and is unforeseen”.",-1
2018-11-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United is the worst,True,"  Newark to Los Angeles. United is the worst. We bought economy tickets thinking we were getting a good deal. When we showed up at the airport, it turns out our ticket includes a personal item only, no carry on. Who travels across the country with just a purse? Our options were to pay $400 for the privilege of carrying on our carry ons or $120 to check them, meaning adding an extra 40 minutes to our thanksgiving commute. This is horrible customer service and basically extortion - we were left with no choice but to add a huge amount to our already expensive tickets. Never flying United again.",-1

The crew were very kind and helpful, but the food was awful. I ordered pancakes, and I was told that they didn’t have anymore (business class) but the only thing left was scrambled eggs (powdered yolks) . So I ordered them, and as soon as I had the first bite, I had to spit them as quickly as I could out of my mouth because the taste was so terrible.  Why can’t they make an effort to give good tasty food ? My wife and I were flying business class, but the food was not second, not third, but tenth class. I think that the airline should give the passengers what they pay for, and believe me, it’s not cheap. I hope that this review will be read by some authority working in United Airlines.",1

How is it that all pets on all other airlines, except United, are $75? Why does united charge $125? That is more than my own ticket.  I am trying to understand this and this price is one way! So now my dog cost me over $300! Double what I paid for my flight. This is outrageous, never flying United again.",-1

It's getting difficult to tell the difference between United Airlines and the real low-cost carriers, United is becoming even worse low cost carriers! I actually have to wait in line to verify that I don't have any “carry-ons” or I can’t get my boarding pass. I am a “pre-check” passenger! I actually put Spirit ahead of them in the common sense category! This is crazy and unprofessional for such a legendary airline!",-1

The staff were very hostile during the process of delay. We were transferred from one gate to another, we went to several gates, still, no aircraft to fly us to Heathrow, until after 7 hours. We were given a website to voice our concern, I did. No one from United Airlines customer care bothered to contact me. Rather I was sent an email to confirm if one of their agent's contacted me. I responded no. I have not heard from United Airlines since then. Poor service.",-1
2018-11-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Honolulu via Newark,2.0,,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,will never fly United again,True," Charlotte to Honolulu via Newark. My flight started out fine it was a morning flight leaving from Charlotte, that was the best thing about this review. From Charlotte I was heading to Newark, from Newark to Honolulu. Once we arrived in Newark we had to stay on the plane for over an hour after we landed due to weather, and a medical emergency at our gate we were supposed to dock in. Causing me to miss my flight, not a big problem as it's usually pretty fast to get another one booked. I went to the customer service desk where there was about 50-75 people in front of me with only on agent working, she was the only one there for an hour and half. It was during this time that I received an email saying my flight had been delayed by 30 min and I could have made my flight, well when I got to the gate there was nobody there and the door was shut. During that time what appear to be the manager was just standing there watching the situation not doing anything. I called the customer service line where I was on hold for an hour or so before they finally answered. From there they we're able to get me on a flight the next day and didn't offer to put me in a hotel or anything for the night. After I got my flight rescheduled I was given a number to call to get my luggage transferred over. After all that I received an email telling me my new flight had been cancelled and to make another one, this time I received a link to make things go by faster, I was able to get a flight arriving at a pretty late time the next day (they had already taken 2 days of my time off) so I called the luggage people again to get my bags on to my new flight, they said it wouldn't be a problem. Well now my bags are lost and I just missed 2 days of my vacation. I will never fly United again.",-1

I was forced to fly United because there were no last minute southwest/Alaska flights where I was going. Now I know why everyone says don’t fly United. Pretty sure their employees get a bonus for being as incompetent as possible. They don’t tell you that you can’t carry on a bag unless you buy a more expensive ticket. Had to wait in line just to pay $40 to check my miniature carry on bag. Not a single person expressed any sort of sympathy or understanding. I will never fly United again and I hope they go out of business due to their poor decisions as a company. What an awful airline.,-1

I used to fly United often, until their performance became intolerable. Every now and then I fly them out of necessity and I am reminded why I need to keep avoiding.

2018-11-17,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Houston,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,2,Never flying United again,False, Cancun to Houston. Watch out for ‘basic economy’. This means you cannot even have a carry on with you. We had a carry on and they charged an extra $83 at the gate to pack it. They also purposely separate people flying together to get you to pay extra to sit together. The flight was not cheap even booking weeks in advance. Never flying United again.,-1

RDU-DEN smooth flight, one beverage service. Seats for Economy reasonable comfort. Attendants were smiling. No inflight entertainment, used own personal device DEN - KOA (757), seats were cramped for a 6 1/2 flight. PAX in front reclined, we could not move - we were under 5 ft 5 inch in height. Pitch was 31 inches. Worst part was the cleanliness of the plane. On the previous flight, some one vomited into the seat back pocket (row behind us). When the current pax attempted to clean the tray table, the smell was horrible. Flight attendants did temporarily move the pax in that row until workers could clean the area. In the meantime, we were inhaling the smell and germs for about 30 minutes. Beverage service (water) was offered 3 times during the flight. Attendants were courteous and pleasantly smiling. Inflight entertainment was seat back, complimentary earbuds offered by attendants. Varied and large selection of movies, TV shows and audio. Movies were about 3 months from original release date. Rating - RDU to DEN 8, DEN to KOA 2",1
2018-11-15,0.9,Business,Economy Class,Houston to La Guardia New York,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,4,Good experience!,True,"  A Tuesday afternoon flight from Houston to La Guardia took off 30 minutes late because of ATC restrictions due to weather issues in the New York area. Throughout the orderly boarding process, we were kept informed of the situation. On board and on the ground, the pilot did a superb job explaining the weather conditions we would encounter on our route, that we should be ready for turbulence and that we should have our seat belts on. I felt very reassured. After take off he described the route the flight would take and his intention to make up time. These were very helpful and the flight for the most part was not stressful. We arrived at our gate only 10 minutes late. The cabin service was truncated because of the bumps on the way but that was understandable. All in all I appreciated the frequent communication from the cockpit. Flight attendants were attentive to safety issues. I was in an aisle seat in a 3x3 configuration and the middle seat was empty which was a welcome relief from the otherwise tight space between rows and seats. Good experience!",1

There was an over head door in first class with a broken hinge and maintenance took 20 minutes to get to plane to put duct tape on. Then we had to wait 40 minutes to take off. Being an hour late to Houston we missed our connecting flight to College Station. Now we have to wait almost 8 hours for a flight. Also we had to call the boarder for our dog to cancel pickup tomorrow and cannot take care of our outside livestock and pipes in sub freezing weather. United attempted to appease us with 2 x $10 food vouchers. Will never give them me business or money again. United totally dropped the ball on this.,1
2018-11-14,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Austin to Washington via Chicago,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,such a pain to fly with United,True,"  Austin to Washington via Chicago. Does flying economy means going through different customer service attitude? When you pay more they smile and if you only pay economy they are the worst with you? Cause it sure feels that way. No carry on, $30 to check in a luggage that could totally fit under the seat but since you’re only group number 5 well, you cannot have more than a purse with you, seriously? Also, if the plane is everything but full, do I still need to put my purse in my computer bag cause otherwise I can’t board the plane? Yes of course! otherwise you would be treated like a number 1-2-3 but you didn’t pay for it so let me give you a hard time for fun. Any way, expensive, rude and such a pain to fly with United. Good luck to all future travelers that dare to be just normal and pay only for economy.",-1
2018-11-13,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Minneapolis to Chicago,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,United Airlines customer review,False," Minneapolis to Chicago. I paid extra to sit in Economy Premium. I was shocked to see that I had to board with zone 4. By the time I boarded the plane, there was no room for my carry on. I only found room about 20 seats behind where I was sitting. If I had know this would have happened, I wouldn’t have paid the extra fee. There is no point paying extra when you can’t even have your carry on close by. I called United to voice my frustration and the attendant didn’t seem to bother to hear my story and she hung up the phone on me. I will never fly a United again and I will not recommend it to anyone I know. I will gladly pay for a more expensive ticket with another airline.",-1
2018-11-13,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Roatan via Houston,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,Thank you so much United,True,"  Vancouver to Roatan via Houston. We have flown several times with United and we chose to fly with United again. The service received while booking the tickets and during our boarding and during the flights was outstanding. We were never ever late, we got in early to our destination. We just booked our tickets last night to go on a trip to Roatan, Honduras from Vancouver BC in March 2019. The reason I am posting this review is because we booked the tickets on 2018-11-10 at night on United Airlines, and the next day we checked Google and the tickets went down significantly for both tickets, Mel from customer service was so nice and spent so much time with us on the phone to re-adjust the price and do the refunds for us so that we would not lose our seats. I have never seen someone so dedicated and so nice and willing to accommodate us. We are from Canada not the US, I did not expect this kind of service. Totally amazing. Not only do we choose United for the outstanding service they provide but also because their prices are very competitive. Thank you so much United.",1
2018-11-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Guatemala City to London via Houston,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,by far the worst experience ,True,"  Taking a returning flight from Guatemala to Houston and then a connection onto London (all with United Airlines), my arrival into Houston was delayed by 20 minutes at landing due to a plane breaking down at the gate. No instruction was given to connecting flight passengers as to how we should proceed. Alongside several customers on the flight, we had under an hour to clear border control check, hand luggage check and get to the gate (this was at least a 10 minute walk away from the baggage check). At Border control, staff were very rude at a clearly stressful point. When told about my situation, they just told me to join the back of the queue. I was told to speak with a United Airline representative, but no employees were working at the time. Three different individuals I had asked throughout this entire process gave no care. I even tried to join my friend at the back of the other queue and was told to go back. He managed to get on the flight. At baggage check, the queue moved at a steady pace but once my bag was on the machine, there seemed no urgency with getting checks through the machine. Machine stood at a standstill for about 10 minutes. When one of the employees was asked by a couple next to me about the hold up, they laughed and just said they were waiting for another person to monitor the scanning. After my friend had informed the check in desk of my situation, I arrived at the gate 1 minute (8:16) after the flight departure time. I was told by United airline staff to join a long queue of people waiting to speak to customer service. The customer service desk was next to my flight gate at E2. This was an even greater example of the poor customer service on display as I began queuing at 8:18pm and was not served by a customer service employee for the airline until 9:10pm. Up until 9:00pm They had one employee serving all economy travellers and one other serving premium. There was no employee around to even speak with customers waiting in the queue. At roughly 9pm they finally brought out 4 more employees. After eventually being served, the staff was very helpful in clearly a stressful situation. Rather concerning was the fact her colleagues seemed to be more interested in talking about their diets and whether they could have some of the chocolates out on the desk than serving the long queue of dismayed customers in front of them. After receiving my hotel and food vouchers at 9:29pm, I decided to grab some food and go across to the Marriott Hotel. After thinking this experience could not get any worse with this airline, I was informed that the credit given for this hotel did not even cover half the room rate. I was given a voucher for $57.33 and the total room amount came to $139.23 ($81.90 deficit). As an airline that is meant to uphold strong customer service qualities (this I read in my magazine on the returning flight to Houston from Guatemala - they even had a page devoted to it in the magazine), I can safely say in the last 18 years of flying all over the world that this was by far the worst experience of customer service I have ever seen. Fortunately I received my bag, but was then lumped with a costly train journey to get home as I was originally meant to be going in the car with my friend who caught the earlier plane.",-1
2018-11-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Cincinnati via Brussels / Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,voucher will go unused,True,"  Madrid to Cincinnati via Brussels / Newark. Will not give this airline one more dollar of my money! My daughter flew home from Madrid, Spain in July. When she went to retrieve her checked bag at Newark airport it never arrived. To top it off because they had scheduled her flights so close together she missed her connecting flight to Columbus. The only positive thing about this whole fiasco was the nice gentlemen I spoke with that rescheduled her on a later direct flight arriving in Cincinnati. That was a two and a half hr car drive but oh well. By the time she arrived in Cincinnati there was still no trace of her missing luggage. We filed the claim and were given approval for $300 to purchases necessities until her bag arrived. It did arrive 5 days later minus a brand new Gucci belt ($360 value) that my daughter purchased in Madrid. Once again we filed a missing item claim. We filed our claim with receipts for all the purchased items and proof of purchase for the belt. Guess what we received in the mail? A $100 check and a $200 voucher for a future flight reservation. They didn't even give us the original $300 to cover the purchased items that they had promised. I've sent a follow up letter that I'm sure will receive no response so all in all we were reimbursed $100 for $660 lost. Great math! I can promise you the $200 voucher will go unused.",-1

Last night, I have tried to print my boarding passes from from their website yet the system told my that I needed to obtain them from the airport. Arrived at the airport, one one of their employees refused to give them to me and said that I was late. A gentleman arrived 3 minutes later but she gave him his for the same flight.",-1
2018-11-12,0.9,Business,Economy Class,La Guardia to Houston,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,4,my positive experience,True,"  New York LGA to Houston. Departure on schedule, arrival 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Nearly every seat on the plane was taken but the overhead cabins accommodated everyone's luggage. I had an aisle seat in a 3 by 3 configuration. The rows appeared to be rather close to each other -- the small TV screens were right in front of you and the seats seemed narrower. I did not watch any shows. There were two drink runs, pretzels were complimentary. A decent selection of snacks and meals were on sale and I bought a mezze platter for less than 10 dollars -- it was tasty and filling. The two male flight attendants in the economy cabin kept the place clean and were polite and helpful. The bathroom I used was clean too. The cockpit crew kept us informed as appropriate. The flight was smooth without any turbulence. The leg space was sufficient for me. This was my first domestic flight on United in several years and I was very pleasantly surprised by my positive experience -- right from the orderly boarding procedure to the quick disembarkation at Houston.",1

I arrived early to my gate and without prior notice, the gate changed. I did not receive a text or email notification of this change. An hour prior to departure, the screen in the terminal read the Gate at which I was located. When we were not boarding, I realized the gate had changed (within the hour). Long story short, I missed my flight and the crew did not acknowledge their lack of communication during this time. I am not impressed with the professionalism and service of United and will take my business elsewhere.",-1

Rebooked me on an earlier 5:45 am flight but did not tell me. The text they sent told me my flight was at 8:15 am. Something like this happens almost every time I fly United. I’d choose another airline, but United has a near monopoly at many regional airports. Even the crew were complaining and surly.",-1

Overall, the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. On my flight I shelled out nearly ten bucks for a cheeseburger which was nothing more than a microwaved rock, very dissatisfied. Total ripoff. No wifi or entertainment. Upon the plane parking in San Jose, I and many other travelers were left to walk down the street totally blinded about where to go to get our bags. Multiple terminals later and on the verge of tears, I found the baggage claim across the street. I don’t even have words for that. As someone with asthma and other health issues, walking that far and not knowing where to retrieve my bag was pretty upsetting. Not cool. Try telling the family member who is picking you up that you don’t know where you are however, you are walking multiple blocks to find out where to obtain your bag. I don’t travel much these days however, when I do, chances are it won’t be on United.",-1

This is my first and last experience with United Airlines, they caused me to pay for my bag since they have different policy on their economy tickets, then I purchased two tickets for 2 different passengers and they were no where close to one another -  terrible customer service at the gate. I would never recommend them to anyone, AA will be first choice from now on.",-1

We didn't make it to the airport in Charleston till 1:30am they gave the car to someone else because we can't call up in the air. We have been up for over 24 hours. We are extremely exhausted and we are still sitting at this airport because we have to wait until a car comes available. Oh by the way it's 10:50 am November 7, 2018 I can't even think straight anymore so disappointing. The most important thing in my sons life and i missed it.",-1

I flew 6 different times with United Airlines in the last few days and not one single flight has a working WiFi and all the staff said the same exact excuse. This misleading and false advertising they sold us a service with WiFi and they don’t even have WiFi on the plane. I don’t know how they get away with stuff like this?,-1
2018-11-03,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Amarillo to Edmonton via Denver,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline I've ever flown,True,"  Amarillo to Edmonton via Denver. Worst airline I've ever flown. Extremely bad on time performance. My flight from AMA to DEN was delayed for over 3 hours which would have resulted in me missing my connection in Denver. I had to reroute through Houston and ended up over 5 hours late. Every airline has delays but I have had more flight delays due to mechanical issues on United than any other airline by a large margin, both in total number and percentage. I bring an extra change of cloth when flying United because i can never trust it will get me to my destination on the same day. Only reason I still occasionally fly United is due to limited selection of airline to several smaller airports I have to fly into for work. I would never fly United for any personal trips nor would I recommend this airline to anyone else. To me, if i can't get there by another way, it is not worth going. Even for work, I am seriously considering flying into other airports up to 5 hours away on Delta and drive from there. It is that bad.",-1

I have purchased tickets on line from United air web site in economy we got to the airport they treat us like the enemy because we purchased economy tickets then made us check in our Carry ons and charged us for them. When we tried to talk to that lady that was checking us I was told to file a formal complaint, as we were under the understanding that we can have one Carry on each. The manager walked away and would not talk to us. Just walked away like we were not there. Very rude to have someone like that to represent United Airlines, I was very disappointed in United. It took one hour and fifteen minutes just for the attendants to come around with water and that is on a two hour flight.",-1
2018-11-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cabo San Lucas to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,been a horrible experience,True,"  On October 31st 2018 I had a flight booked through United Airlines to return to Baltimore from Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Booking through United Airlines was the worse mistake I’ve ever made. Once we left SJD airport (Cabo) at 12:05 pm everything seemed normal until we got closer to (IAH) Houston we were suppose to arrive there at 4:30 pm to make it to our connecting flight at 7:45pm and we were supposed to reach our destination at 11:38 but the pilot said we had to go to San Antonio for a little bit until the storm cleared up when we landed in San Antonio to get more fuel he then told us that since he exceeded the maximum number of hours to fly for the day which was 12 hours that we had to wait for the new crew to board which will take about 45 minutes. So went through customs as instructed and got some food because they told us that we won’t be able to leave until 8:15 pm. While waiting the airline staff told us that they will have to reschedule our flight but they will put us in a hotel room once we reach Houston, TX.Then we start waited and they they boarded us on the plane around 10 pm to wait some more. Finally we take off around 10:30 pm and reach Houston around 11:30 and we spoke with a customer service representative and she said they will not give us a room because it was weather related but the pilot told us he ran out of hours to fly for the day. So then we got stuck staying in the Houston airport overnight waiting for our flight at 12:00pm. Then around 10:00 am I received notification that our plane wasn’t going to arrive until 2:06 since they had to find a plane for us. So then I spoke with another rep and she said they weren’t going to do anything for the inconvenience or even offer a food voucher. And we were stuck at the airport with nothing since our bags already made it to Baltimore. The thing that makes me even more disgusted is the fact that my cousin that flew through Southwest leaving a few minutes after us was able to get from Cabo to Houston without any delays and she made it back to BWI by 11:45 pm on 10/31 while me and my other 3 cousins made it to BWI at 5:30 pm on 11/1. This has been a horrible experience all together and the staff of United is very unorganized and they lie and tell their passengers anything to get them hush while not delivering on their promises. I will never ever fly with United Airlines ever again and believe me my family and friends will not fly with them either.",-1

We were made to unpack and repack two times until we had the weight evened out between our suitcases, which was a lengthy and embarrassing experience. I understand that there is a weight limit, but with this slight overweight in my suitcase it was really a question of whether one or two jeans go in my suitcase or my boyfriend's. Really petty, will try to avoid United Airlines in the future.",-1
2018-10-31,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Sydney,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United has continually gone downhill,False,"  This is not about the flight, this is about the Customer Service. I booked a flight one month ago on United to Sydney. When I went in to make a matching reservation the site stated a change had been made to my itinerary and to give them a call. When I gave them a call they said I had to pay $300 more for my ticket, they also wanted me to pay a change fee. This is not right, I did not cancel my ticket, they cancelled my ticket and I should not have to pay more when they changed my ticket and I had no say at all. I switched from Southwest to United about two years ago because I thought I got better Customer Service and flights, I was wrong, United has continually gone downhill in the last two years and I will be switching back to Southwest and any over seas travel will not be on United. They are dishonest and to not care about the customers at all. If I hadn't checked the ticket who knows how much extra they would have charged me on the day of the flight.",-1

2018-10-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to New York,2.0,,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,Worst airline out there,False," San Francisco to New York. First, they don't use our Known Traveler Number for our tickets so we were denied of using our TSA Pre and had to wait in the regular line. Then we had to pay 55 dollars for our carry on bags since they had no overhead space (all I was carrying was that one carry-on). Prior to passing security we paid 25 dollars for a personal bag. (Someone next to us had to pay for their carry on as well and were not happy). My sister's monitor for the entertainment system did not work. I don't want to put every employee of this airline in the same pot but the ones at our gate were not professional and my sister and I heard them laughing at us while we headed down to the plane. I never write reviews. Worst airline out there. I will never fly with this garbage airline again.",-1

We were greeted by a pleasant lady who, after looking at our ticket, said that we could not use the lounge since we were not flying international!

2018-10-29,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Hong Kong via Chicago,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,They really aren't that bad,True,"  I was flying to Minneapolis from Hong Kong for a friends wedding, and of all the airlines, United was among the cheapest and had the best connection times. I was pleasantly surprised by how normal or pleasant it was. For one thing, my flights either arrived on time or early! For the international leg (i.e. HKG-ORD and subsequently ORD-HKG), service was quite good. While the 777s they operated both seemed a bit old, but the cabin was in good repair. My HKG-ORD flights were on 777s with the 3x3x3 seating configuration- an increasingly rare sight, though really, there's not that much of a difference compared to 3x4x3. I think their food is pretty decent. I normally fly Cathay and I liked the food on United better - I especially appreciate that the snack was a sandwich, not a pot of instant noodles. Cabin crew were quite friendly and periodically walked the aisle with water. I also appreciate their provision of Illy's coffee. While it is by no means the best coffee in the world, it's a high quality brand nonetheless. My flight managed to arrive in Chicago roughly 2 hours ahead of schedule, which was great because the member of staff that rechecked my bag to my connecting flight was kind enough to help me get booked on to the earlier flight- she didn't seem particularly enthused, but I suppose that's understandable when it takes about 10 minutes to actually put everything together, so I appreciate her effort either way. Now to talk about their domestic product- My flight to Minneapolis St. Paul was onboard one of their mainline flights, which operated on an A319. The interior and the seats seemed quite new, and the leather seats that they had were actually quite comfy. There is no seatback TV (which I'm used to for these short hop flights), but they do have onboard WiFi like they do on the international flights that allow you to view movies on your device for free- that makes up for it. The cabin crew for the flight seemed somewhat less hospitable onboard, and for the hour and a half flight- the a bag of pretzels and water was provided- there wasn't a proper beverage service. On my way back, I had a very pleasant encounter with the check in staff at MSP, where they answered some technical questions (mainly regarding whether I had to reclaim my bag at ORD like I did on the way in) as I checked my bag and were kind enough to carry my bag onto the conveyor belt. As I was flying on a United Express Flight that operated an Embraer E-175, boarding was fast since it is a very small plane. For this particular flight, I had very friendly cabin crew and full beverage service (including hot coffee). I also got a very nice bag of cookies. This flight also went without a hitch. I would remark however, that seeing as all United Express flights are docked at Terminal 2 in Chicago while mainline United flights are docked in Terminal 1, it is quite a long walk between the terminals- then again they did give me a 3 hour layover, so I probably needed that and more. Based on this experience, I'd definitely give United another go. They really aren't that bad. Some may actually say they're fairly good, especially when you consider what you're getting with the amount you spend.",1

Horrendous, worst food and service ever. Economy plus seats were not great - not much different than economy and the crew were bored and uninterested. To cap it all we had a three hour delay in Newark. United / Continental used to be a great airline, after twenty years, never again. I think they need to realise their is always a choice.",-1
2018-10-28,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Charlottesville to LAX via Chicago,4.0,,5.0,1.0,,1.0,1,It was a nightmare!,True,"  It was a nightmare! My wife, our 10 month old baby, and myself were flying out of Charlottesville to LAX via Chicago. At the CHO airport we were delayed due to inclement weather for a few hours. Finally when we boarded the plane, they discovered a leak. Unfortunately for us, the mechanic was a few hours away. Good thing United was able to get a different plane. But all our connecting flights to LAX were already gone. The events up to this point were likely outside of United's control. Now we were stranded in Chicago for the night with a baby. When we all went to the United customer service, the reps argued that the delay was due to bad weather. For 40 minutes! The baby was crying, everyone was angry and tired. Is it hard to pick up a phone and check with the flight crew/United? We could have been already in a hotel resting. Finally, they called and confirmed it. With unhappy face, the reps gave us hotel vouchers, as if they were making us a favor and as if we were bugging them. The hotel was a good 30 minutes ride outside of the airport area. But they had a reliable shuttle and we made to our 6 am flight without problems. Never we will fly United again. I was going home after a 4 month long Active Duty training and my family joined me at the last phase. I paid for my wife's seat out of my pocket with hopes that we would have a pleasant flight back home. By the way, entertainment was really bad. You had to pay to even track the flight.",-1

Flying with United Airlines was very easy. In Honolulu Check in was fast and easy with people to help with the fast self check in system. Flight on time boarding went smoothly attendants were helpful. Meal service was fast and efficient.and beverages served often both ways, from and back to Honolulu. I would definitely fly with the friendly skies again, Layovers were only a few hours. My thanks to all the employees on the aircraft and ground which made my flight very comfortable.",1
2018-10-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Colorado Springs,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,bad customer service,True,"  Atlanta to Colorado Springs. Tried to give United a second chance after the bad customer service I dealt with a few months ago, they're still as bad. I paid an extra $130 to fly into a closer airport for convenience, but our flight was directed about an hour and a half away (via driving). The pilot said a plane had broken down on the runway so we'd have to taxi around until it was cleared. Well about 30-40 minutes later he announced that we were running out of fuel and needed to re-fuel at the airport 1.5 hrs away. After deboarding and waiting at the gate to refuel for another 2 hrs we were told if we didn't take off within 20 minutes that the crew would surpass legal work hours and our flight back to the original airport would be cancelled. Of course we couldn't have boarded and taken off in that time, so we were all left stranded nearly 2 hrs from where we needed to be. Since we'd been in limbo not knowing if our flight was delayed or cancelled, we couldn't make proper arrangements for getting home in the 3 hrs we sat there. They told us to speak to customer service (which was another hour wait) just so we could be told that all shuttles were booked, there were no flights with the next 12 hrs, and that the cancellation was ""weather related"" so they wouldn't reimburse us for travel expenses. (We descended to land and there definitely were NO weather/fog issues...) Basically our only options were to pay another $200 to rent a car or Uber home, or to be stuck at a hotel for a few hours until the next available flight. I had already paid an extra $130 for convenience and that was ruined by waiting an extra 3+ hours in an airport and dealing with snotty customer service people; I wasn't about to pay another $200 to get home! I could've lived with taking an Uber or driving myself home if United would've reimbursed us, but they refused... so instead I had to stay at the hotel and wait for another flight the next day. All for what would've been under a 2 hour drive... Oh and the $20 food vouchers were only valid in one location at one time, so I had to spend all $20 at Starbucks which was kind of annoying. Plus the ""free in flight entertainment"" never worked.",-1

The flight started at 11:35 PM from Delhi, for the first 14 hours of the flight we were not served any food or even water.

I was charged $975.00 to transfer miles from myself to my wife so we could use our mileage plus miles to get a ticket. For this I was charged $975.00. Using mileage plus miles cost me more than if I just purchased the tickets via my travel agent. Beware unless you want absurd transfer miles fees. Be very careful using mileage plus. I will never use United Airlines again.,-1

I had paid for business class, but on both of these legs, their business class is the same seat as economy class, only they do not assign the middle seat. So no leg room for a 4+ hour flight, but I didn't have to fight over the arm rest. I feel like I was ripped off. Service on Brussels Airlines was terrible. I contacted United customer service, and they apologized for not allowing seat assignments. Window vs. aisle really doesn't matter if your legs are jammed into the seat in front of you. I am writing this to warn people that you think you're paying for a business class experience and you get a cattle car squeeze. I will choose another airline in the future.",-1
2018-10-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Burlington,,,,,,1.0,1,our 10pm flight was cancelled,False,"  Newark to Burlington. This is funny, because I can't actually review the flight. What I can review is the United customer service, which was terrible. After multiple delays, our 10pm flight was cancelled for maintenance. We were told to go to a customer service booth across the Newark airport at 1:00 am, but soon found that there was no one at the booth. The gate agent had just led us to a place where no one could help us. I got on the phone with a very kind customer service agent who couldn't help me - all the flights for the next two days were booked. We cancelled our trip entirely and were told that we would get a hotel voucher - but there was no one there. Instead, we ended up trying to find a hotel on our own because they said we could send a receipt in. All the hotels were booked in a 20 mile radius, so we took a lift back to my apartment in Philadelphia, which cost $150. I called the next morning and was assured I would get that money back. I submitted a form, and an agent online assured me that all I had to do was submit another form. I tried to submit that form, couldn't because I didn't have a valid ticket because I had gotten a refund, and called again a month ago - when I was again assured I would get reimbursed. It's been a month and I have heard nothing from them. If you like wasting money, having people tell you nice things with no follow through, and getting stranded in New Jersey, United is your airline. If you want to get to a destination, walking would probably be a more efficient use of your time.",-1
2018-10-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to San Antonio,3.0,,4.0,,,3.0,1,no longer be traveling United,False,"  San Francisco to San Antonio. I have never know a company that has shot themselves in the foot more consistently than United Airlines when it comes to customer service. My latest experience with United Airlines has pushed my husband and me over the limit. We will no longer be traveling United. The last several times we have booked tickets through United, we have selected our seat assignment, and every every time, United has moved us from our original seats. We have tried changing our seats back on line, with an agent over the phone, and with an agent in person. I am always given an excuse as to why our seats have been changed and why they can not be changed back. Today’s flight was the same, our seats were moved, only this time, my husband and I were seperated. I spoke with an agent who could not help me. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. A supervisor was extremely rude. She was defensive and condescending before she even tried to help. Finally, I was able to explain my situation. She told me the UA website clearly states seat assignments are not gaurenteed. I suggested that choosing seats should be removed from the site. Her answer was, “No that won’t happen, the site says there is no guarantee. Your seat was changed and I can’t change it back.” I asked to speak to her supervisor. Her response, “No, you may not speak to anyone else.” I asked for her name; she refused to give me her last name. I told her I understood that and asked for her employee ID number. She refused to provide any kind of identification. I asked her where her office was located. All should would tell me is that she was in Houston. I am aware that complaining about seating arrangements in first class sounds trite and normally would not warrant a complaint what is most frustrating and unacceptable, is how I was treated by this agent. My husband and I are premeier Silver member who will now be taking our frequent business to other airlines.",-1
2018-10-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Fresno via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Very upset with United Airlines,True,"  Minneapolis to Fresno via Denver. Very upset with United Airlines. We had a four day trip planned. Both of us had to take days off work without pay. We got to the airport and a flight attendant for United Airlines never showed up. Because of this our flight was delayed 2 hours so we missed our connecting flight. There were no immediate flights to our loaction. We should have been in California by 9.30am, we didn't get there until 4.30pm that day. We lost a whole day of our vacation all because a flight attendant didn't show up, we were punished. I want to see United Airlines make it right and credit us tickets to use in the future. Very displeased and upset. First vacation we have taken in years and we lost a whole day because of one of their employees.",-1

Was sat next to a man who took up his own seat and half of mine - aren't passengers like that required to buy 2 seats? Then the flight attendant proceeded to offer the guy (who was much shorter than me and sitting next to a normal sized person) an open seat in the emergency exit row for ""more leg room"". Did she ignore me on purpose? I'm not impressed.",-1
2018-10-20,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Houston,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,impressed with the airline,True,"  London to Houston. This was the 1st time I flew with United and sent them a message on Facebook messenger. an instant reply and after a discussion they kindly upgraded me to an economy Plus. Flew from Dublin to London (LHR) with Aer Lingus and was met a United Representative on disembarking the flight due to my short connection time which was an hour I was fast-tracked through flight connections and security. Instead of walking from the main terminal building I was driven right up to the gate where the United flight was parked. As I entered into the satellite building the boarding staff were professional and took consideration that I was deaf and allowed me to pre-board before everyone else. The aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 reg N78009 and it looked like it was ageing so it was. The seat for 22L was comfortable but as it was a 10-hour flight the extra leg room was worth it for the comfort if you are 6 foot tall like me and it is a good seat as I was happy with the legroom and a good whole window to yourself as seat behind me did not have a window. Despite that, the 20-year-old aircraft (almost as old as I am), the actual flight was smooth no problems was very impressed with the attentiveness of the crew and was well looked after with drinks and snacks for a 10-hour flight. The meal was Thai Green curry and dessert was chocolate ice cream. I was very impressed with the airline, the crew and was beyond expectations for me. I would definitely fly with United again from London (LHR).",1
2018-10-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Houston,1.0,,1.0,,,3.0,1,choose any other airline,True,"  United Airlines policy for a flight cancellation or change should be considered usury. I paid for something called ‘flight protection’ which should have protected me in case I needed a cancellation or change. But instead of a refund you get airline credit. Credit you can only use if you spend an additional $200.00. I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of and robbed but have no other choice since I need to make my trip and can’t lose the money I’ve already spent. If you’re flying, choose any other airline, even if you must make stops and can’t fly direct, it’s still better than to fly with United, who will take advantage of you if they have the chance!",-1
2018-10-19,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to West Palm Beach via Newark,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,carry on classed as excess bag,True,  I never have a bad word to say.  However for the first time in my life i am going to write a negative review on United Airlines. Firstly I accept responsibility in booking economy ticket and not understanding that I could not take a carry on bag. I was relocating to Florida so i had all my belongings with me. I found out i could not have a carry on and then found out the cost of my carry on would be classed as an excess bag so i would be charged 150 dollars for the smallest bag that i could have put under the seat of my chair on the plane. The supervisor wouldn't help me i asked could i upgrade my ticket so i would be aloud a carry on. One kind lady said she could help me because everyone could tell how ridiculous it was to pay 150 for a tiny carry on. In the end i almost missed my flight while was waiting for the one agent to refund the 150 dollars. I was in tears at this point and none of the agents cared that i was about to miss my flight. Eventually made the flight Took the bag on the plane as a carry on and checked my bank today to find they took the 150 dollars. They put me thru misery and were so rude to me and then i thought well at least they done a nice thing and refunded me the 150 dollars and then i check today and they had put the charge thru afterwards.,-1

Horrible - every time I fly this airline it takes forever to board, or there’s a issue with the plane resulting sitting at the gate for an hour. I had a business meeting with important clients and I thought I’d give United another chance. Word to the wise if you need to be on time somewhere, use Southwest; fast boarding, and fast take off. If you like waiting on the tarmac, use United.",-1
2018-10-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Detroit,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2,every time I regret it,True," This is by far the worst airline in the US. I have flown on it multiple times and every time I regret it. The seats are uncomfortable, they always delay and cancel flights and their staff are not helpful at all. Today I arrived at the airport with my sister and asked if I can check in with her. They refused, checked in my bag (under weight) then weighed her bags and realized that hers was over, but by then we didn't have mine to shift the weight. We moved way out of the way and attempted to move things to the carry on, but their employee just stood above us insisting we go to the designated bag opening area and refused to understanding that our flight is close to departure time. Then I literally ran all the way to the gate and told them my sister was on the way and their first response was to look for alternative flights, an option I had to insist on rejecting. Now I'm sitting on the plane and it's not even moving, they're doing maintenance work.",-1
2018-10-19,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Philadelphia,2.0,,2.0,,2.0,2.0,2,taking my business elsewhere,True,  Denver to Philadelphia. My complaint is with customer service and lack of response. Both my wife and I are Mileage Plus Explorer members for several years and were charged $25 each way for baggage. The process to get reimbursed is now approaching two weeks and nobody with any common sense can correct. $25 each way is not a big deal but can't imagine how a major problem would be handled. As a frequent flyer with United will be taking my business elsewhere and giving away my miles so I don't have to deal with incompetence,-1

There were numerous seats that were empty, so I had the whole row of 3 to myself. The selection was good for the in flight entertainment. The adjustable tint windows are a good touch. The food/beverage service was the most rushed I have ever had on any Int'l flight. Rather unprofessional to rush the passengers on a long flight like that. The dinner sucked too with this noodle chicken concoction that was awful. The mid flight snack was a very small sandwich and half a kit Kat. Also the socket for phone charging below the seat didn't work. Overall flight was good with the exception of the food/beverage service.",-1

Extremely cramped and limited space for luggage in your seating area. Does no accommodate all body types, it feels like they think everyone is 5'4"" and 150 pounds. This is a 5 hour flight and no entertainment unless you download their app on your smart phone. I do not recommend this airline at all. I have flown countless times all over the U.S. and in Canada and Mexico. This is without a doubt the worst airline I have come across",-1

I kindly asked the flight attendant about my connecting flight to Pittsburgh. I was concerned whether I could make my connection. She then asked me “Why would you book a flight so close to one another?” in a disrespectful tone. How does that address my concern?  It’s no one’s business. Moving forward, I would appreciate if flight attendants would answer the question they are asked and address the concern.",-1

Yesterday I arrived to my flight 25 minutes prior to scheduled boarding time. I  find out I could not get my bag on the flight because the cut off is 30 minutes prior to boarding. Missing the cut off by 5 minutes and with no other flights out that night I agreed upon taking the morning flight out. I arrive to the airport at 5:20. I walk right up to an agent showed them my new boarding pass and he then pointed his finger to the kiosks and told me I had to go over there. My boarding pass then does not read on the kiosk so I then have to wait for the one man working all of the kiosks In the airline while The agents continued to talk amongst themselves behind the desks. Finally the man comes to help me and then tells me I have to check in with an agent and my flight is leaving in 30 minutes to get my bag on. I walked to the desk and quickly explained that I need to get this bag on that I am going to miss my flight.  I Demanded someone to Help me and another lady told me that she could help me so I ran over to her. She put mne on the next flight without telling me and checks my bag. I am now running through TSA and  get to the gate at 6am to see the door close and I begged them to open it back up and they told me you are already put on the next flight.,-1

I'll try and summarize, my actual review I wrote was over 5000 characters. Both of my flights were canceled, the one coming home forced me to get a hotel in Houston. Trying to get questions answered, I called, emailed, left voice messages, and all I got was I can't help you try another department. I paid for the front row both direction and was given a ticket towards the back of the plane. Even with the confirmation email in hand I had problems getting the seat I requested and paid for (they were empty). The planes had no entertainment, no radio, nothing, I would have been fine with this if the ticket wasn't $500, but more in line of $200. Both flights were morning flights and the served cookies as the snack, really who wants cookies at 8 am. The flight crew came by once to hand out the cookies and a tiny drink just enough to get your mouth wet craving more and once to collect trash at the very end of the flight. After countless attempts to get answers and solve my issues I had to threaten a credit card dispute to get a response. What did the offer? A worthless voucher that would have cost me more money if I could have even used it.",-1
2018-10-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Baltimore via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Farewell United Airlines,True," Milwaukee to Baltimore via Chicago. I have flown for over 40 years with many, many carriers. Sometimes you see how a company performs from small things. I flew recently short distances with Southwest. Friendly staff, carryon allowed of reasonable size, no cost for changes and 2 or more bags to check for free. Today I am flying United from Milwaukee to Baltimore via Chicago. I get to the airport with a standard carryon bag (has fit in all carriers I have used) and a little bag that vould fit inside the carry on if they only allow one piece. The measure at the counter fits but you cannot carry it on, the lady says. Well, I can put the larger in the smaller but no that is bigger than their “standard” measures. I am forced to check the bag in and have to pay 30 USD. Also, this “airline” splits the economy in economy and basic economy. With the latter you cannot pick your seat, check in on line and cannot bring a carryon that fits criteria for all other carriers. And when I told the lady at the counter about what the rest of the world does because they like their passengers, they even argued with me. Well they lost a customer for my lifetime at least. One can argue that is just one customer, but customer care starts with one customer at the time. Farewell United Airlines. You have managed to lose me and my family as customers for ever!",-1

After having to reschedule due to a hurricane my experience with this airline was awful. They kept me waiting at the airport for six hours after delayed by my flight twice and then they ended up putting me on an entirely different airlines plane. Of course it didn’t have any of the amenities I paid for and was probably the smallest plane I’ve ever been on in my life. Staff were rude and seemed like they’d rather be anywhere else except work. I understand why though because if they treat their employees anything like their customers I wouldn’t want to be there working for them either. Take my advice try a different airline. You’ll save yourself a lot of stress and hassle.",-1
2018-10-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Raleigh Durham,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,the worst customer service,True,"  Everything started with us missing our flight because they only had 2 officers at immigration when 3 planes came in. We of course didn’t make it on time for our flight, when we asked United to help out at least with a free hotel stay they said it wasn’t their problem. I think if one of their guest misses a flight because of migration being so irresponsible for not having more officers well at least United should help out their customers. We went to pick up our luggage for the flight that will now leave tomorrow and it took 3 hours to get our luggage from them. United has the worst customer service.",-1

My stay last night in Houston was unexpected but I had such a nice experience. I missed my connection because my first flight was delayed by almost an hour. The ticketing agent gave me a better seat after I volunteered to check my bag. I’m very tall so any chance I get to sit in the emergency row is always appreciated. Once we arrived in Houston, I saw that my connection was in a gate on the other side of the airport and they had already closed the boarding. I found my way to customer service and staff was so sweet and helpful. She set me up with a new flight, a better seat, a room at the Holiday Inn, and meal vouchers. I happened to not be in a rush to get home so I was able to relax and not worry. The shuttle drivers to and from the airport were both very nice and helpful. The Good Eats bar/restaurant was great and the service was awesome. The shuttle driver suggested I not miss the peach cobbler which I enjoyed very much. Friendly smiles and great food, what more could you ask for? I slept well and enjoyed my stay.  Thank you, United Airlines and Holiday Inn for making my unexpected layover better than I thought it might be.",1

We arrived at Oakland airport at 8am and a quick check found that we should have gone to San Francisco international. Despite our best efforts arrived too late for our reserved flight. United Airlines were wonderful and put us on an evening flight at no extra charge which they did not have to do. Thank you so much. The seat room is more in these planes than in international flights.,1

The first and last time I would ever fly United Airlines. Flying out of Newark to Vegas there was no WiFi and no TVs on board. The flight was delayed for more than an hour due to maintenance (a bathroom sink) which they never even fixed within that time. The flight had such a bad odor; turned my stomach. The flight back from Vegas to Newark was again unacceptable. The TVs and WiFi again did not work. It was just a terrible experience.,-1

Worst airline I have ever flown, total rip-off. It’s a wonder that they don’t charge you with a boarding fee and waiting area fee.  I’ve never encountered a intercontinental flight where you will be charged for baggage! And if you have a short stopover you will be charged again! Checking in baggage for a 10 hour flight is 60$ and for a 3 hour flight 60$ again. Needless to say that you have to pay 25$ handling fee every time. So for a round trip you have to pay 240$ excl handling fees for 1 suitcase. And 1 pound to much will cost you again. Total Rip-off! The service is poor, the quality of the aircraft and food is bad, and their staff is most of the time unfriendly. I fly a lot and I urge anyone having a chance to choose your airline not to go for United Airlines, especially if you fly outside the US.",-1

Our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue so we were unable to make our connecting flight. I rebooked to Raleigh with the help of a very patient and helpful employee but it was not an easy process. The entire system was shut down so he was unable to rebook on the computer and had to do so over phone. He was also not able to print a customer service voucher for our taxi to Raleigh because of the system being down as well. Not a great performance by United Airlines software developers.

Ran out of breakfast omelette and only had cornflakes left towards the back of the plane. Had an internal flight Orlando to Houston earlier in the day, was abused by a steward for not standing up to let a passenger sit next to me although I had turned to the side to let her in. We were told entertainment was free through our phone, but it wasn’t. On return trip dinner was indistinguishable, was called chicken but was mixed in with cheese, pasta dish was also undescribable. A “snack” of a par baked turkey roll was dry. Once again omelette ran out 3/4 of way down plane, alternative French toast was terrible. The entertainment was good though and easily accessed.",-1

By far the worst airline I've had the misery of using. My flights were delayed with no forewarning. I had a delayed flight from Charleston to Chicago where I missed my connecting flight. Then my flight got rebooked for the next day so I had to sleep in the airport. Then the flight the next day was delayed. Now I'm returning from San Francisco to Houston and my flight is delayed again, with no other flights leaving from Houston to Charleston today so I guess it will be another night at the airport. I will never fly United again nor would I recommend it to anyone.",-1

We boarded late and were not notified at all. It is currently 7:47pm and we have still not left the ground. Apparently their is trouble with a “navigational computer” going down. Then we were told that they could not find a route for us. I understand that these things happen but for the price we paid we should not be over an hour behind on our departure. This is completely unacceptable and unprofessional. We will not be flying United again. I wish I could give a 0 score for all categories.,-1

My girlfriend I got round trip tickets to the UK through Primera Air. After arriving to the UK, we found out that Primera Air went bankrupt and we would be stranded in the UK with no alternative way home. We read online that other airlines would be offering discounts to those effected. After calling multiple airlines to no avail, United Airlines was the only one that accommodated our situation. They offered us discounted tickets and we were able to make it home. I would like give a big thank you to United Airlines for helping us get home with no inconvenience.  Thank you United Airlines.",1
2018-10-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Houston,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,choose a different airline,True,  Newark to Houston. I booked first class a week ahead of time. A week later we rushed to the airport and still arrived an hour early before they boarded the gates. Right when we were at the desk they told me I couldn't bring my pet to first class. My mom had to argue with someone over the phone but since our time had been wasted and we were now in a hurry I had no choice but to downgrade my first class seat to economy. Not only did I end up wasting 150.00 usd but they also charged me an extra $75 to downgrade. The luggage were also suppose to be free for first class but of course I also got charged for them. While I had to literally run with two heavy carryon bags over to my gate my mom spoke to a customer representative and she was informed that a lot of their clients bring pets to first class. She even told my mom that we basically got scammed. We were trying to complain about this issue with the people working there but they have blatantly ignored us and made nothing but excuses. Service is not only really rude but they are basically scammers. We now have to argue with some people over the phone so I can get my refund. I highly recommend that you choose a different airline if you can. I hope to never do business with united again. Even my bad review doesn't do enough justice for these scammers.,-1
2018-10-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to San Francisco via Chicago,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Unacceptable customer service,True,"  Portland to San Francisco via Chicago. Unacceptable customer service at counter. Flight attendants exceptional on flight from San Francisco to Portland. United now punishes you for choosing economy by not allowing you a carry on and charging you $30 per bag that you are mandated to pay or not fly. So every economy ticket is $30 more out of the gate. And if you are in a rush due to traffic car rental drop off etc., and get to the gate with bag that you have already paid to ck online, you will be charged $30 more for not taking time to check it which if you did take time to check it you missed your flight. We rushed to the counter for check in with mobile boarding passes in hand. They were three ticket agents and no one in line. and we were told they would not check bags because we were three minutes past cut off. There were five people in the security line and we would have made our flight if we had gone straight to the gate. Instead They rerouted us and that plane was delayed by two hours and at this point we do not know if we are going to make our connection and get home tonight.",-1
2018-10-06,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Montreal to Seattle via Chicago,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,seats given to standby passengers,False," Montreal to Seattle via Chicago. On 7 September 2018 I purchased two Economy Plus seats (upgrade) for our flight from Chicago to Seattle on 19 September (flight number UA8481). On 7 September I received an email confirmation that said our purchase was confirmed for Economy Plus seats and we had been assigned to seats 21C and 21B, exit rows. We paid $181 for the upgraded seats. On 18 September when I went to check-in, I was told our seats were 39D and 39E; the back of the airplane. I called the United help line and talked for about 90 minutes to Maria in their offshore site. I was reassured that the seats had been changed back to 21C & B. I was not convinced and talked to Supervisor and she too said our seats had been changed back. Upon my check in Montreal for our flight to Chicago, we received boarding passes for seats 39 D & E. The Supervisor said our seats had been given to standby revenue passengers and there was nothing she could do to get us back our seats. United without warning or any kind of communications decided that they know what is best for us and gave away our seats, after taking our money and saying the seat purchase was confirmed and we were assigned the exit row seats. United Airlines obviously does not care about its passengers and it is no wonder it is has such a low industry ratings for customer service. Their help desk is not to be trusted and wasted over 90 minutes of time. United did refund the $181 and gave us middle row seats of 9B and 10B, but we were not together and sat between some large passengers. I will never fly United Airlines again, as I do not trust them to keep their word. After this ordeal I emailed United Airlines, and they said they were sorry. I told them I am sure you are saying sorry a lot if this is how you treat your customers.

Then to top it off they put us on a later flight and even though I paid for assigned seats ended up having to argue with customer service who didnt even apologize and was rude and very short with us. Very disgusted with this airline will never use United Airlines again.,-1
2018-10-04,0.6,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Beijing to Chicago,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,3.0,4,lack of professionalism,True,"  Beijing to Chicago. Overall pretty good though United Airlines has a problem with lack of professionalism displayed by their FA's. The food and IFE were pretty good. The 2-4-2 cabin configuration was a bit cramped but not too bad. Seat comfort was ok though storage space was limited. This was a Polaris class flight BTW. We got off to a bad start before taking off when of all people the lead FA grabbed my wife purse to store it without saying a word. When my wife said she needed meds for her purse the FA turned this into power trip asserting her authority. I spoke with her before take off and told her we did not appreciate her approach. After all its not her purse and a simple explanation would have been in order vs. turning this into an argument. I also reminded her we had spend ""a lot of money"" for these Polaris biz seats and expected proper courtesy. To her credit she apologized and was most attentive during the rest of the flight. However I heard two other FA's gossiping about passengers with backpacks in a demeaning way. Unfortunately the FA's as a whole have a long way to go on terms of professional behavior. They could learn this valuable lesson from star alliance parties like ANA, Asiana and Thai whose FA's show true value towards the passengers.",-1
2018-10-04,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to New York,4.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,Very disappointed,True,"  Chicago to New York. I had a small personal item and suit. They asked me to check in one of those items because they are both considered personal items. I usually travel AA, but for unavoidable reason I had to fly United airlines for this trip. I have used other airlines with the same situation and they always give me a break because it’s just a suit and goes in the hanger closet. So I shoved my suit in to small bag because I didn’t want to pay for such inhumane thing. Even the FA’s at the gate seemed rude. This is the last time I’m flying United airlines. Never again. Very disappointed.",-1
2018-10-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Denver,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,No room for carry on luggage,False,  No room for carry on luggage was very inconvenient! We were not even the last group to board and they forced everyone to check the rest of their carry on luggage without letting any of us use the space under the seats in front of us to store necessities. I only had one carry on item as did my husband and was not permitted to attempt to fit it on the plane. When we got on the plane it was probably over 100 degrees and miserable. I saw plenty of room under the seat in front of me for my bag. I was reduced to carrying around my necessary medications and items in a trash bag so I wouldn’t lose anything. Very disappointed with this experience. Step it up United. I think incentive should have been offered from the beginning to those willing to check bags in order to not have this issue if it is known that your plane cannot accommodate the permitted carry on items or that people should be required to only store one item in overhead and one under the seat. Fix the problem.,-1
2018-10-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,poor customer service,True,"  San Francisco to Honolulu. As I was checking in a bag I arrived 3.5 hours before my departure time which was 2.05pm from San Francisco to Honolulu. We were then delayed 2 hours because the WiFi didn’t work. We had to sit on the plane whilst this was being fixed. Then we got onto the runway and a passenger in the seat behind me noticed a panel on the left wing was flapping, the air hostess said she’d check it out with the captain and then she came back and said ‘this isn’t right, the captain has said he needs to check it out’ - we were on the runway how did this not flag up before! This fault then left us delayed 1 hour, then 2, then 3 all the way through until 1.40am in the morning. I was offered a full refund - to which I wanted to take - but I was told that there was no way my checked bag would be leaving the aircraft so it’d be flying to Honolulu without me. This was the start of my travels so that bag had all my possessions in, including my medication! I was told I would not be able to retrieve my medication or bag! I explained to them that I wanted the refund as the delays were beyond a joke, to the extent that one of the managers from United airlines said ‘this has never happened to United airlines’. In the end we took off at 2am, I felt very forced to stay on the flight and I was told I would be compensated. The customer care team offered me a measly $150 e-ticket for another united airline flight - i explained how I am from England so I wouldn’t be able to use it. And in any case $150 wouldn’t get me far! I asked for the cash refund that I was originally offered hoping that someone in the customer care team would understand my frustration - but no they didn’t care at all. The e-ticket offered is laughable - my flight cost £270 which equates to about $350 so this $150 offered is a joke. Shame on you United Airlines , poor communication and poor customer service.",-1

The gate attendant told passengers that purses were considered a personal item and that my carry on luggage needed to be checked. That has never happened to me before and I fly frequently on United from Denver to Chicago all the time. I got on the airline and asked the flight attendants if they changed something and told them what happened and they both stated that is was “personal preference to the gate attendants” as to what items can be brought on or not. I would think it would have to be based on the airplane itself? She was very rude and it should be a uniformed response.,1
2018-10-02,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Houston via New Orleans,3.0,,3.0,,,2.0,2,making our life miserable,True,"  Sao Paulo to Houston via New Orleans. United Airlines has the worst customer support in regards to missing baggage. My wife has been told for the past week that another passenger retrieved her luggage from the terminal carousel and that this passenger would likely have to return her bag in order to retrieve the proper bag since it was the only one left. We were told this for nearly a week. Then today we find out that the next day from the initial missing date, that passenger sent his brother to retrieve the luggage. Best part, luggage was given with first securing my wife's bag. This guest claims his brother did not grab any other luggage. We are told this a week later when prior to today we were told that we were waiting for this guest to return the luggage. This is beyond unacceptable. We were given no update that this had occurred until a week later! Their solution: file a police report so they can ""process"" the claim and access camera footage. This is unacceptable. My wife had priceless sentimental items from her family in Brazil that she will never get back. Thanks United your outsourced customer service was so helpful in making our life miserable for a week before we found out the truth.",-1

I spent a lot of time planning my trip down to see my mom, who has terminal cancer, only to find out the day before that my flight is cancelled. I had to reschedule for two week out, and lost my deposit on my hotel because of the short notice. Now, I have to wait two weeks more to see my mom, when she could pass at any time, and shell out even more money for a hotel. Not cool, United.",-1
2018-10-01,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Phoenix,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,Not worth the money I’ve saved,True," Every time I have flown United in the last four months (5 separate flights) the plane has been delayed. This last time, it was delayed 2 hours leaving and coming back we were stuck on the ground right outside our gate for 35 minutes. I understand that often there are issues outside their control, but it seems unlikely that 5 times within the past four months was all out of their control. When there are problems they are not transparent and give very little information about what you can expect going forward. Up until now I have been flying them because they have had the best prices, but I would much rather pay more and not have to deal with this as often. And if this does happen with other airlines, I am always given more information. Not worth the money I’ve saved.",-1

Worst airline I’ve ever dealt with, we were delayed an hr and a half. Rushed through customs ran all the way to the gate showed up 15 minuets before departing and where denied boarding. Costumer service refused to help us with 3 little kids left us with 3 little kids to sleep in airport with no vouchers or any help, and they lost are check in bags. I fly all over the country for work and have never had any airline treat customers so poorly. It’s sad they are allowed to stay in business. All I can say is never fly United they don’t care for the people who keep them in business.",-1
2018-09-30,0.6,Business,Business Class,Munich to Washington,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3,not comfy for Biz Class,True," Munich to Washington. Reviewing United is not really easy. It is a huge airline and it is just not fair to judge them by just one experience. Fortunately I flew United in a couple of opportunities so I am able to provide a couple of reviews. In this one it is about Biz Class on an ""old"" B777. Well it is just one D Experience. Having a Biz Class with 2-4-2 configuration is just not serious. Seat too tight to sleep. Plane is quite old. Too many passengers for a crew that is however very nice. Food is decent. Entertainment is very good. Overall not very comfy for Biz Class flight. Look for B787 Dreamliner Review for a better customer experience.",1
2018-09-29,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to San Francisco,2.0,2.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,they delayed the flight again,True,"  Seattle to San Francisco. This is my second time flying with United this month. My first flight 2 weeks ago from San Diego to Seattle was delayed because of ""traffic control "" delayed at the airport waiting area and then once we finally were able to board the airplane they delayed the flight again. Lost of people were on connecting flights and they did not offer nothing more than to wait at the airport. Luckily on that one I didn't have a connecting flight. Now here I am again flying with United because who would of think their ""traffic control"" is a regular issue for them often. Again flight is delayed and this time I have a connecting flight that I might not make it on time. Their solution, ""there is a possibility the other plane will wait for the passengers connecting to that flight"" well my departure time for my second flight is 10:10 and I am arriving for my connecting flight at 9:58am. Unless I fly (not in the plane, like literally) I dont see myself making it to the flight. So I will be in stand by until God knows I will make it to my final destination.",-1

No Wi-fi was available! Flight attendants were only able to serve half of the plane the complimentary drinks. Incredibly uncomfortable and there's no leg room. Also the flight attendants were absolutely rude. I will never fly United again!,-1

2018-09-25,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Vancouver via San Francisco,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Very disappointed by United,True," Very disappointed by United. Their online booking system didn't process our reservation correctly even though I received a confirmation email for my purchase. They never acknowledged that their system was faulty and blamed it on my bank 2 hours before boarding. The bank confirmed that the transaction went through and still United told me there was nothing they could do about it. I then bought a new ticket in front of them and the same problem persisted. Again they blamed it on my bank. Long story short the customer service is completely clueless, they treat you like you a nuisance and won't even apologize for their mistake or for wasting your time. Highly not recommended.",-1
2018-09-24,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Los Angeles via Newark,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2,very disappointing experience,True,"  Mumbai to Los Angeles via Newark. Both segments had B777-200, but with different configurations and vastly different travel experiences. The B777-200 from BOM to EWR had 3-3-3 configuration with an old seat-back TV screen. The 31 inch seat pitch was inadequate for a 15 hour flight. The one advantage that United has over Air India on BOM-EWR route is WiFi. Unfortunately, the WiFi was not working, and United compensated me with 2,500 bonus miles. The food selection was average, and the timing of meals was puzzling. Instead of serving dessert after dinner, the flight attendants distributed sandwich and Kit-Kat bar. The B777-200 on EWR-LAX route was in 3-4-3 configuration and had no seat-back TV screen. The seats on this B777 were much slimmer. There was no complimentary meal service on this 5.5 hour flight. Overall, a very disappointing experience.",-1

Late boarding because incoming flight was late. Boarding stopped mid-way through due to thunderstorm, which never materialized. Delayed disembarking in Chicago because bridge was not working. No snacks because they forgot to board them in Houston. Missed connection as a result. Re-routed to Charlotte. Departing gate was as far from my arriving gate as possible, which seems odd since it was the same airline. Most of the staff were on the rude side. Gate for Charlotte trip got changed. No drinks because route was too bumpy. Arrived in Charlotte, sat on tarmac for 10 minutes. Just received email that 1 of my 2 bags didn’t make it to Charlotte. Might be ok, though, because I only checked in one bag! Overall, not a pleasant experience. Wasn’t really treated like a customer (despite all the printed propaganda surrounding me telling me otherwise). Not sure how they stay in business unless they are all like this, in which case I’m glad I don’t fly that often.",-1

Flight left Bismarck late because ticket agent was hand keying the tickets, so we missed our connecting flight. Instead of a 45. Min layover it turned into a 5 hour layover. Then our luggage isn’t in Virginia when we land. Still don’t know when our bags will be here. Do Not Fly United! The most unorganized worthless airline I’ve ever flown!

Me and my family missed our flight due to the chaotic and confusing directions not given, but rudely yelled from staff while entering customs. Everyone in customs was confused, the staff was very unfriendly, yelling directions and arguing with people who did not know where to go or what to do making me sympathize with foreigners entering this country for the first time and receiving this type of hospitality. When I approached several different counters in the gating sections to ask for help, several desk employees walked passed me multiple times, with knowledge I was there for help as they were more interested in conversing amongst themselves or being on their phone. This was a terrible experience as the staff alone are all incompetent, rude, and very unhelpful. I refuse to fly with United ever again.",-1

At the beginning, we boarded the plane and waited for 3 hours for differents reasons until they told us that the plane had a problem so we had to get off. Each hour since 5pm they called at the microphone a “little” delay of 20-30 minutes and by now, I heard those “apologies” and excuses too many times. It’s midnight and we aren’t sure that the pilot will make it for 2am. It’s definitely my worst airline experience by far and I won’t ever fly again with United Airlines for sure!",-1

Despite over fifteen open seats in the middle of the aircraft, passengers were not allowed to move unless they paid a ridiculous up charge.

Attendant was rude and lied about why I couldn’t bring my small bag on because it had wheels. First he said it was an FAA regulation, then he tried to tell me it was a weight and balance issue, both false. I carried the same bag onto the same plane CRJ-200, 3 times in the last 4 days. It wasn’t until this last leg home that I ran into a problem! It would have also fit under me seat, but he wouldn’t budge! If they are flying under United, all regional carriers should follow the same rules! What a pain!",-1
2018-09-19,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Tucson via Houston,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,not a good experience,True," Before we booked our trip, we called the 800 customer service number to inquire if United offered discounts for retired military for baggage. We were told twice that two bags can be discounted (free) and show proper ID at ticket counter. When we were arrived, two staff members said that United did not offer free baggage and we had to pay $50 for two bags. We budgeted this trip and chose United because we didn’t think we had to pay for baggage so this was very upsetting. Then, our flight was delayed in TPA due to a flight attendant having the wrong schedule. It was announced they were trying to find a different employee but were unsuccessful. Then it was announced that we were delayed due to federal law of not enough time between flights for staff so that’s why they had to find a different staff member. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6:55 and we finally left at 7:40. We asked about our connecting flight in IAH and the gate employee said oh you’ll be fine, but don’t stop on your way to the gate. We had to walk very fast from terminal C to E and arrived at last call for boarding. This made this trip quite stressful instead of relaxing as what a vacation is supposed to be. To be continued for the trip back home, not a good experience either. Won’t be traveling United any time soon.",-1

The flight was basically empty I had no one else sit on the entire row with me and they would not let me bring both my book bag and suit on as an item under the seat. They started I had to pay 25$ and it had to be checked in as cargo because the flight was ""full"" and there was no space - all they care about is making an extra buck and not their customer service.

Save yourself from hidden fees and humilitation: Never fly United. I think it’s no coincidence that all the airline horror stories I and everyone I know have have been with United. Their staff make up crazy rules about baggage - even small bags and backpacks - in order to secretly charge you more money, and I say sometimes because sometimes they tell you these rules and sometimes they don’t, every single staff member apparently has a different set of them. I have witnessed how they make their customers disassemble electronic-quipped bags in front of the boarding door, or made me stuff a cumbersome item into my backpack (to try make me pay for it) when later I was told it’s perfectly fine for it to be in my travel bag. Long story short, never fly United, and please tell your friends not to as well. You will be much better off paying $20 more for an airline that will not charge you hidden fees and not humiliate you. United is a terrible company.",-1

Scheduled our fights 5 months in advance. They keep changing the times, the dates and now telling us we may have to stay overnight, due to their issues in refueling in San Francisco. They changed our departure by 2 hours and 20 minutes. Then they tried moving us back to coach, when we paid for upgrades seats. We get to the airport in Maui to be told our departure is going to be delayed even longer and they can not guarantee we will make our connecting flight in San Francisco to Atlanta.

We boarded at 7:30 pm everything seem to be ok and we were on the run off ready to take off when he captain announced the plane has to returned to the gate due some mechanical problem, we were repeatedly asked to stay on the plane. After almost 4+ (11:30 pm) hours we were told the plane was fixed and that we would be taking off. 30 minutes later we were told they didn't have any flight attendants because they have to check out due “long hours” and if we waited a few minutes the replacement flight attendants were in the airport and on their way. After another hour of waiting we were told they couldn't get flight attendants and deboarded the plane. I was in lne trying to get in to the earliest flight posible and ask for arrangements to sleep since it was almost 1:40am airline personel where rude, refuse to make areangements to reroute baggage to my flight because there was nobody to do it at that time... they also told me as a local i was not entitle to accomodations they asked me to go home and return at 4am to board my new flight for the rest they keep telling people not to stand in line. United was completely unprepared, how could they not know if the repair took longer than 2 hours their flight attendants would time out. How did they not already have a back-up plan in case the repair took longer than 2 hours. they had plenty time to Make arrangements to help passanger they left stranded althdought they wait until last minute when everybody in the airport was gone, i even findout the flight was delayed until next morning by checking online before they announced it. Customer service is unexistant... even over the phone people lied to me with different stories and promises they knew they were lies, my luggage arrived late at my destination dispite several employees assuring me it was going to be on my new flight... on top of experience rude employee in IAH the phone personel are useless and several hung up on me.. nobody care how much they abuse passangers. Several of the United staff were clearly upset and they just stopped helping people and when I finally got to the front I was treated poorly. Every single employee i talked to redirected me to either complain online or file a form that could “possibly award me a compensation” within 10 business day after the incident.

Missed my morning meetings and basically got told by United Airlines Management to screw myself. I can assure you I was of no concern to that flight and will never ever again waste valuable money flying your airline. I wish I had the exact names of the individuals so someone who knows how to operate business at United could try and help solve their desperate need for people who don’t have massive power-trips by use of authority they have zero of.

Everyone was telling us something different and we could not get a solution for anything. We had a flight going from Los Angeles to Denver from there to our final designation which was Columbus. Our flight was delayed due to mechanical issues four and half hours which we would miss our other flight. There were two flights with Delta airline that would get us there on schedule but no one was willing to help and made us wait 2 hours so then we couldn’t make that flight. Now we are having to take an overnight flight which we did not want and we get nothing in return for this crisis. We even have to pay another baggage fee because we got transferred to a different airline. I would never fly this airline again in my life nor recommend this airline to anyone I know.,-1

After waiting more than an hour they asked everyone to get in line, then they ran out of hotel vouchers so had to sleep on the floor. United was completely unprepared, how could they not know if the repair took longer than 2 hours their flight attendants would time out. How did they not already have a back-up plan in case the repair took longer than 2 hours. I was second in line when they asked us not to be in line, why would they announce for us to get out of line and then tell us we have to get back in line and then tell most people, sorry there's no hotel. Several of the United staff were clearly upset and they just stopped helping people and when I finally got to the front I was treated poorly. I was asked why am I here and when I told them about the flight delay they said they didn't know anything about it and that they had just got there. I asked for my hotel voucher and they had to check to see if they could help me. I received a hotel voucher and by the time I got to the hotel there was enough time for 2 hours of sleep. United did a terrible job of managing the situation.",-1

Where do I begin, I can’t even find anything positive to say! The worst airlines ever everything was bad. Very uncomfortable seats and extremely rude staff. You can’t even ask them a simple question they literally just yell at you and don’t even use manners. I’d never fly with United ever again.",-1
2018-09-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Edinburgh to Charleston via Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,the plane was filthy,True,"  Edinburgh to Charleston via Washington. The flights to Edinburgh were ok but the planes we were on were very old and filthy. I used the warm towel they provide before the meal service to wipe off the center console between the seats and it was black. Yuck! The flight attendants were nice and the food was fine. Our return flights were not good. Our transatlantic flight was cancelled but we were not notified until we were standing in line to check in. We got a nice hotel room amd meals and the flight the next day was on time. But again the plane was filthy, the blanket smelled like body odor and had holes in it, and the wool throw smelled like a wet dog. There is no way those had been cleaned between uses. Again the center console was visibly dirty. I paid almost $5000 for this? The flight attendants were unfriendly and we were made to feel that we were an inconvenience for them. Our connection was in Newark and the plane we were supposed to leave on was diverted to another airport. Flight was delayed for hours while we waited for another plane. That one was United Express and that plane was very old and the interior was not maintained. My husband wents to the lavatory at the back of the plane and said there was a crack in the interior plastic. Part of my armrest was missing. I have to wonder what the state of the mechanics on these aged planes is like if the interior that is visible to the customers is so bad. I will avoid United Airlines whenever possible in the future. Think twice before you book with them.",-1
2018-09-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Charlotte via Amsterdam / Chicago,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,"Very, very unhappy",True,"  Lufthansa/United failed to put my luggage on the airplane in Munich, for some unknown reason. Despite filing a claim, my luggage was still sitting in Munich three days later. Eventually, they flew it to Charlotte, NC where I had stayed one night upon my arrival before traveling onwards. I called every night to track the progress (or lack thereof) of my luggage. Even though I had updated the address from the address of the first night's hotel to the new location, every single time I called they had the address of the first night's hotel. Three days after my luggage arrived in Charlotte, I called for the 7th time because I still did not have my bag. They told me it had been dumped off at the hotel where I had stayed 5 nights before, despite the fact that I'd updated the address over and over. So now my luggage is at some hotel I stayed at 5 nights ago that I am not planning to return to. After an hour on the phone with United this evening, he's told me (for the 5th day in a row) that I should have my bag by tomorrow. United is incompetent. Over and over I heard them say, ""I apologize for that, ma'am."" It would seem that they've all be trained to deal with issues in this way, rather than by actually sorting them out. Very, very unhappy with United/Lufthansa and not fly with them again, even if it means paying extra to fly on another airline.",-1
2018-09-11,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Philadelphia,2.0,,4.0,,,5.0,2,should look for alternatives,True,"  Denver to Philadelphia. The plane was delayed because of a warning light about a fuel pump after the flight was fully loaded. It then took 20 minutes to get a mechanic and another 20 minutes to figure out the warning didn't matter and we could fly anyway. ""its a redundant system"", they told us. The experience was made worse by the fact that there was no air conditioning during the period of the delay on a hot day in Denver. The airplane was not cleaned after arrival in Denver from San Francisco. I was stepping on crackers left on the floor and there was garbage left in the compartment on the back of the seat. My family flies UA regularly but this had me thinking I should look for alternatives now whenever I can.",-1

I traveled alone with my 10 month old daughter both ways. No flight attendant helped me out in any way like putting luggage up in the cabin, picking up her toys for me, or even just being friendly. Everyone treated me like I was a hassle to deal with. One attendant refused to give me my bassinet because service had started, even though I had already been waiting for an hour. It only takes a few seconds to latch it on. One flight attendant actually made eye contact with my smiley daughter and waved, which was nice. One Japanese male attendant who I spoke to in Japanese, replied to me in English even though (he was speaking Japanese to the other staff so) I know he spoke Japanese. Why not speak back to me in Japanese? That is just plain rude. Other than that, after experiencing JAL last year, I thought the food was extremely disappointing. I also specifically made a phone call just to request a bassinet, but when I went to check in, there was no such request. I was baffled. I can’t say how disappointed and annoyed I was about the staff on both flights. If you are traveling alone with an infant, they will treat you like an inconvenience.",-1

2018-09-10,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Jacksonville,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,delayed further and further,True,"  After arriving at the airport at 4:30am in San Diego we flew into Chicago. Little did we know we would not be leaving that airport for 36 hours. Our flight to our destination was scheduled to leave at 6pm. After our gate got changed 10 times and our flight got delayed further and further we scurried up and down stairs to each one. We then arrived at the last gate at 9:30pm. We sat and sat and were told no updates. We then were told we were waiting on the plane to arrive that we were flying out. The plane landed. BUT we only have one pilot, so we waited for another plane to land for a second pilot. Thenone of the flight attendants timed out on her shift and could no longer board our flight home. BUT by the time the other plane landed the staff timed out as we watched them walk right out of the gangway to the plane passed us never to be seen again. So, we waited on another plane for a whole new crew. We were assured for the first announcement over the intercom of the night that we were heading out soon! At this point it is 11:30pm. 30 minutes later, at 12am, we are notified that the flight is cancelled. after waiting 9 hours and running around the airport, it is canceled. This is not even the worst of it. We call United customer service to see what can be done 2 times (go ahead and listen to those calls- they are pathetic) only to be told there are no more flights to JAX and that we cannot be helped.  The couple in front of us got another flight booked automatically that left 6am the next day why our customer service experience was so different is beyond me. We ended up buying the only flight we could in a different airport. We ended up purchasing a flight from MDW in Chicago to JAX. Sometime after purchasing the flight I was so relieved to find one! That is until I realized the flight I purchased from Delta airlines was on September 27th when I need to leave ORD right then and there on now what is September fourth. So with even more stress added, I am out over $500 more dollars, I still have no way home, I have nowhere to stay no way to travel, I don’t have my luggage, I am defeated. So, after searching for some more time, there are no flights out of ORD to JAX for 2 more days. I ended up purchasing another flight for $935.60 from a different airline and airport in Chicago that did not leave until 1 pm the next day. We were left with no other choice but the sleep on the ground. So, it is now 1:30am. We are wondering where is my luggage that has everything I need in it and were told our luggage went to JAX already without us. It didn’t make sense. So, we then stood in another line and were told that our luggage is at ORD but if we exit to get it, we cannot get back in until the morning. So, we agreed to get our luggage in the morning before we spend another $40+ dollars to transfer to MDW where our new flight is.",-1

First delayed flight due to weather, then after boarding there was a plane “malfunction” meaning we would miss our connecting flight. Couldn’t get us anything until the following night missing a day and a half of our trip! Then when trying to see if we could get a partial vs full refund depending if we canceled our trip vs still going they said those seats for the next day were now gone! Forget it what a joke! They were so quick to take my money but didn’t refund me for a checked bag I didn’t even take because of the cancelled trip. Phone customer service was just as terrible saying I had to fill out online for a refund when I told them it kept coming up with an error, sounds like lazy workers to me! Will not fly again!",-1

Never flying United again. If a representative is taking pain to go through the reviews (which I highly doubt), it’s high time to change your employees. What angered me was not the delays or inconveniences of last minute gate/terminal changes. That I can handle. What irked me was the sheer arrogance and attitude that each one of your employees show towards customers in general-especially the ones at Chicago O’Hare. I am yet to come across one who is civil and decent enough. As customers, we shouldn’t have to deal with your employees attitude and sarcasm. I give this airline zero stars.

United cancelled my flight to give the seats to another group that was cancelled the day. Before then delayed my flight and cost me two whole days in an airport and 2 missed days of work . They offered a laughable 150 compensation to fly with them again. Please read before booking. They are over priced and have no one to speak to in customer service only emails and no phone calls or conversations. I will never fly them again and I suggest you do the same,-1
2018-09-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Raleigh Durham,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United Airlines customer review,True,"  Newark to Raleigh Durham. Flying United once again was a horrible experience. Even though a passing storm stopped several hours before the departure the outbound flight was cancelled. I had to go to a university to attend classes for one week and when I checked in on the rescheduled flight, the flight attendant made me check my luggage even though my luggage basically met the carry on requirement, which caused me to be late to my class though my rescheduled flight left at 6am and I had plenty of time to get to class by 9am. One the way back my flight was delayed 4 hours though only a 1.5 hour flight. Once I got back to my airport, because they made me check my luggage again, I was delayed another hour since the luggage were put into a room without alerting anyone. United airline operates giving zero consideration to the customer's time, paying good money. Their attitude seems to be """"we are doing you a favor"""". The attendants are rude and I have never flown out on time nor reached my destination on time. United new carry on baggage policy is a scam. You have to board basically with nothing with you unless of course you pay more. It is a shame how United treat their customers so poorly and without much dignity.",-1

It wasn't enough for United Airlines to make your life hell on the plane, they've overachieved and ruined your day before you even check in! I got to the gate to check in and immediately was informed I was restricted. Yeah thanks for alarming me. Then I'm notified my flight was delayed, but received no notification that this happened. Great, now I'm at the airport 4 hours early. But then it gets worse. I researched the night before and United states you are allowed a personal item and a carry on (sizes are listed) but they don't mention that it depends on the class. If you have basic economy you forgo your free carryon rights and must pay to check it in. Now they've put a damper on my day, trip and wallet. Then my flight was delayed 2 more times just to really kick me in the knees. Bottom line, I would much rather give my nonprofit salary to any other airline.",-1
2018-09-08,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Medford,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,2,so rude to customers,True,"  San Francisco to Medford . The flight was fine but we paid a lot of money and still had to pay more for baggage and to go on an earlier flight. We also paid to get premium economy so as to have a bit of leg room. The airline check-in was a nightmare. We were coming in from overseas on a different airline and had to re-check bags and get seats. There were kiosks, which I assumed were for checking in bags only. We wanted to try to get an earlier flight so I started to approach the “additional services” counter. However, the attendants started yelling that the counter was only for missed flights. The whole time we were there, the people at the counter were yelling at everyone to use the kiosk. There was no-one there welcoming us and answering questions, they assumed that we should know their process and yelled when we didn’t. After being in the UK and experiencing the polite service there, it was disappointing that one of our major airlines is so rude to customers. Frankly, I would rather fly Southwest where they will be polite to me and won’t “nickle and dime” me like United. Unfortunately, few airlines fly in/out of our little airport.",-1

Horrible delays today without explanation from Wichita to San Francisco. Flight UA2188 from Wichita supposed to fly out at 6:25am, 4 hour unexplained delay. Missed connection in Denver. Flight changed to UA0733 that was also delayed 2 hours unexplained then canceled for flight UA3436 back to Kansas City at 3pm for connecting flight UA5312 to San Francisco which has now been delayed as well. Wide spectrum delays on United flights as a rule, come to find out, especially on the planes from Canada. The planes are old and in disrepair. I will have been bounced around 19 hours and missed a full day of work with expensive parking fees at San Francisco along with now ridiculous drive time. I will never fly United again and will not recommend them. I spoke with another passenger that stated they've been trying to get home for 3 days with United.",-1

2018-09-05,0.7,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Newark,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,Very friendly staff,True,"  Paris to Newark. Very friendly staff (except one FA who was a bit cranky, but her colleagues more than made up for it). The food and beverages in business were good. The salads served for lunch and then for the pre-landing snack were fresh and tasty and the pre-arrival snack is a big improvement over the microwaved chicken or mystery meat wrap they used to serve. The seats on the 767-400 are still the old CO/UA BusinessFirst seats. Not bad, but not as comfortable as the new Polaris seats - which at this point you'd start to expect on NYC-western Europe flights, given what the non-US carrier competition now offers. However, we had plenty of pillows and blankets, including a cool gel pillow that was really comfortable. Star Alliance lounge at CDG isn't anything to write home about, but it was fine. The new United Polaris lounge the we used on our outbound flight is a huge improvement over the old United Club.",1

As I approached the service at the gate they ignored me for about 2 minutes and then told me rudely that they are not open yet.

Just finishing off a 2nd leg of a flight. The first leg from New York (LGA) to Houston (IAH) was an incredible 1st class flight with outstanding service. However, my connection from IAH to Lubbock, TX (LBB) was miserable. One would think that a tiny plane at 60% capacity with NO first class section would allow some flexibility, but apparently that’s not the case with UA. I ended up next to another 6’5 male in an already ultra-tight seating arrange (reason #1 I don’t fly United). I quickly felt like the ultimate “commoner” no longer in 1st class when asking to change seats to one of the 3 bulkhead seats with no passenger after the main doors were closed. “Sorry sir, only Gold and Platinum flyers are allowed” is not a comforting feeling after I just spent $1165 on a last minute first class ticket!! If that’s a company policy change it! That’s classless United Airlines. I didn’t request a first class seat. I requested a poor bulkhead with the tightest legroom of any carrier I’ve flown. I think the seat would have cost me $18, but it originally wasn’t available.",-1

I’m appalled by the horrible attitude from the ground staff in SFO. I was one of the last few to board (with 25 minutes to spare before takeoff), and was told that there was insufficient space overhead bin for the remaining passengers’ bags. I was asked: “Will your bag fit in front of you?” by one of the male staff, to which I answered “Yes, it’s just clothes.” I was then yelled at for no good reason. He said “I didn’t ask you what was in the bag, I asked if it would fit.” I’ve never been treated like this by service crew anywhere in the world.

I travel on a regular basis, but not normally on United, Now I understand why! The gate agents, flight attendants and baggage workers are some of the rudist people I've ever met. They seem extremely incompetent and give you the run around if you have a question. I lost my wallet on a plane and it took me over an hour to find someone who could help me. I finally went back to the airport, which was a $60 Uber ride away to figure it out on my own. In addition, my husband was checking a firearm and it literally took 30 minutes to complete after being sent to several different places by several different people. I booked in economy because I didn't read the fine print that talked about the inflexibility of this type of fare. When we inquired about changing, they treated us like we were second hand citizens. Its not like the ticket was free, even if it was, that's no way to treat anyone. Finally, there was a child screaming at the top of his lungs on our flight and not one attendant offered any help to the mother. In addition, they didn't even insist that either of them put on their seatbelts. Unbelievable! Things look pretty in the terminal and everyone is dressed very well, however, the customer service is horrible.",-1
2018-09-03,0.6,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Denver,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2,what you call plain mediocre,False," I flew on a flight from Tokyo, Narita to Denver international, coming back from a family vacation. Our flight was a total of 10 hours and 10 hours and 20 minutes long. Departing time was 5:15pm - 12:35pm. The flight price was $1,394. I gave it a average of 7 stars, based on the overall stars of 21. I feel the value for money was not where you want it to be. The flight was bearable, but not extremely comforting, there were times where I had to really get creative in the position of my body to get at least 20 minutes of sleep. Leg room was mediocre at best. A passenger sitting next to me who was a little over six foot had 0 space between his knees and the seat in front, he sometimes had to press his foot against the seat in front. Seat Comfort = 2/5 - Value For Money = 2/5 In terms of the cabin crew, they were not nice, but they were not rude either. You could tell some flight attendants were a bit rough around the edges, wanted things to be done quickly. But some were more understanding and nice, but still have that edginess. That is all okay because they ended giving out some decent food. The problem I have with some airlines is that the food is just bland, and this is the same with United, but thankfully, they came with salt and pepper, good job. Dinner meals were okay, but breakfast was great. If your settling in for a long flight, try the omelette meal if they have it, the meal is rather delicious for airplane food. Cabin Staff Crew = 3/5 - Food And Beverages = 4/5. One thing I desperately have to mention is the washrooms in that airplane. I mean I had never seen anything like it. If your a person that frequently visits the washrooms, and does not like to wait, United might not be for you. On my flight, there was not a minute that the washroom was empty. There was also somebody in it, and there was also a lot of waiting, you couldn’t just sit at your seat and wait for someone to finish, because they’re people in line that will snatch that’s opportunity up right away. Man the washrooms on that flight were something I will never forget. My last topic is in-flight entertainment. I felt the roster of movies was pretty good, and I got to watch some very good movies, that are brand new. The only downside is the technology to watch it. It was a touchscreen tv on the seat, but to be honest it was challenging to use, a light press on the screen when you want to exit out will not work at all, and you might be stuck with thinking that your screen isn’t working and not watch a movie for the whole flight! But instead you had to press hard on every single button to get it to work. This is okay and is a lot better than the screen not working at all, but is frustrating. In-Flight Enternainment = 3/5 Well the flight was bearable, an above average flight as you can say, and above average is okay with me on a gruelling 10 hour flight but anything below that is a nightmare. Overall this flight was what you call plain mediocre. And if you have a bit of patience you’ll get though it fine, and if you don’t find another flight. Bearable, Above Average and Mediocre, are things that I feel itchy about, but for a 10 hour flight I would recommend it, but the price is a little bit out of hand.",1

First let me start by saying if United is your only option for an airline you may want to strongly consider driving to your destination, you will likely get there quicker. Second when your flight is canceled 90 minutes before departure because the aircraft is “not available” United will never tell you why, so do not ever expect any type of compensation for your loss of time or other expenses. Lastly, not only will you ever hear and apology, but instead the agents are rude and act like they are doing you a favor for rebooking causing you to lose an entire day of your time. Never again my friends, and yes please do use my real name! I rarely ever leave poor reviews but this is more than justified!",-1

Worst airline in the world is United Airlines. I'm a gold member for many years. The airlines constantly has flight delay, extremely bad or worst customer services - bad attitude of gate agent, attendants, and all known to everyone the worst food services among all the airlines I've experienced. I fly often with European and Asian airlines, even latin american airlines, all I have received much better services than from United. This is the latest experience I had just 2 days ago traveling from SFO to Reykjavik connecting at Frankfurt. Notified in the morning of departure, flight was delayed for 1 hour 15 min. I have 1 hour 35min connection at Frankfurt originally. Got to airport, the check-in agent said the flight should take off per new time and will arrive only 30min than original. It turned out flight was late departure for 2 hour 15min, and arrived 1 hour 10 min later than planned. And got text message at FRA saying they put me on the flight next day midnight arrival to Iceland. That is 1 and half day later. I only going to be at Iceland for 3 days. Then to make things worse, they couldn't get my baggage transfer to the new flight that I had switched to at FRA airport. Now I'm stuck at Iceland without any clothes and can't get out in the cold weather. Here is the contrast, at the SFO airport, a gate agent of United, at the elite / premium line, was extremely rude. I hand over my passport and he handed back and said ""open to the photo page"". With 1 hour delay, and line up, and even at the premium line, this is United's attitude. And to compare to the agent of Lufthansa airlines at FRA airport gate, the 2 ladies was very friendly, and went out of their ways to help me, and put me on a same day flight connecting to Iceland only 5 hour later than my original flight. They didn't send me to the United customer service, which is what I would expect any gate agent or airline services in US airports would do. They made many phone calls while asking me to wait and took care of everything and handed over my new boarding pass and told me they've notified baggage handling of my new flights.",-1

Found out our flight was over an hour delayed after arriving at the airport, however we needed to ask if this meant we would miss our connecting flight. Staff was completely unsympathetic. Gave us 2 options both would have us arrive at our destination a little less than 24 hours after our scheduled time. On top of that, the attendant was unsure if we would get a refund if we cancelled the flight. Again, completely unsympathetic. It’s 2018 United, try and figure out a better flying schedule so your flights don’t get delayed. In the future, I would happily spend extra money if this means I will not ever have to fly on United again.",-1

On July 22, 2018, I registered for the United MileagePlus Reinstate Challenge. It was my understanding that if I took a qualifying flight, then I'd reinstate 90,000 miles. However, after I took my qualifying flight, United told me that only 1,500 miles were reinstated. Given that they charged my $100, I asked for a refund since it was not worth paying $100 for $1,500 miles, but they refused. Their reinstatement challenge is a fraud so don't register for the program!",-1

Worst return travel that never happened just because they were not able to match first name from a boarding pass to the name given on the passport. Instead of checking the surname on both the travelling documents and providing every possible proof that it was a booked by a family member who gave my Arabic initial instead of my actual first name. Every personal detail I entered and gave them such as passport no. DOB, Expiration date and ticket details all matched, but they still didn't let me go through. I'm baffled and wondering as to why didn't United rectified my ticket when I have given them my passport details and all. They took me to the TSA and adding salt to my injury, they kept me waiting for an hour, took me back to United Airlines and asked me to verify her details which the customer service on the phone did, but the United Airlines rep on the desk at the airport refused to verify it. The customer rep on the phone spoke to the rep at the desk and he still refused me to travel back. They have sucked the money out of me not only for the return ticket and $100 extra for an extra luggage I was supposed to take back to London today.",-1

They will try to suck money out of you in every possible way. They charged me extra $50 for 2 bags that were allowed free to carry on by all other 5 airlines in the itinerary. Also they insisted again and again that the “kind of ticket class” I booked, they are doing me a favor for everything. I am not sure how they treat economy passengers but it felt insulting at one point. It was unfortunate that I booked tickets through United Airlines. But I will not repeat this mistake again in future, it’s a lesson learned for me.",-1

Rochester New York to Washington. I was on a small plane (2 seats per side) and I being a large man was also sitting next to a large man (probably the two biggest guys on the plane). There were 3 of 4 exit row seats open. They wouldn’t let us move because they the flight attendant said we couldn’t because we didn’t pay for them. They were already paid for but they didn’t show up for the flight. So she decided to make it an uncomfortable flight for us and then leave the exit row seats open which is a hazard.",-1

My family and I were rerouted because we missed our connecting flight in Chicago when the first flight from Buffalo was almost two hours delayed. We were sent from Chicago to LaGuardia airport in New York and told that our luggage would be sent to LaGuardia. When we arrived at LaGuardia, our luggage didn't. We filed a baggage claim and were told that the luggage was still in Chicago but would arrive on a later flight. Since our connecting flight wouldn't be leaving until the next morning, we waited at the airport and when the last flight arrived around 11pm, still no luggage. We are now left without any luggage and we will be catching our cruise at it's next port of call. This means we will be without a change of clothes and toiletries during a one week cruise. United Airlines has only given us a lot of explanations why they can't help us. The only reason we will even be able to board the boat is because we purchased new tickets through another airline. After the humiliation and frustration that we have been put through by United Airlines, I would never recommend this airline. They give you a number to call but make sure that you can't contact a live person.",-1

Because of this we could not go to Kauai. We had a return flight from Kauai to Maui connecting from Maui to SFO. We had already paid for our flight, we called in to see if we would have to do anything special with our bags. Then they informed us because we wouldn't be on the first plane in the flight arrangement they would need to ""cancel"" per policy and charge us additionally to schedule us a new flight, even though we already paid for two seats on a flight that is already leaving from Maui to sf which we would be on. United had ""waived fees"" for flight issues related to the hurricane up until the 26th August, but had no sympathy or sensitivity to the fact that our issue is directly correlated to the waivers they were issuing. Terrible customer service, terrible policies, terrible compassion, and overall I am not surprised with this experience given everything United has received heat for in recent history. I'll never book with them again. I have to believe our experience is part of UA's attempt to fix their stock price, never again. This experience was over the phone and not directly related to any flight attendants, pilots, or in flight experience.

All staff members were unhelpful. Going home from Miami flight was delayed which caused us to be unable to make our second flight. They had no more flights until the next day and would not refund nor give us a hotel. So we will be missing work and lost a lot of money in Uber’s, hotel and food.

So now I need to get out of line and go back to speak with an agent. Then they tell me I have to pay for my bags to go through, $25 for the first bag and $35 for the second. And on the plane they stuck me in the last row. Where the people in front of me put their seat all the way back and my seat doesn't move! I paid as much as the person in front of me did, why did I get such a horrible seat? It wasnt fair for me to sit there all messed up, its ridiculous.On top of all of that, the plane is old, nothing is new.

2018-08-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Atlanta via Newark,3.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,the worst experience,True,"  This is the worst experience I ever had. I was flying from Boston MA to Atlanta Georgia via Newark with the flight scheduled 7:30 am with destination arrival 1:18 pm. The flight from the Boston was delayed for more than 5 hours due to thunder storm at Newark and the problem with generator failure at the gate which caused missing of connecting flight to Atlanta. After waiting in queue for 2 hrs at Newark, the boarding pass was issued for 5:40 pm that day(August 11th, Saturday). After the boarding was announced for 5:40 and the gate was opened for crew members, the plane was cancelled. There was already very long queue at consumer service there were no other options than standing in the queue because I was unable to reach customer service via phone. After waiting for line for more than four hours, the situation became very worse due to rude behavior of the customer service representative. She mentioned that next available flight is on Monday morning(August 13th) and there is nothing she can do to help. She also mentioned that hotel accommodation cannot be done as it is weather related although the flight delay from Boston was due to power failure at the gate as well. She convinced me to fly back to Boston next morning(Sunday) and forget about the family vacation or wait at airport until Monday morning. The representative walked away stating that she has other customer to take care of and asking me to make decision to wait until Monday or fly back to Boston on Sunday. It was already past 10 PM and my younger daughter(5yrs) was sleeping on my shoulder. The customer service representative did not came back to the window for more that half and hour and I walked to the next window and requested to talk to the manager. The guy at other window called their team leader who offered option for stand by tickets for next day and spend the night at the airport. I was already tired and hungry and there was no other option than crying or comforting wife and two kids. Spent cold night at cold airport floor. I was not able to get accommodated on 9 am flight on Sunday. I convinced my wife and two kids who where crying after loosing hope of getting flight. Next available flight for stand by was on 11:01 am. There was already about 60 people on standby list and I was flying in a family of four, so the hope of getting boarding pass was very minimum. But it was our luck to get boarding pass for 11:01 plane to Atlanta. I will never fly in United airlines until they review their policies about flight cancellation give education to their costurmer cervices representatives.",-1

Once we were in the air, we landed early in Detroit and United Airlines had no instructions. We were only told to get off the plane and wait for instruction. After an hour of waiting they came to a conclusion that there would be another flight the next day. United did not help with any accommodation for a place to sleep in the night for any of their customers. When I checked into a hotel that I was forced to pay for, other people staying at the hotel had vouchers from the Amarican Airlines company because American Airlines cares about where their customers go to sleep at night in the event of a flight change or delay. The day of the flight there was no representative seen at the desk gate D10 from the hours of 7am-10.30am. There was no one there to talk or help any customer until the time of boarding. I sent in a complaint online and a reply came to me saying my request would be answered in 14-22 days. The representatives I spoke to on the phone for United airlines helped with nothing.",-1

A six hour nightmare. The space for legs is ridiculously small. Even smaller than Ryanair or easyJet.

When I asked the customer service at the airport to provide lodging or compensation they replied ""we realize this may be our fault but we can't help you and can't provide lodging near by and won't go to the effort"". I asked him to document the conversation so I could follow up with customer service. He refused stating ""I can't document activities for interaction with customers"". Clearly he was poorly trained and was worried that his information was incorrect. Afterwards I followed up with customer service. I received an email stating that response time is 7-10 days. I received no response within the given time frame. When I responded I got another email stating the response time was now 14-21 days. Poor all around but par for the course for united.",-1

How my bag got to LaGuardia is beyond my comprehension because we were told at Pittsburgh that no flights were going in to LaGuardia. My bags are stuck in LaGuardia even though I have returned to Oregon! Every time I call to have them send the bags to me they say the same thing, ""Your bag is at LaGuardia.

One of the worst Customer service. I am scheduled to travel from Detroit to Chennai via Newark. My initial flight from Detroit was at 4:45 which was delayed and hence i was rescheduled in another flight at 5:50 pm. I boarded the flight on time, but United Airlines made me to sit inside the flight for 3 hours without taking off and took off at 8:30 pm to Newark, but they diverted to Washing DC and reached DC at 10:45 pm. I missed my connection from Newark which was scheduled to be 8:50 pm. When i landed in Washington DC, i contacted the United Representative who asked me to go Newark in the same flight which is going back to Newark and ask the Representative over there. So i have to wait to go to Newark to ask about my options. In the meantime, United didnt offer any food or water as it is 11 pm and none of the shops are open at DC and I didnt have any food after lunch. I boarded the flight in DC to Newark at 11:30 pm and again we were made to sit inside the airplane for another 2 hours before take off and reached Newark at 3:30 am (next day). I have to wait in line for 3 hours to speak to United Airline customer representative and took more than one hour to reschedule to another flight which i have to tell them what flights are available by looking from my personal phone. By the time i completed the process, it is 7:30 am and my reschedule flight is at 2:15 pm from Newark. I had 7 hours and United Airlines said wait in the airport to take the next flight which is through Air India. United never offered any accommodations or food and never ever thought about their customer. I waited in the airport and reached India the next day, but found out my bag didnt reach. When i contacted Air India which was the carrier which brought me to India, AirIndia mentioned that United Airlines never handed over the bags to them. Its been 2 days after i reach and yet to receive my bags and AirIndia told me United is yet to give the bags. Don't travel through United Airlines, as this is my second worst experience with United Airlines. Exactly three years ago, i flew through United from Washington DC to Frankfurt and United made to sit in the flight for 6 hours without taking off and asked us to get out of the flight after 6 hours of delay stating they have technical issues. At that time, i decided never to take United, but this time Lufthansa asked me to take United as part of their alliance as Lufthansa flight are booked for certain dates. I was assuming that United Airlines would have changed in the last three years and would be better. To my assumption, they have changed, but worse than the previous time. Atleast last time when the issue happened, United provided accommodations and food, but this time they didn't care about any of the customers and didn't even worry about anything about their customer. Please don't ever fly with United Airlines.",-1

Flight was supposed to leave at 7am. They had no plane at the gate because nobody could bring it to the gate. Once plane was loaded with passengers it taxied onto the runway. As it moved into the runway we heard high pitched squealing and thudding. After sitting there for quite a while pilot announced going back to terminal because the plane check he just did showed a problem. We sat on the plane in the heat until they told us it would be at least an hour. The staff never offered economy class passengers a drink but the business class passengers got all they wanted and snacks. Everyone sat on the plane on their phones trying to rebook because they only had one attendant helping people rebook. We searched flights and when we landed in Chicago was told by United personnel we couldn't take a flight going to Denver to connect to go to Bozeman (even though there was room for us) that would have gotten there hours earlier than 10pm. We had to change our car rental and hotel for Yellowstone. We asked to be able to go into the United Lounge but was told no unless we paid $59 per person. Instead United airlines is giving us a ""restaurant"" voucher good for McDonalds. We do a lot of flying and decided to try United again. Will never ever in our lifetime fly them again because their customer service and plane maintenance is awful. Their WiFi on the plane did not work once we were up in the air.",-1

2018-08-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Newark,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,arrogance and callousness,True,"  I was traveling with my family to London and was all set to comeback on Aug 9th. Out of the blue I got a text 3h before flight departure that my flight from LHR to EWR was canceled due to weather.  The weather could not have been more picure perfect in London and same was the case in EWR. Upon probing the customer care, they admitted that it was mechanical failure. The reason they say weather is that then they are off the hook. They could only find flight to fly the following day. Now I went from direct flight to connection through Frankfurt. I had to spend one additional day in hotel, food, clothing all purchased at my cost. Unfortunately, my flight next day was also delayed. The guys in Lufthansa said that my connection in Frankfurt was fine. I missed the connection. Now I contacted United. They said it was not their issue anymore and I have to deal with Lufthansa. Lufthansa put me now through Denmark. Fine print: My flight from Denmark to EWR was standby and Lufthansa said that it was confirmed. We go to Copenhagen to find this hard truth. Called United and as expected they passed the buck to Lufthansa who passed the buck to SAS and who in turned passed it to United. With great difficulty my family and I made it back to USA, The SAS flight was horrible. Old plane, poor service, charge for even a soda. Horrible! I came back and filed a complaint with United. They make their feedback site so restrictive that you cannot explain details or upload bills properly. They dont even have a contact number to follow up. When I didnt hear back from United and called Mileageplus service, they basically said that wait your turn and we will call you when we get to it. What arrogance and callousness. Is this customer service? I have had it. I will make every effort not to fly United. But again, do we have a choice anymore. They all consolidated and ensure that they compete to provide the worst service at the highest cost possible. So much for free market economy!",-1

I had a reservation for 5.40 pm flight to Atlanta on Aug 17 that was delayed by 3 hours - reason given was “late inbound crew “.After 3 hours of waiting, the flight was announced cancelled now the reason given was bad weather. The weather was fantastic here and in Atlanta from 5pm -9pm. So I don’t get it. I was going for an important medical two day training course which was starting Aug 18 at 8am to 5.30 pm . So I had to get there in time. They were able to pt me on the next flight which was supposed to depart at 9.36pm but after waiting on plane for 3 hours that was announced as cancelled too due to the thunderstorm. Funny part is we waited on flight for close to 4 hours and the storm now had passed but they could not fly as crew had timed out! I luckily hD no checked in baggage but the folks who did were asked to come back next day at 6 am to pick it up. They were not ready to give out baggage to passengers for whom flying the next day was not an option... again because their crew had gone home. It almost felt like their crew had to rush home once the clock struck a certain hour otherwise they would turn into pumpkins like in the Cinderella story! Then one of their crew members has the audacity to talk to all the stranded passengers badly - He tells us , ""this happens.  Crew has gone home, we are humans not machines, we need to go home too! We can’t give you bags today. Come back at 6 am"" Just unacceptable! I will never fly United again - if you are fond of being mistreated and insulted, this is the airline for you!",-1
2018-08-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Cleveland,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,worst flight experience,True,"  Chicago to Cleveland. The worst flight experience I’ve ever had. This summer alone I’ve flown on three separate airlines. I have never lost a bag or had a bag put on the wrong flight until I flew this airline. Not only do they over charge for checked bags they mishandle them and treat you like it’s not their fault. I’ve always been weary of this airline because of their tendency to have their name in the news for negative reasons. This flight has been a prime example of why I will avoid United Airlines for the rest of my life. From Punta Cana to ORD there was hardly any service and they took thirty minutes to get us off the plane. We had a two hour layover in ORD which should have given us plenty of time to get our bags, go through customs, recheck our bag, go through security, and get something to eat before our next flight; of course with United that wasn’t the case. They took 30 minutes to get us off the plane (again), they took twice that to get our bags off of the flight, and they finally lost one of our bags and put it on another flight. Let’s just hope that the baggage check attendant (the only positive part and person from this terrible experience) is correct in saying it will be delivered by today or tomorrow.",-1

A 6 hour delay was the absolute worst experience of my entire life I have never been so  uncomfortable, and tired in my whole life. Every step of the process was delayed. We left late. Had to stop at a different airport for gas. And now we’re sitting here waiting for a ground crew.",-1
2018-08-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Redmond to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst flight experience,True,"  Redmond to Los Angeles. This is the worst flight experience I have had in a long time, luckily I have plenty of time waiting in the airport to write reviews. It started at the check in counter where I was informed that my economy ticket only allowed one bag under the seat, no use of the overhead bin, therefore I had to check my one carry on bag for $25. At the gate they announced that a different flight (to San Fran) was delayed 3.5 hours because they had to fly in a part for the plane from Portland. 15 minutes later they come up with a solution, the airline chose to take the plane from my flight and use it for the San Fran rout instead. Now my wife and I get to wait an extra 3.5 hours instead! My wife has to go back out of security to talk to someone from the airline, who tells her no there aren't any more flights and no we won't be compensated for the inconvenience of missing the party we are flying to LA for. Now I'm at the only airport bar where the credit card reader is broken, so no food/drinks while we wait. This sucks, we are definitely flying Alaska next time. Flight UA5644",-1

Third week in a row flying from Chicago to Dallas on the 5am flight for business. And each week United has had “unplanned maintenance” or “schedule disruptions” with all flights being delayed 2+ hours. Get your act together United. Have flown with 5+ airlines and United is by far the worst one.,-1
2018-08-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Frankfurt via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a terrible experience,True,"  It's been a terrible experience so far with United and Middle East Airlines getting my luggage back! Flying back home to Lebanon after a great vacation with my family in the US ended up with a chaotic return. Arriving to Beirut airport, none of my bags made it to the belt as we waited for our 5 bags. After constantly chasing United and MEA for our luggage we got 1 bag out of 5, 2 days after our arrival. A couple of days later we got another 3. It's been 10 days now and I am still missing 1 bag! Yet the biggest issue is the fact that United and MEA still cannot locate my bag! I don't understand how an established airline like United can make such a careless error! I can't express how disappointed I am that a Star Alliance airline cannot manage the basic customer service request of finding my bag. I am not sure what kind of compensation they plan on giving me at this point.",-1
2018-08-15,0.8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,5,would recommend United Airlines,True,"  London Heathrow to Los Angeles. I have heard several different things about United's long-haul product, so I didn't know what to expect. Whatever expectations I did have on United's long-haul product were exceeded. Due to the fact that it was a flight to the United States, we had to go through additional security checks and ""recheck-in"" at a United service counter. It was a quick and efficient process. Our flight departed Heathrow thirty minutes past the scheduled time. The flight was nearly full, and I had a window seat on this flight. The seat configuration on the 787 was a 3-3-3. Once in the air, a refreshments service occurred, which was followed by lunch. There were two options: chicken or pasta. I opted for the pasta, and it was pretty decent. It came with some sort of grain and corn salad, as well as a bread roll, butter, cheese and crackers. It was a good portion of food. The United Economy seat was very comfortable with heaps of legroom by economy standards. It is made of leather and reclines relatively far back. The inflight entertainment was outstanding, with plenty of choices and a very modern and responsive touchscreen. The seat was also fully wired with a headphone jack, a USB port and a power outlet below the seat. In addition, I would definitely recommend flying on the 787 because the windows are much larger and darken at the touch of a button. The inflight service was okay, not up to par with Lufthansa or Austrian. Although it was a day flight, I got four hours of sleep with the blanket and pillow provided, both very comfortable. Before arrival we were served a warm turkey sandwich, as well as fresh fruit, chips and a cookie. All of it was delicious, especially the fruit, which was a nice touch. We landed in Los Angeles 18 minutes before scheduled arrival. Overall, United's hard product (the seat and entertainment) are outstanding, however their service needs a little work. I would recommend United Airlines and I certainly look forward to flying them again.",1

Leave Talkeetna, AK to drive to Anchorage for Flight ~3.5 hours. Wait 1.5 to board for 6 hour flight to Chicago. When checking in, find out Connecting flight to Rochester cancelled and I am being re-routed through Newark, NJ. No email, text, or update of any sort. Then I wait 2.5 hours for layover to Newark for 1.75 hour flight to Newark. When I get to Newark, flight status stated “Awaiting on Plane”. From 9am- 3:30pm with countless updates saying we were awaiting plane. Updated every 30-45 mins we new departure time. Told countless times plane is on the way, plane should be here shortly, etc. 2:00-2:30pm, attendant called over speaking saying plane was being “towed” to our gate and to be ready to board immediately after it shows up. 3:20pm - flight is cancelled 3:30-5:35 - stand in customer service line waiting to talk to someone. Tried to explain myself and representative was very rude. Let other people cut whole line with cancellations, not just the people who were doing normal check in. Two attendants working line of over 40 customers. What does customer service do? Puts me on a flight at 10:00pm arriving in Rochester at 11:24pm and a couple meal vouchers? Seriously? What about the breakfast, lunch, and dinner I already purchased while being lied to all day about the plane “pulling up shortly”? Had I known this I would have gotten a rental and drove 10 HOURS AGO! I had to miss another day of work after being on vacation for over a week. I am a single father full time in work and school and never get to do things like this. I will never fly this terrible excuse of an airline again.",-1
2018-08-15,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to London,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline have ever flown,True,"  
Newark to London. Over the last 6 months I have flown multiple times with United Airlines. I can say without hesitation this is by far the worst airline in the world I have ever flown with. I have had multiple occasions of delayed flights, sleeping in airports, damaged and lost luggage (steel reinforced cases may I add that still get smashed), rude customer service agents, missold upgrades and rude flight attendants. I have been offered a $400 voucher in compensation of all of these however when I tried to use it, they said it's not valid for anything other than booking new flights. So my existing flights that are booked months in advance, I cannot use this on. Naturally, I don't want to fly again with United so the compensation is useless. Honestly, I can rant all day about these guys but they don't care anyway so realistically there is no point. Just save yourselves a headache and stress and use a different airline, United should be ashamed of themselves.",-1
2018-08-15,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lima to Minneapolis via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,four days to get home,False,  Lima to Minneapolis via Newark. A mission group of 20 people who booked our flights two years in advanced were delayed 3 times in the matter of 32 hours beginning in Peru were we had a 24 hour delay cause the flight got delayed and the connecting flight was to close in time to our arrival. Then we got another 7 hour delay at the airport before getting onto the plane to Newark. Once in Newark the flight was delayed again because there were other delays making it so our flight attendants wouldn’t get here on time. In conclusion it has taken us four days to get home when it should have taken one. Will not travel with United again.,-1

I flew in to Chicago from Boston, the flight was delayed, by the time i got to Chicago the flight to Springfield was gone. I'm forced to spend the night and they wont even pay for a hotel. Offered me 150$ future travel voucher and a meal ticket. The voucher they sent me says if i accept it I release them of liability.  The flight I was rebooked on was 24 hrs later at 9:30 pm the next night - I've had travel issues with airlines before but I have never been treated so badly with such disdain before. When i tried to ask questions at customer service the rep actually ignored my questions completely only talking to me when he wanted to.",-1

I was flying from Vancouver to Denver and I checked in hour and a half before the departure time. Even though the bag check took so long, I was still able to make it to the gate 5-10 minutes before the flight departed but they refused to open the gate for me and have already unloaded my bag. They booked me on another flight to Denver where I will have 15 h layover before the connecting flight to Madison. The plane hasn't left when I arrived and I wasn't the only person did not board. I did not miss the flight, is them who left me and probably gave a seat which I paid for away! Terrible behavior and no commitment to customers.",-1

Our first flight was delayed so we had to completely reschedule all our connecting flights. We made it to Houston to wait for our next flight and after waiting 2 hours our flight was delayed another 3 hours. After 8 delays/times changes for our flight and 7 hours of sitting in the airport all they did to help us was give us a $10 voucher. We asked about the delays to try to figure out what was going on and see if there was another option. We were responded to very rudely and disrespectfully any time a question was asked and were not given any sort of response besides “can’t help you”. I will never be flying United again.,-1
2018-08-12,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Chicago,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,3.0,3,delayed indefinitely,True," My flight from San Francisco to Chicago got delayed indefinitely. I was able to change the plane, but the other plane got delayed too! My flight back to San Francisco also was delayed by an hour because it has arrived from Denver, CO later than expected; I heard that's because the original plane got broken and United had to replace it. This seems to be a pattern. There should be some serious systemic problems killing United and there is no evidence the United management cares about it. On the other hand, United customer service reps were helpful and crews on both planes were nice. Overall, I now regret that several years ago I got a Chase United credit card and made United my default choice for air travel. In the retrospect, it was not a wise decision.",-1

I recommend not flying with United Airlines because they have the worst time management. They boarded the passengers on the plane and were getting ready to depart. Over the intercom the flight attendant said “The captain had a family emergency so we are getting a new one and he will be here in an hour and a half”. Ok, pretty normal stuff happens right? We come back an hour later, sit at our gate, and we hear the person say “Um, there seems to be a sudden maintenance issue that may take several hours” It was 2:04pm when they said that and I boarded at 6:25pm. Thats 5 hours (including waiting for the pilot). Do not fly united, they are terrible.",-1

Then they started boarding, since I was very tired a fall asleep, I woke up over an hour latter when people were getting out of the plane, I thought we arrived to Chicago. But no the plane moved to another gate and that’s it. We had a delay of 12 hours. I could drive for less money and headache. I would not recommend United if time is really important to you.",-1

I have never experienced such disrespect in customer service before. When my flight was delayed from 10:50pm to 6:30am because the pilot decided to not show up, i tried to get help from the person at the front desk and he told me he couldn’t help because he was “off work and not getting paid for this.” Then, we were not given hotel accommodations because we were “local” even though I live an hour away. Now, on the flight that has already been delayed by 8 hours we are still sitting on the tarmac waiting for the first officer who didn’t account for the fact that there was going to be traffic. I cannot explain the amount of frustration I have, because I think there is a way to handle these type of situations, and United absolutely does not know how to do it. I’ve never experienced such disrespect from customer service representatives, or such a lack of compensation for their actions. Will not be flying with united ever again.",-1

This was my second time flying with United, the first times was a disaster, missed connecting flight due to incompetent TSA, then the new flight was delayed 4 times, i swore never to fly with them again but 3 years later i decided to give it another shot. Once again they validated their incompetence by messing up my tickets. They checked my 9 yr old in as an infant causing massive confusion, back and forth trips to different attendants, leading to the missing of our flight. They rebook us onto the next flight only to have us miss that as well because surprise! They gave us the wrong tickets again. Absolutely awful customer service. Only 2 times i have flown this airline and both times they have ruined my flights and made no attempt to accommodate us for the massive inconvenience. Never ever will i be foolish enough to purchase from United again.",-1

I didn't have an option when it came to flights as I was flying through a tour group. But our flight was delayed 3 hours - and the plane itself was sitting in the port the entire time but they waited to fill the fuel up just as we were boarding; delaying us even further. When questioned on alternative options/compensation in any form for the inconvenience we were ignored. They have horrible customer service - attitudes from every United employee within the airport itself. I would never voluntarily choose United for future travel.,-1

At the day of my flight, I went to the airport and I surprised that there is a special line for New York travelers, then I knew that the airplane got cancelled! Without even knowing then I tried to find different route because it is a board exam and I won’t be able to postpone it. And after plenty of begging I was able to change my routes to SF then to NY. Both flights got delayed and we still don’t know the reason! Finally, today I’m going back to Sacramento, and now I’m at the airport and received a text message telling me that the plane got delayed 1 hr and 30 min! Guys please avoid this bad airline until they improve their commitments to passengers. Because right now they don’t care about their passengers as having a lot of customers.

My flight started with the announcement that the flight is over-booked and so someone had to leave, they offered $450, a flight next morning in first class and a hotel for the night. I didnt take it. I had boarding group 5 but somehow managed to board the plane first. Seats were actually better than at most of translantic flight, legroom was fine, width wasn't that bad too. Entertaiment screens was however just ads, so the only way to watch movies was to download the United app and then watch, but there was big selection of movies so actually a good entertaiment system, food was for purchase, drinks were free. The crew was nice too. We departed at time, and arrived earlier, we only waited 10 minutes on tarmac. I dont understand why is United so hated. I had an excellent experience.",1

The airline handled their difficulties very poorly. The did not check the plane until it was about to take of, they held us on the tarmac for 2 hours, announced a mechanical problem, than delayed the flight for another two hours, and then surprise! The flight attendants became out of legal hours - didn’t they know they are delaying the the flight over and over. They put us in line for hotel vouchers, a 3 hours line to get our vouchers, this is a true torture- the flight was suppose to leave 6 hours ago- it is now almost 2 pm. Everyone is exhausted and they don’t have enough stuff to put us in the hotel. Stay away from this unprofessional outfit. I’ll never use them again.",-1

After speaking to three different representatives on the phone who refused to help me, the manager of the supervisor of the original staff member I spoke to put me on an earlier flight and told me I was good to go. After arriving at my new gate, the O'Hare employee at the gate informed that I was never checked-in so I didn't have a seat on the plane and that I might not make it out. That flight was then cancelled, and my checked bag eventually flew to LaGuardia on my original flight and instead of offering to deliver it to my house, United insisted that I come back to the airport in two days to pick it up. Long story short, the customer service provided by this airline is terrible, I'm never flying them again and I can tell you if you're ever in need of help this airline will do absolutely nothing for you.",-1

The seats were very uncomfortable and felt super hard leather. There was no exact entertainment system so instead you had to put your phone or ipad inside the holder which I didn't have with me. They didn't have that much stuff for breakfast. The United Wi-Fi was super expensive : $11 for 1 hour, $15 for 2 hours, $21 for full flight. They only offered one website free which was unitedwifi.com where for free you could stream a limited number of movies for free without being able to access the rest of the internet.

The gate operations and boarding went fine in Boise, and we departed on time. The problem started in San Francisco (SFO). When arriving in SFO, the pilot came on the intercom, alerting us to a computer problem ""Only effecting Skywest flights"" and that the plane couldn't, leave the gate since without the computer they couldn't do anything, but don't worry we would have it all cleared up in 20 minutes. 1 hour and 40 minutes later, they started to taxi around the tarmac in an effort to look like we were getting somewhere. At 2 hours we did finally get into the gate. We were told that most outbound flights were delayed so, Hurry and get to your gate and you can probably still get your connection. I rushed, I made it onto the plane. After about 20 minutes I noticed that we were not moving. Within a few minutes the flight crew arrives. The pilot announces that since they had been stuck on the Tarmac just like the rest of us, that they were about to ""Time Out:"" and that they were waiting for another flight crew to come aboard so that they could take over in Fresno. A few minutes later they announce that ""The Flight crew has arrived and they are waiting on the Jetway for paperwork."" Another hour passes, and still no flight crew. At exactly 2 hours after closing the plane they open it again, this time to announce that since they don't have seats for the new flight crew (There was 2 Deadhead crew already on the plane) that they would have to trade out the flight crew now. (Why it took them 2 hours to make this decision I don't know) At this time a New Voice comes over the intercom announcing that ""If You are going to get off Plane do so Now."" No explanation just a threatening voice, with no offer to re-book on another plane. Around 15 minutes later the captain (1st Crew) walks back into the cabin to explain what was going on and says that the new crew would be on the plane in a few minutes. Around 20 minutes later the new crew does arrive, and the Captain announces that as soon as they completed the inspection, and they had completed paper work we would be leaving, ""It should be about 20 minutes"". We all had a good laugh. I have never heard passengers catcall the pilot before. Well after another hour (The flight is now 4.5 hours late in departure) they push us back from the gate and start the plane. We eventually take off and arrive in Fresno 5 hours late.",-1

Upon arrival at SFO they told us they have found the luggage at LAX and that they will deliver it in the evening since they have a flight every hour. After we went to our house we checked with the automated messaging system and that we get a message saying that it is out for delivery. We were waiting for the whole night since it had very important item in it but with no avail. Finally we contacted the agents but they did not have any communication with their drivers to tell us the ETA. On our earlier flight from SFO to LAX they lost 9 out of 10 luggage. We received those luggages three days later at our vacation destination. We had to endure those three important vacation days without required medication and daily requirement needs in our vacation. Of course no compensation for all those pain and inconvenience at all. In my view United is in-efficient with bad management to cause me this kind of inconvenience and pain for being it's customer. I would not recommend it for anyone unless this is the only airline that is left in the world.,-1

I am a frequent traveler, first and last time with United. Our flights from Montréal to Dulles and from Dulles to Cancun were OK, no more no less, had to pay for anything more than drinks. Staff wasn't particularly nice, nor rude, just doing their job. The way back, though. Another story. The flight from Cancun to Dulles was juste a few minutes late, no big deal. Pilot put the pedal to the metal and we were actually there in advance. Then our flight to Montreal was delayed. By 30 min, then 1 hour, then 2 hours, 2 and a half... Next thing we know, it is past midnight and our flight is cancelled. We waited at the ticket counter for 20 min to be transfered on another flight, only to finally have them tell us that they're re-switching us back on the same flight that they decided last minute to postpone to the following morning. Caused all kinds of problems at check-in after we spent the night at the airport hotel, since they gave the flight a different number. Needless to say the plane was 20 min late the following day. Never flying United again. Lost 8 hours of work because of their disorganization.",-1

Flight on time, but this aircraft is incredibly cramped, even in their so-called Economy Plus. In fact, I don't think it was any roomier than any of the other seats. The interior of the aircraft itself was tattered and worn. The flight attendant was very nice and professional, but her appearance could have been a bit more polished. I realize this is 2018 and working as a flight attendant isn't a beauty contest, but certainly there's a professional and corporate image to uphold, even at United.",1

2018-07-30,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Raleigh via Newark,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3,experience was pretty bad,True,"  Dublin to Raleigh via Newark. I have never left a review for an airline in 30 years of travel (first time for everything). Our flight experience yesterday was pretty bad, and after dealing with the customer service today, I feel the need to write this. First, dropping our checked bags at the Dublin airport took 50 minutes which I find ridiculous (thank goodness we arrived 3 hours early). The staff wasn't exactly efficient or in a hurry. Second, our flight was delayed 45 minutes to Newark. That's fine, delays happen, but when I tried asking a flight attendant if we were in jeopardy of missing our connection, it took 30 minutes for me to even flag someone down on the flight (even though my call light was on the whole time), and she was extremely rude and short. The flight attendants in general were less than friendly, especially when I asked if they had snacks for purchase and the attendant looked at me like I was dumb and said no. Got it. We finally arrive to our final destination in Raleigh and our bags did not arrive with us. We were informed they'd be on the next flight, but since we live three hours away, they said they would have them flown to Columbia, SC and would arrive Saturday night around 11pm, and then would be delivered to us.  No big deal again, we get these things happen. Well, here we are Sunday at 10:00am, and the bags are nowhere to be found.  It took me 30+ minutes to speak with someone in customer service and the language barrier is so bad, that I still don't know when our bags will arrive or why they didn't make the flight to Columbia last night. It’s not the poor man’s fault, sometimes it’s just too difficult for both parties. I asked to speak to a supervisor but was told he was busy and would call me back (doubtful). I also called back and asked if I could speak with someone whose native language was English to avoid the language barrier and frustration (two attempts failed). They finally told me calls are globally routed and I'd have to keep calling until a native English speaker answered (30 min wait time each call). This goes far beyond things out of United’s control happening, and today finally made me realize it’s just terrible customer service.  I am done making excuses for United and the people I have dealt with during my travels.  No desire to travel on this airline again. I’m flustered so I’m sure there are typos. Great trip where I got engaged and ended on a bad note. Now we need to buy a bunch of items just so we can go to work tomorrow morning.",-1
2018-07-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Los Angeles,2.0,,2.0,,,2.0,1,worst flight experience ever,True," United must be trying to coerce Basic Economy buyers to upgrade by treating you like complete garbage. One of their rude staff members even told us our experience was the way it was (very very terrible) because we bought Basic Economy tickets. The staff from the DIA ticket counter to the gate were all unprofessional and rude. Our worst flight experience ever, and we've had many flights, was on this flight. This was the first time we bought a Basic Economy ticket, although unknowingly through a popular online reseller. So to start, we found out you only get one personal item and no small carry-on. Usually we have our small carry-on and personal item, which fit just fine under the seat with room to spare for our feet. Second, there is no online check-in, you will waste your time trying like I did. Third, when you go to the airport, numerous United signs tell you to use a kiosk to check in. That doesn't work either, as the kiosk instructs you to go to a ticketing agent to waste time. You have to look for a tiny little section off to the left that reads ""Economy"", where it is manned by a single representative. Fourth, once we got to the rude Economy ticketing agent, he pretended to not know why the kiosk rejected us so we had to show him. He quickly reminded us that we have the junk ""Basic Economy"" tickets. Then, we tried to hand our checked/labeled baggage to said rude agent since he had a scale one feet to his left, and he points to the other longer line and says ""it goes over there"". On to the bag line, the lady there was no better. She tells my wife in a rude tone (while also talking angrily to her coworkers), ""License and boarding pass!"" No ""hello"", no ""how are you"", not even a complete sentence, and they weren't even very busy so it surely couldn't have been that she was rushing or stressed out. After a very long security line wait with ultra slow TSA workers, we finally got to the gate and the door had just shut. This part was only partially United's fault due to lack of online check-in and their deceiving kiosk signs which wasted a good 30 minutes of precious time. The United gate agent was completely unprofessional and bitter and lacked any sympathy whatsoever. She kept telling me, in very stern fashion, to check my ticket next time as if I were new to flying. With a reluctant look on her face and body language, she got us onto a later flight. We lost our purchased seats, and my 8 year old was assigned a seat away from our group next to complete strangers. To conclude, making United staff do any extra work is a crime so steer clear of United Airlines.",-1

This airline has very poor practices, and bad customer service. Our flight between Newark and San Juan my parents and I had paid extra ($75USD each) to pick our seats by getting economy plus. Upon checking in online, we discovered that they gave up our seats, and now we no longer had seats. We then called to get our seats back. This did not happen. They instead gave us seats close to each other. Okay fine... BUT when arriving to the airport we go to print our boarding passes and again discover that we DO NOT have seats! So we have been told on the phone to settle things at the Toronto airport, then we were told to settle things at the Newark airport, and finally we were told that they can’t do anything. Why did we spend about $250USD just to get shuffled around? Stop charging people for services that you are not providing. That is a scam, plain and simple. You said that it happens when aircrafts shift, but that’s your problem. I paid for this service and expect to get seats without the hassle that we have been through.",-1

Completely unacceptable and ridiculous excuse for delaying a flight for hundreds of customers. I find it hard to believe that an airline as large as this does not have sufficient crew members and back up teams. On top of everything the waiting area gate only has enough seats for 20 or so people, United decided to rip out the rest and replace them with useless iPads for gambling, so most people have been standing or sitting on the floor waiting for updates. Their on-flight entertainment is awful as well.",-1

Flew into Newark, NJ and was immediately told our flight was delayed an hour. Several minutes later our flight was cancelled. They proceeded to line us up and tell us one by one the next possible flight was the following day and they would not be offering any reimbursement or hotel accommodations. 32-weeks pregnant at the time, I expected any sort of accommodation for the hundreds of dollars I lost in my hotel arrangements for the Rochester area and missing a rehearsal dinner. No explanation offered. Absolutely horrible customer service at the counter. Exact words from our attendant ""Mam I am not abliged to offer anything aside from a rescheduled flight at 8am tomorrow morning."" They expect families with children and elders to stay in the horrible smelling and dirty airport for 20 hours. Despicable. Forever lost my business.",-1

I was told if I changed/postponed my wife’s flight, and submitted documentation from the hospital it would be a refundable $200 charge.(no problem) I canceled and tried to rebook the next day for 4 days later. Well, $200 change fee plus an additional $200 for a different day fare. Supervisor said “sorry nothing we can do”. I ate the original fare and booked her on Frontier, only to pick her up and take her back to our local hospital.  Thanks United for being so compassionate.

Our 10:55 am Flight was initially delayed 2 hours and a food voucher was provided. At the gate it is announced the flight is delayed, for unknown reasons. The plane is at the gate. Many delay anouncements follow, each stating that boarding is to begin in 20 or 30 minutes. Gate agents can’t provide any information on why we aren’t boarding, I was told they were making an engine repair, another woman was told they were replacing a windshield wiper. After more than 4 hours of being held hostage at the gate, we are finally provided with water. After six hours we are allowed to board. We taxi to the runway and are told we are 3rd in line for take off. Then the pilot announces they’ve exceeded ground hours and we are returning to the airport. Not a gate, but a small door. United has no gate at VCE, no United employees either. Baggage is delayed for about an hour, another hour in line for hotel voucher, another hour ride to the hotel, finally eat food at 9:30 pm. Back on the bus at 5:30am. Long day, tired, hungry, upset, no explanations. Not a good way to end a nice vacation. United offered no compensation other than the 600 euro as required by law. I would like to know why the flight was delayed, what was wrong with the plane, why so many small delays and no customer service.",-1

First, I bought a ticket in May for a wedding in September, the wedding was cancelled so I called to see what I could do. I was told I had to cancel my ticket to request a refund and that it would be processed in 7 business days (this was July 6th, still 3 months ahead of the wedding date!) Then, I went on a trip from July 12-24 to Aruba, United cancelled out flight from Houston to Aruba and we had to fly all the way up to Newark, NJ and spend the night in the freezing cold airport in order to get to Aruba on time for our house check in. There is hardly any leg room, the workers are rude and very unhelpful! On the trip back we had to fly to Miami, we had to collect and recheck and repay for our luggage! $200 worth! Then, even though we had just carried on a bag and a personal item, we were told we couldn't on the next flight because we were group 9! Seriously? Thankfully we had a better airline from Houston home! Then, when I got home I checked the status of my refund only to find that they ""can't refund my ticket"" so now I am out almost $400 and they will be making money on the seat that I cancelled! Seriously wrong! If I was told I would get the refund, they should honor that regardless of the policy! That is misleading and theft! Worst airline ever! Do not use them unless you want to be screwed over, a lot!",-1

I took 6 different flights with United Airlines within a 3 week period and they were never on time. Lost my luggage. I found myself running from aircraft to aircraft unable to use the bathroom or grab a bite to eat between my layover. I was upset about my lost luggage and when I entered Bangor a United employee told me to “change my tone or she would call the cops”. This is after I almost missed the second plane because there first one was yet again late. I chocked on the plane for 20 minutes because of how quickly I had to run to the next or I would have missed it. For the love of God avoid the steps on your vacation and take another airline.,-1

The first day my flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day. I came again and the flight was delayed so I was not going to make my connecting flight, so they told me I could not board. I came the 3rd day to board my flight and successfully got to Newark. After waiting in the airport for 11 hours because it was the only available flight, I had another delay in Newark. I called to try to receive compensation and was told it probably wouldn’t happen because it was weather related, yet the last plane was not delayed due to weather. I was told to file online and I have and still have not heard back. I have spent money on a train and a hotel I haven’t been there due to the delay and now I’m being told I probably will not be compensated. I am beyond furious and will never fly United again.",-1
2018-07-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Venice,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,not flying United ever again,True,"  Newark to Venice. Never again will I fly United. This was the worst flight ever. For a transatlantic, red eye flight, the seats were unbelievably uncomfortable.  The padding was super thin, the headrests flopped over whenever you brushed against them, and the recline was non-existent in economy. A lengthy delay to start my trip didn't help, but that could have happened on any airline so I won't knock United too much on this. I fly from NY to San Francisco a lot for work on American, their economy seats are like first class compared to these United seats. My United aircraft had the new Polaris design with smaller seats, it should be banned. The meals onboard were fine, for my son. I was jealous of his kids meal, dinosaur chicken nuggets and veggies. The adult meals, people were asking flight attendents what was in them, and the flight attendants didn't know. It was either ""chicken"", ""veggie"", or ""pasta"". If a flight attendant can't tell you what's in a meal, would you want to eat it? Seatback entertainment was above average, they had a good selection of TV and movies. And it worked well. I'm not flying United ever again. Maybe for a short flight, but not for an overseas or transcontinental flight. M",-1

Not only that, I can’t walk and they made me feel like I was a complete burden. A wheelchair took forever even though we told them ahead of time we needed help.

We were told that it simply would take longer due to weather twice in that entire time. No information about missing flights was given. Due to the nature of customs people are told to not get in their bags or be on their phones. It also means we are without access to any food you may have packed. Unless it was less than 3.4 ounces, we have no access to drinks. If you want to not feel like a trapped animal, pick any other airline.",-1

It was my first time flying alone so you can imagine how terrifying it is to be stranded alone being a young woman in an airport. My flight was cancelled due to weather conditions so I'm told but I'm able to be on standby for the next flight out? I don't know how much sense that makes, because wouldn't the other flights be cancelled as well? Especially if the weather says it's only going to get worse. So i go to customer service, only for the lady to tell me my only options are to be on standby for a flight being that in the event a person don't show, I get to go home ? I paid about $500 for a flight that usually costs $120 only to be told the airline won't be doing what I payed them to do, their job. Instead I get a ""sorry about that "", maybe 24hrs from now I'll get to go home! So I'm stuck in the airport until then, while I'm offered no compensation for wasting my time, being stranded, or causing me to have to call in to my job because the airline has failed me as a customer. Overall I'm still stuck and the airline hasn't taken responsibility for not doing their part as a business. My experience is ruined with this airline.",-1

First, our flight on Monday from Geneva to Newark was problematic and when we landed we received a cell phone apology and told that we could receive a ""token"" concrete apology if we went online (no thanks). At Newark our direct flight to Milwaukee was first delayed two hours due to the crew not yet arriving and then it was cancelled entirely. UA first told us that we would not be able to fly out until Wednesday evening, two days later than our schedule and they would not pay for any hotel accommodations! There was a United flight to Milwaukee within the next two hours but it was full. When we again asked about flights to other airports they told us we could fly to Minneapolis, stay overnight at our own expense, and then fly to Chicago on Tuesday and then from Chicago to Milwaukee later that day. When we asked UA to pay for a Minneapolis hotel (they cancelled the flight!) the UA rep said that the cancellation was due to an ""air traffic control situation"" so UA wasn't going to do squat for us. We took the Minneapolis flight and the UA rep said our luggage would be put on that plane but when we arrived in Minneapolis the UA rep there told us our luggage was sent to Milwaukee! So no change of clothes or toiletries, just what we had in our carry on. The UA baggage chief in Minneapolis was curt and dismissive, and couldn't have cared less about us. We are now sitting in the Minneapolis Airport at 5 AM (and 4 hours of sleep in the hotel) after being in transit for 36 hours from Geneva, and can only wonder what is in store for us on the next two legs of our trip home. We have never experienced such poor service and no interest in customer care when foul ups occur on the airline's side. Avoid United Airlines!

I notified UA baggage services in Seattle and was told (very rudely) that because I didn’t have the claim ticket it wasn’t their fault but they would help anyway, which consisted of the agent logging my lost baggage in their “system” and washing their hands of it. The baggage agent in Seattle was shockingly rude and uncaring. Figuring that was the last I would hear from UA on this matter, I phoned ANA’s US reservation number and found someone who immediately took it upon herself to find a supervisor who called the Bangkok station manager. They found my bag and routed it to SeaTac airport on the next flight. I’m here picking up my bag, yet the UA bag tracking website and call center are still assuring me that, while My bag has not been found, they are attempting to locate it.

The flight was cancelled on account of bad weather. United automatically rebooked me on the 1850 flight. The 1850 was delayed until 2305 on account of a late incoming aircraft. Understandable due to the bad weather but communication by United was bad. Departure time kept changing. I tracked the incoming flight and it showed 2138 arrival yet United showed the departure time as 2045 hrs which was misleading. Asked if my bags would be loaded onto the later flight and was told yes. They sent a “move message” to ensure my bags would make the later flight. Finally landed in Seattle 6.5 hours late and to add insult to injury, both my bags didn’t make it. Here’s where the real problem began. United didn’t call me even once. Their toll free number and websites gave no information. The only way I could get any information wAs by going to the airport to speak to an agent.

You have to pay for carry-ons and pay to pick your seat, in addition to your ticket. So awful. One agent even threatened to refuse a woman on the plan for the size of her purse.

My husband and I were not seated together I was in row 28 and he was in row 38 with 2 gentlemen of about 7 ft tall. They were father and son basketball players the son with ASU. My husband was bruised on his foot by the lack of room in the seats. The bathrooms were locked for the first hour while the inept crew attended a woman with a seizure probably due to the excessive heat in the cabin. Another woman threw up and there was no cart service for the first half of the trip. When I spoke to the crew about the heat that was so bad most people were spillled over into the aisle as the seats were suffocating. I was told to turn on my air vent which was fully open. Duh! We were instructed to only use the bathroom in our assigned cabin, once they were finally open. The access to the bathroom was obstructed by the stretched out legs of the 7 ft man who should never been moved to the last row where the seat room is mallet due to airline design and lack of reclining seats although the row in front reclines into thenpassengers face",-1

Most horrible airline i’ve ever flown with. 20 minutes of storm means 12 hours of delay. They kept postponing the boarding time so you keep counting the hours down but then they keep adding them up. The resources or explanations are not given to any of the passengers, so we just get told to ‘sit down and relax’ like sitting ducks.

What a horrible experience with United Airlines. This so called company is great at taking your money but if there is one bit of an issue, then you have to speak with a supposed customer service that is in the Philippines and all they do is say ""sorry, so sorry you have a bad opinion of us"". We've been stuck without any clothes or hotel and they basically wash their hands and blame it on the airlines. I used them once before and spent over $15K with them and more of the same. It was my mistake to comeback for a second round of abuse with this so called company.",-1

After numerous announcements we would be leaving we were asked to reboard. Twice a flight attendant was rude, cart with water and snacks pushed away from me. We were offered a meal voucher which we never got because they took so long to distribute them and when I got close was told we were boarding. After everyone was seated and thought we were finally leaving we were told the plane needed 20 minutes to fuel. An hour later we were told there was another delay because commissary hadn't delivered yet. At that point passengers raised objections to the delay while flight attendants laughed at us. My wife and I were stunned at how unprofessional they handled the situation. We arrived 5.5 hours late in Houston.",-1

",False,"  We did not leave Melbourne until 1.5 hours after the departure time. Both my Daughter and myself did not mind but were concerned about our connecting flight. We were well treated and looked after on the plane and the staff were exceptional in their service to everyone. On landing we ran through the airport and yes we did miss our connection. At 64 years old its not an experience I wish to have again and not a nice start to our holiday. But this is nothing compared to the ignorant, arrogant and rushed manner that we were treated to all the way back to Australia on the return flight by a crew that treated everyone as if we should sit back say nothing and dont dare interfere with their time. I am not exaggerating their response. Should be ashamed of themselves. Shocking!",-1

It’s now close to 10pm and no word on when we will be leaving. I have been here for over 5 hours and counting for no reason regarding weather delays.

It left Seattle late and arrived late to Chicago. Connecting flight was cancelled. Teen traveling alone and she received very little help from United employees in finding new flight. New flight booked and then delayed twice as well. Gate assignment kept changing - very rough landing in Chicago as well. They refused to let her carry on her bag and when she finally arrived in Knoxville after a nightmare day of travel and United had lost her bag - left it in Chicago. My daughter felt like she never wants to fly United again!,-1

We setup for next day at 6:39 am and no advise that we had to go to another gate, we lost flight. Now we setup for 6:45 pm and we dont really know if we are going to meet our vacation deadline since we already missed the day. Some customer service are doing their job but some think their doing it free. They play with your pain and dont care about the customers, if they would call me about the canceled flight then everything would be different, we paid taxi 4 times already, food, aggravation, wasting our money in our vacation package all because United airlines irresponsible customer service that never told us that out original flight was canceled, this so aggravating.

2018-07-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Lansing via Chicago,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,We were miserable the whole time,True," We were very disappointed in United Airlines! When we got to our gate at Salt Lake airport at 4pm there were travelers that had been waiting since 9am due to aircraft maintenance, (a hydraulic seal). It didn't delay our flight but put a bad taste in our mouth right from the beginning. The customer service on ground and in the air was just OK. After we boarded all the TV screens were flashing DirecTV propaganda. Saying to swipe your card now and then later saying it was $5.99 for flights under 2.5 hours and $7.99 for flights over 2.5 hours. But they offered a *very generous* discount of $2 each if you swipe the same card on 3 or more screens. They advertise that they have free wifi though! So we connected and downloaded their app with no problem. But after selecting a movie and pressing watch, it makes you enable airplane mode in case of a connection interruption. But after doing so and pressing watch again, it says it can't connect, the same thing happened on our return flight. Which I'm sure forces or tricks people into paying for the DirecTV, which was very glitchy and the sound quality was terrible. So I'm glad we didn't end up paying for that. We landed 10 minutes late and our connecting flight was on the other side of O'Hare and we had 15-20 minutes to get there. We got to the gate with 5 minutes to spare after running the whole way. On our return flight, there were tons of people in the gate room waiting because of another aircraft maintenance delay. This caused us to have to move gates which wasn't a huge deal but still annoying. Our flight was also delayed about 30 minutes. When we boarded the cabin it was very hot and stuffy and barely went away by the end of the flight. We were miserable the whole time. Needless to say their airplanes are not properly maintained and are way out of date, (they still had an ashtray in the bathroom). Compared to Delta, United couldn't be worse. Even Southwest and Frontier are better. 10 or 20 years ago all of this might not have even mattered. Can we say misappropriation of funds? In short, we will never be flying United Airlines ever again.",-1

Top to bottom the worst customer service company I have ever experienced. I watched gate agents laugh while a senior citizen walked to a far gate location to find out his gate had been been changed. This company has a severe mean streak from flight attendants to gate agents to bag handlers. It is as though they hate their customers. I am forced to use them occasionally, but I have quit all of my overseas trips and 90% of my domestic. I cannot imagine any company that deals with customers that would even come close to being this bad.",-1

Our flight home from Cancun with United has been nothing but disastrous. We've been in the airport for hours with no guarantee of an expected arrival time or gate. We're definitely going to miss our connecting flight- and it looks like we ""may"" get home tomorrow. United staff have not been helpful or polite. Do not fly United, it's not worth saving the extra buck. I will never fly United again.",-1
2018-07-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Chicago,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,Disappointment after disappointment,True,"  Boston to Chicago. Do not fly United! There are other airlines more committed to their customer service, value and accommodations with similar prices. Disappointment after disappointment. Long story short things change and I ended up needing to change the time of my flight. Their policy is a 200 dollar change fee which was just as much as the ticket. I even purchased the misleading insurance just in case this might happen and they ONLY cover it if the airline changes or cancels... useless. Other airlines including southwest and jet blue have change fees as low as 60 and some free! So apparently they have a better handle on how to accommodate their flyers. Then I get to the airport and your only allowed one personal shoulder bag or purse, no carry on. I had the tiniest purse and had to check my 15 pound carry on. I didn’t know Airlines don’t allow carry ons these days. (I purchased the basic ticket which was not that much cheaper than other airlines. Had I known this I would have paid more for the ticket with another airline and wouldn’t have to pay for a checked bag)I did not plan to check it and was supposed to change clothes for my destination to fit my busy schedule so was unable to do so. Much less value than other airlines with similar prices. No commitment to the customer experience, old unaccommodating policies and less value. I will absolutely not be flying United again since there is no reason to when I have multiple better choices.",-1
2018-07-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Lincoln,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,"I received no notification""
",True,  I will never fly United again. My flight was delayed 5 hours and I received no notification so I arrived an hour and a half earlier than my original flight. I needed to get to my destination by a certain time for a very important and critical doctors appointment. They rebooked me to a flight that wasn't leaving for another 6 hours and the lady at the gate was so incredibly rude when I approached with questions. I have severe anxiety and was in tears and she complained to the baggage people on the phone aboute while I was standing in front of her. Worst flight service I've ever received.,-1
2018-07-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Phoenix,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,cannot be trusted,True,  San Francisco to Phoenix. I wish I could give this airline negative stars! I used to travel all of the time using any of the major airlines. I have gone through a lot in the last 5 years. Travel has been very scarce. I booked a 2 week trip overseas. My mistake was to let the touring company book the air for me and my second mistake was letting them choose United. They gave only a 45 minute wait between my 2nd and 3rd flight and the plane left over an hour late. Strike 1. My final flight of the day was with Lufthansa. Fortunately Lufthansa got me on another flight but I had to wait 7 hours in an airport. Thank you Lufthansa. Strike 2 United. Coming home from my trip the touring company booked me a 5 hour layover in San Francisco. I already had 24 hours of real traveling time scheduled. After 3 different gate changes in San Francisco they finally said they were having plane maintenance issues. An 8:00 pm flight has now been moved to 10:20 pm at yet another gate. The time I'm leaving this flight is later than my scheduled arrival! United Airlines cannot be trusted to take their passengers to their desired destination in a timely manner. For domestic flights I will now go with Southwest and for international I will go with Delta or Lufthansa.,-1
2018-07-12,0.6,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Miami,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,2.0,5,never turned off the lights,False,"  Frankfurt to Miami. I checked in at the Nice, France airport with Lufthansa and received my three boarding passes. I didn't have to go through security at Frankfurt and after visiting the Lufthansa Star Alliance Lounge I walked to the boarding area. When I showed my boarding pass I was told that I needed to go to Document Check. I then got back in line and there was another problem so I went to the counter. I was told to go back to the end of the line and try again. I'm Group 1 so I wasn't happy about that. The third try I still could not get in through the gate. I was told that because I had an exit row seat I had to go through a different entrance. Good Grief. United is the only airline that I know of that seats 10 across in Premium Economy on a 777-300. The seats are tight with a 17 inch width. About 35 minutes after take-off, they turned the fasten seatbelt sign off. First came a bag of bread sticks, then came a small bottle of water, then came my food with plastic tableware and then the beverage cart with a complementary glass of wine or a beer. There was no hot or moist towel. After all food items were picked up, they came by with another glass of wine or beverage. The fasten seatbelt sign came on several times during the flight because of a very light chop. United has changed the recorded announcement to ""Please fasten your seatbelt."" The German speaking flight attendant had a very loud voice which would have made sleeping difficult, but in the economy cabin, they never turned off the lights or asked people to close their window shades so it was impossible for me to sleep. Prepare for landing, which means the fasten seatbelt sign is on and seats need to be upright was 50 minutes before landing, which makes for a long 50 minutes. When flying to Europe, I would recommend Lufthansa. On my flight a month earlier to Europe, Lufthansa turned off the fasten seatbelt sign seven minutes after take-off and it wasn't turned back on until 25 minutes to landing, a very quiet flight.",1

I do not usually write reviews on anything unless it stands out to me. This airline was the worst flying experience of my life.

2018-07-12,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Atlanta to San Francisco,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,was absolutely horrible,True,"  Atlanta to San Francisco. One of the most inconsiderate customer service experiences that I’ve ever had before with United Airlines! My family and I booked a one way flight from Atlanta to Reno, NV where we were catching a connecting flight in San Francisco on 7/10/18. After boarding the flight in Atlanta at 7:35a, we sat in our designated seats for nearly an hour due to mechanical difficulties that they were having with the plane. When nearing San Francisco, the pilot and his flight attendants informed us that we were behind schedule by 25 minutes but he had informed the supervisor of our late arrival due to multiple passengers with tight connecting flights that were boarding while we were still in flight. Our flight landed at 10:17am. Due to the pilot landing at the wrong gate, we sat on the plane an additional 10 minutes before they finally allowed us to exit which was approximately 10:25a. Our connecting flight also with United Airlines allowed passengers to board between 10:15a and stopped boarding at 10:25a. Again, we were under the impression that our flight was being held for us. Upon approaching the gate, the 2 people at the gate and customer service desk were the absolute rudest and the most inconsiderate. They stated that they never got word from the pilot about our late arrival. They attempted to split my family (my husband, myself, and our 7yo son) apart to catch different flights then recanted and stated that they were full. Our son is competing in the USA National Karate Competition in Reno, NV and had to be checked in by 4pm. We explained that to them. Still no remorse or apology or anything. Instead, they attempted to book us for a 9:30p flight which we refused. The only thing left for us to do as parents was to rent a car and tackle the 4hr drive! Of course the rental was over priced because it was last minute and being dropped off in a different state! This whole experience was absolutely horrible!",-1
2018-07-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Kahului,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,experience was  utterly gross,True,"  My last experience with UA was just utterly gross. I sat in economy on the way from Chicago to Maui (9 hour flight) with no inflight entertainment, they do offer WiFi that you have to pay 35 bucks for if you want to use your computer and they offer a movie streaming service which you can use in your own personal device (you can’t use this on your phone unless you have the United airlines app which you can download but you’d have to do it before your flight because on the flight you have to pay the internet in order to download it from the App Store. For your computer, you have to install certain softwares in order to stream them from your laptop. They offer food that they charge you for because it’s the passengers responsibility if they get hungry on a 9 hour flight apparently. The seat was tiny with the smallest amount of leg room you can imagine. Luckily I sat in the aisle seat so I was able to stretch my legs out into the aisle from time to time but if I kept my legs out for to long: a flight attendant would walk by having no promo em stepping on you or “inadvertently” kicking you as they walk through without any contrition. The flight attendant (I dread calling them that because they seldomly attended) would make her way down the aisle with a tray of coffee or tea, run out by the time she got to row 10 and never attend to the people passed that point. Finally when she did make it to me with her cart (which was 15 minutes before landing) I asked if I could get a coffee and cranberry juice and she snarled at me with the response “ok I really have to keep it moving”. Overhead compartments was so small and people were playing a really tricky game of Tetris to make their stuff fit in. The electrical outlet was humongous so my charger for phone and computer kept falling out and the only way I could charge is if I physically held the charger in the outlet. The food that I ended up paying for was gross and cold and the bread was stale and difficult to chew. They put up a sheer curtain between first class and economy so that you’re teased by the huge personal TVs and vast space they have. Clearly a ploy so that you only buy first class tickets since the alternative is physically painful. The bathrooms had toilet paper all over the floor (clearly no one tends to them during the flight). The call lights I would press for the flight “attendant” were just promptly turned off without anyone swinging by to see if there was anything that I needed. Honestly, so many more issues to list, it was mortifying flying with UA and I really do not know how they are still in business when you compare thEm to other American airlines",-1

I understand that things happen but United seriously dropped the ball today. Every flight was over and hour late, over booked and hot! Worst customer service when trying to get a new flight due to a 108 minute delay on our first flight causing us to miss our connecting flight.

I’ve used United Airlines a lot this year (even flew from Florida to Hong Kong with them) and it has let me down every time. It has by far, the worst customer service. The staff is rude, super unhelpful and definitely not prepared. Absolutely every flight I’ve tried United has been delayed and I’ve had lost my connections. They never give updates on any information and when you ask for some they simply answer “they don’t know”. They do not care enough to help you fix things they just treat you like trash and relocate you, making it worse. Super awful experiences. I do not recommend United Airlines to anyone.",-1

The United airlines staff was very accommodating right from the moment we had to check in at Frankfurt. My son was given a priority tag on his wheelchair and consequently our whole family was treated the same way along with our son throughout. The guide stayed with us until we boarded the plane. The boarding counter lady was super nice and was really worried about getting us in first of all after the business class got in the plane. In the plane the flight attendants offered us every help possible and kept asking if my son is doing okay throughout. The lady attendant also brought my son a banana and some delicious chocolates, probably from the business class menu items. When we finally reached the destination not only we promptly received our son's wheelchair but also another special need helper was there with my sons name on an iPad displayed to guide us our way to the luggage carousel. I am super impressed they treated us throughout. We were a little hesitant to use the airline at first but now will use it over and over again.",1

Never in my life have I had a worse experience with an airline. My two flights from Houston to Manchester were both delayed by three hours, but that's not even the worst of it! My flight back from Manchester was delayed over 5 hours! It was so bad that I missed my connecting flight to Houston and had to wait an entire day for a returning flight. And just when I thought I might finally be able to go home, that flight was delayed three hours too. When we finally got on the plane it took another hour to actually take off! I missed all my plans for the day at home because I was waiting 29 hours for a returning flight, and I now hate United Airlines with a flaming passion. Whatever you do, never ever fly with United Airlines, it is a massive waste of precious time and money and the awful service is nowhere near worth it.",-1

However, on July 3 the storm would not let this plane landed, they had to fly to Boston instead. Although I had some difficulties but United did take care of me although they had many people to care for. They first gave $20 meal voucher, then after a few hours they could not find new plane, they booked me to a hotel and booked me through American Airline to fly me back from Boston to Dallas the next day. This is the first time I experienced this problem, but they did take care of us. I want to say thank you.",1

Wait but it’s not over getting home my flight ended up taking off late but I wasn’t surprised at all! Then getting to the airport my suitcase was put on the wrong airplane and I had to wait a hour and a half again. Overall experience was terrible and unless I can feel valued right about now I will never be riding with United and will recommend to anyone not to take that airline either.",-1
2018-07-08,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chattanooga to Portland via Newark,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3,dishonest to charge me,True," Flew roundtrip Chattanooga to Portland, ME I have not flown for several years, so prepared for challenges. Well, kudos to TSA recheck. Made security one big breeze. The plane in both directions were very small and had no overheads to accommodate the regulation size carryons which was included in my fare. Flying Economy Plus? Not sure, they have so many different levels depending on what a la cartes you picked! First the ticket agent in Chattanooga made me check my carry on and pay  $25. When got to gate the same agent gave everyone in boarding area baggage tags to check them for free on the jetway! Did file complaint with United and they have responded to my issue with a refund, so one plus for them. But, the agent, hopefully, will be reprimanded. It was dishonest to charge me and I did not realize till I boarded plane. Return flight, we got in early. They did not have bags in jetway as we deplaned! Instead, we waited 45 minutes after 11 PM for bags to enter carousel in baggage claim. Very exhausting that time of night. Why did they not make it convenient for us to grab as we got off plane? Overall, flying pinched inside a tiny seat with little leg room was awful. the plane was 57 degrees on return flight and stewardess said they were working on -  did finally begin to warm after 2 hours, just before landing. Did not partake of the free drinks and pretzels, so can't speak to snacks, seem crazy in short legs of flight. Would not look forward to flying again and booking online. Too many options you can pick from that just keep adding up and seem annoyingly presented on entire page to get you to spend more. Used to fly a lot, and will not miss it if never go again.",-1

Missed airport pickup, had to pay for another ride $28. Pilot said we were waiting for mechanics to come to tighten some bolts (I do not know if he was speaking seriously). Food on board not as described on menu: hamburger had no lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles as promised. As small as it was and served bare it was just like a 99c white castle hamburger. Seats comfortable and cabin crew kind and gentle. Agent at PSP kept trying to get money from me: first he claimed I'd have to remove 3 lbs b/c suitcase was 73 lbs. He had another bag on the scale. After removing it he said I was 1lb over and I said that 23 kilos is 51 lbs. He didn't care. Then insisted I pay $25 to check a suitcase even though was making an international connexion to one of their partners, but the swarthy 20-year old doesn't know what qualifies as a connexion. I couldn't convince him or his supervisor and they refused to call a ticketing expert. I was firm and insistent but because this supervisor told me I was rude (limited vocabulary), I paid the fine. I am constantly baffled that people who hate coming into contact with the public and who have no talent for customer service seem to be hired by United again and again.",-1

Agents don't know LGA and JFK are ""co-terminals"" in NYC and that an Intl connexion in North America is 12 hours. Although I was the only customer there they refused to call their international desk but instead called me ""rude"" because I was firm. I just paid the fine because I know the next step after they call you rude is to call a SWAT team to arrest you. This is usual customer service in 2018. They just want money and they want a lot of it.",-1

Every time I have flown United there has been delays. The weather is perfect both in my departing city and arriving city. There are no mechanical problems with the plane, but now we are sitting in the runway delayed for 1 hour. They give no explanation for the delay and no compensation Is provided. I am on a very small plane with only 3 seats in a row and no room for overhead storage. This airline should be ashamed.",-1
2018-07-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Chicago via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,first and last experience with them,True," Las Vegas to Chicago via Los Angeles. On a business trip. Aircraft were relatively old and nothing special about the crew or the flights. The problem occurred when was flying from ORD to NYC LaGuardia LGA flight was supposed to leave at 5pm suddenly flight got cancelled without further information except due to weather conditions. The 4pm flight is going ahead and the 6pm flight as well. To my surprise the 3pm, 5pm and 7pm flights are cancelled to NYC however the 4pm, 6pm and 8pm flights are normal operation. Then the chaos started tried to rebook myself on a standby for the 6pm flight didn’t work out checked with the United staff and they are probably deaf or not listening or helping not knowing where my luggage are or how to locate them or where to go. No one from the ground staff is helping and all they say it’s due to weather we can’t help you and there’s no further flights to NYC till tomorrow afternoon while I have to attend an important meeting at 8:30AM. This situation was just a joke. Eventually located my luggage which already been sent to LGA on the 6pm flight which I don’t understand how would they send luggage without the passenger being on board the flight and had to queue with my colleague for almost 2 hours to rebook ourselves. When we reached the counter the only option the clerk gave us was to rebook to Hartford which is 2 hrs away from NYC we had to accept that and sort ourselves from Hartford then that particular flight got delayed which makes it arrive in Hartford at 3am which impossible for us to find our way to NYC. Eventually we booked ourselves on a different airline and paid 500 USD each for a one way ticket from Chicago to New York City. Seriously the most unorganised airline in the world. Later on we discovered that they had a system failure and that’s why they couldn’t operate certain flights but to avoid compensating passengers or booking hotels for them they delcraed it’s due to weather. Will never fly with this airline ever again. It’s the first and last experience with them.",-1
2018-07-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Houston,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,"expensive, dated, unfair",True," Fort Lauderdale to Houston. Somehow United managed to turn from one of the best airlines in the US into the worst. Dated website and check-in portal that looks like it was developed in the 90s and has not been changed since then (especially the online check-in), non-transparent seating assignment for basic economy; I somehow end up at the very end of the plane almost every flight and sometimes separated from other family/friends on the same itinerary, despite early check-ins. Anyone from United can explain that? The airline has a low grade low-coster feel to it - old planes and dated looking everything. Did I mention the prices.... the ridiculous prices they charge for everything - even for basic economy airfare? Well there is a flex-economy, and a premium economy, and maybe an economy plus and economy XL to be added sometimes soon, but don't be optimistic with the names of tariffs. The price for airfare is ridiculously expensive, especially if you are based in Houston and out of luck as you don't have access to other airlines (United must be lobbying this very hard). Even the most basic economy option is way too expensive for domestic flights, especially if you want to pack up a swimming suite with you in a small suitcase as there comes the baggage fees, extra baggage fees if you take your small checked suitcase on board, pay if you want to sit next to the isle or window, or your family member, pay for obsolete entertainment options: lack of free wifi yet extremely slow if you finally decide to swipe your card for it. My favorite - pay if you want to watch Direct-TV on a contrast lacking micro-screen in front of you - a paid streaming TV on board of a plane - You. Must. Be. Kidding. Me! Culmination of this ""entertainment"" system happened on my recent night flight from Houston to Miami. The system glitched completely and was stuck in startup loop during the whole flight blasting that 100% brightness Direct-TV logo on and off (in my face!) the whole night without possibility to turn that screen off. Now to the meals and snacks! - What snacks!? - Ah the mini-pretzels and and that is it. At least soda and the lavatories are free for now! I have flown many airlines, and can confidently say that Easyjet, Southwest, AA and Delta are all better airlines then United, by all means - price, comfort, entertainment, convenience and transparency and fairness to its clients. How come I am able to fly between Miami, Vegas, LA and NY for 200-300$ with other airlines but it costs me at least 300$ to fly to the nearest major destination out of Houston, which most of the time is half the distance of the above-mentioned flights? How come low-costers in Europe can get you from Norway to Spain round-trip for 100$ while this behemoth is crying going out of business if they lower the prices. Unfortunately I am currently based in Houston and don't have much access to other airlines due to long lasting monopoly of this company on the local market so have to unwillingly stick to it. On the positive side I can mention ground and cabin crew. These folks are always welcoming. I used to like United Airlines back in the days, but if today you ask me to characterize and summarize this airline in 4 words, those words would be: expensive, dated, unfair and non-transparent.",-1
2018-07-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Chicago,2.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,1.0,2,they give you nothing,True," This is the worst airline, I thought it was Spirit but no its United Airlines. I flew basic economy and they give you nothing. If you do not pay for a bag you get treat like a third class citizen. I was not allowed to check in online I had to go to the airport to check in and then see an agent so she could check my bag to make sure it wasn't too large to fit in the small box. I asked for assistance, the agent was very rude, she never came to help I had to figure things out myself and then on top of that I still didnt even get an assigned seat. After checking in you have to go to the to the gate and let the agent give you a seat after everyone else is assigned, this is only one step above standby. Everyone was scattered throughout the plane and no one was sitting with their family, people had to switch seats on their own. I paid for a checked bag for my wife and her bag never made it into the plane. We were told that they would have to deliver it. We arrive oh are at 7.30am and the bag wouldn't be delivered until after 2.30pm. We had to contact her doctor to call in her prescription to the pharmacy because it was in her bag.",-1

2018-07-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,will never fly United again,False," Buffalo to Chicago. Terrible is not even close to how bad this airline is. To begin, my flight here was delayed a full hour. Now my flight was cancelled last minute and after trying to contact the company they said our only option was to travel back home 2 days after  our scheduled date. We asked about stand by and they said there was no way we could do stand by because the flights were completely booked. First of all that's a lie. Then they said they'd be able to get us on separate flights one at 11am and the other at 550 the next day. So we accepted since it's better than waiting 2 days. we decided to go to the airport an hour after talking on the phone since we weren't near the airport at that time and the man on the counter said we were able to get on a flight that same night which was the flight after the one we were scheduled to get on but since the other lady had already booked our separate flights it was no longer an option. So already beyond annoyed at this point. My friend then goes to the airport at 8am the next day for his 11am flight and they tell him that there's plenty available space on the 830am flight!  How was this not mentioned the day before. He barely made it to the 830am flight and then I decided to head to the airport straight after to see if I can get on the next flight home. They finally allowed me to do standby but 2 flights later still no space according to them. I am missing work and important meetings because employees don't care about their customers. I will never fly United again.",-1

Actually the cabin staff were great, but there is no support of the company if the flight got delayed and you end up losing your transfer! I am now in Washington airport and I need to wait for one day, my flight in Beijing delayed for 2 hours, and consequently I lost my flight to Brazil, the company gave me no help, no place to stay overnight, only gave me a coupon that I could call a number so I could get discount for a hotel. I called the number and there was no available room, they gave me two choices: or you call the number and stay in a hotel or you spend the night inside the airport. Which kind of airline company does that? I unfortunately wouldn't recommend this airline due to this issues.",-1

We (group of 6) booked our flight 6 months ago. In that time our flight has been changed 4 times. A little over a week ago our flight was changed again and we called the airline to make sure that we would make it to our connection in time; we were assured that we would. Yesterday, halfway through our vacation, they changed our flights again. Now we are not on the same airplane and don’t have seats together and United are claiming they “cannot” upgrade us to economy plus so that we can all be together without charging us extra money even though our flight situation is all due to their screwup; they put us on a flight which they claim is illegal due to the narrow connection time being impossible to make. My family is done taking United flights and we are closing our United credit cards; this airline has gone so downhill it is in no way worth the cost.",-1

I am a 1k premier member only due to business travel. United has the absolute worst customer care in the industry. A result of grossly deficient leadership in the corporate office, where accountability is a foreign concept. I feel for those United employees that truly do care and try to help customers. I fly approximately 25 flights a year with United. 70% are delayed or I experience an issue. I dream of the day when I no longer have to board another United flight. It is very sad to see what United has done to a once proud and enjoyable carrier called Continental. I have attached a picture of the customer care counter where four agents were available despite 13 kiosks.",-1

We booked basic economy on orbitz and we did not know this had no carry on and we had a 6 month old baby. They made us feel terrible because we asked to take one carry on which had the baby stuff.

The return is via United and I am not at all happy with the business class cabin. I’m in an inside seat with a row of four. I’m 6’2” and I’m not able to lay in this park bench seat.

The flight was operated by a B737 and did not have flatbeds in the premium cabin, but the seats were comfortable enough to sleep during the flight. The crew was very nice and greeted us with an Aloha. As probably everybody else on the plane we were on vacation and everybody on the aircraft was in a good mood. The service and the crew were perfect and I enjoyed my salmon. The departure was punctual and everything was to our satisfaction.

My wife broke her hip in Jerusalem requiring a hospital stay and an immediate return to Kansas as well as a cancelling of vacation stopovers in Athens and Germany. United charged us an additional $9500 which was approximately the same as what we prepaid for both of our First Class tickets. They would not bargain, at all. As my wife was in great pain and an immediate return to the US was needed I had no choice. I contacted United upon my return to no avail. United is now my last choice for flying overseas. We are returning to Europe soon and have friends there. We always will fly First Class, just not with United.",-1
2018-06-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via San Francisco,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2,an absolute nightmare,True,"  Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via San Francisco. It was a rough trip flying back home to Pittsburgh. My family and I woke up bright and early at 4am to avoid LA traffic. Our flight was originally around 6-7am but then I was notified of a delay. Because we had a layover, we would not make our second flight home. I had to change my flight last minute which was fine because we were only maybe an hour behind schedule. My family and I were finally on our first flight and I was getting ready to sleep for the next 5 hours before landing in DC. I believe it was the autopilot who came on to talk about how they were having issues with the plane but he assured us that they are working on it. First they had the maintenance people come, then there was something about paperwork needing to be signed and finally, the autopilot mentioned that the gas was in the wrong area or chamber. I've sat on this plane for maybe an hour and half and now I'm rushing to call customer service to get me on the next flight ASAP because the flight was cancelled. Apparantly, the next two flight to SF was booked but my family of 3 can be waitlisted in case someone canceled. Did I mention that one man was absolutely going nuts when we all got off the plane? He mentioned something about his brother is on life support. There was also a huge line of people waiting to be waitlisted. However, I manage to book a flight for 12:58pm. At this point, my family and I have been at the airport for 7 hours. Finally, we get on the 12:58pm plane and we land in DC on time for our flight to Pittsburgh. It was storming on and off while on the first plane with plenty of turbulance. We were also delayed on the second flight! I thought they were going cancel our flight due to weather but they didn't and we did manage to get to Pittsburgh around 11-12pm. United Airline actually gave my family $300 for our next flight but the chances of us flying ever again is slim. This whole trip was an absolute nightmare with the delays and cancellation. On top of that, sitting in economy class is the most uncomfortable place to be. Honestly, take some advice from people who make genuinely comfortable lounge chairs with cushions in it please. There was absolutely no support at all and no room on the plane. The only good thing about the flights was that I was given free apple juice. I will never fly again if I can avoid it.",-1

The flight was supposed to depart at 10:30pm and it’s delayed for 7 hours. It’s worst of all worst airlines. We were not given any food/water and place to stay. I have decided not to fly through united irrespective of the cost.,-1
2018-06-29,0.3,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Melbourne,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2,Service was non existent,False,"  Los Angeles to Melbourne. United just don't get it despite what their competition is doing. I've just paid over $8,000 for a business class ticket return Melbourne Los Angeles and get asked to pay for ""premium"" scotch in their new lounge. We're not talking about top shelf scotch either - try standard 10 yr Glenfiddich at about $50/bottle. For free one can have some bottom of the rung local bourbon. United don't seem to function with anything other than a penny wise, pound foolish philosophy. I am looking forward to booking with Virgin Australia or Qantas for my next similar flight. On the flight over I was underwhelmed by the cramped business class capsule. The seat was comfortable but I'm slim. And I felt that I just fitted into the seat width. Service was non existent. Had to ring the service buzzer twice for water. Never handed out bottles when lights go out like other airlines. Neither did they go around asking selfish passengers to close their window blind when most were trying to sleep with daylight outside. On a 14 hr flight this is detrimental to all the other passengers wellbeing as it made it hard to sleep. There is basically no storage in the capsule in front of one, or to the side. The limited storage is behind and to the side, right where all the cables for headphones and chargers sit. Their business class cabin looks cheap. It is serviced like a cheap budget airline. But they know how to charge like a premier airline. They can't even offer a business class passenger before departing on a 15 hour flight a free scotch. Except you can have a very cheap bourbon. Cheap seems to be their mantra.",-1
2018-06-29,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Newark,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,left luggage outside my building,True,"  I was scheduled to fly from Washington DC (IAD) to Newark (EWR) with United Airlines and then continue via SAS from EWR to Copenhagen. Due to weather issues in the greater NY area the United flight was delayed by 6 hours and my connecting flight had left when I arrived at EWR. At IAD I had explained to United agents that my luggage was checked in all the way to Copenhagen, and that I needed guidance regarding if/how/where I needed to pick up my luggage when arriving in EWR. I was simply told to explain my situation to United agents when arriving at EWR. Following guidance from the United flight crew I stood in line for two hours to speak to a United agent at the United EWR customer care booth located next to my arrival gate. When I finally talked to an agent I was asked to go to the United baggage claim booth. After having waited another hour the United baggage claim agent informed me that she had located the luggage, but that I had to wait at least another 5 hours for my bag to be brought to the United baggage claim area. I was then told to show up 8.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage (*note that after arriving at EWR Scandinavian Airlines had manage to re-book me via American Airlines to go to Miami and then via a SAS flight to Copenhagen). By the time United told me to leave without my luggage it was 12.30 AM in the night – 12.5 hours after departing IAD airport. I was offered no hotel options. After having spent 35 min a cab to reach a friend’s apartment in NYC I spent another 30 min in a cab ($150 out of pocket) and returned to EWR 7.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage. A third United agent then told me that they could not locate my luggage in their system and that it likely was with SAS. I was then told that since the SAS office only opens 9 AM the right thing would have been to wait the five hours the previous night. This conversation took 30 secs and it was made very clear that this was not United problem and that I was advised to board my American Airlines flight without my luggage and file a lost luggage complaint with SAS upon arriving in Copenhagen, which I then did. I arrived in Copenhagen 8 am and had to continue straight to my air-bnb and then to the university. At this point I had slept 2-3 hours since my departure at Dulles on the 19th (2 days ago) and I had no new clothes to change into. Upon returning to IAD from Copenhagen on June 24th I still had not received my luggage. After being passed from one United agent to another at IAD I was told that my luggage was at EWR. I filed a lost luggage complaint with United and since received around 10 text messages saying that my luggage was not located. Early morning 12.39 AM on June 27th, while asleep, I get a text by a private company contracted by United stating that they are “attempting to deliver my luggage” and I am asked to call/text to confirm my address. 6.02 AM I write back to confirm my address and I text the private agent to call me before dropping off my luggage. I leave my apartment 6.40 AM only to discover that the private agent had left my luggage outside my building without notifying me.",-1
2018-06-29,0.2,Business,Business Class,Washington to Frankfurt,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,inferior International service,True,"  Washington to Frankfurt. United Airlines continues to disappoint, which is why I have not flown them on an International flight for 4+ years. Was attracted by the ""hype"" of the new Polaris service, but it is much-ado-about-nothing. IAH President's Club is a joke. The beer & wine selection is limited to 1 or 2, or they want to charge $9 for a drink - nice touch after you have paid $5,000+ for a ticket. Food offerings consisted of some trail mix, some cold veggies & some soup. How United believe they can compete with this type of inferior International service is lost on me. No United Execs have apparently never flown on the International competition, or they would be embarrassed to hype Polaris. Flight attendant came around 1 time during the 1st hour of the flight - once. I had a glass of red wine, but when she returned for her 2nd visit, she announced they had already ran out of red wine for the remainder of the flight. This fairly well sums up the entire United approach to their International business class product. Won't fly them for another 4 years.",-1

Further underscores why I never fly United for my International trips, and rarely fly them domestically. The only consistency with UAL is their continuing ability to disappoint. Both in equipment and service delivery. Even if you have a 1st class ticket it does not gain you entry to the UA Club Lounge, but that is no big loss, since UA's lounges are below mediocre at best. United, like American and Delta, are the best sales promotion tools that International airlines have.",-1

My flight departed from Terminal 2, which was a nice and quiet terminal without the regular airport hassle. There was no line at check-in and no line at security control. My flight was early in the morning and I had a light breakfast at the United Club. Interestingly enough, UA operates their won lounge at Phoenix: Staff was nice and the food offerings more than sufficient. It was a nice and calm lounge and the staff was very friendly. Even though it was before noon, the bar was already open and I had a drink or two. Boarding process at the gate was on time and professional, with us boarding in our boarding groups. The flight was good and the Economy Plus seat was comfortable and offered enough space. The A319 was stylish and had leather seats, Wifi and personal entertainment. Friendly crew, tasty food. I cannot complain and would choose United again.",1

Boarding was punctual and efficient.  I slept almost the entire flight. A friendly flight attendant woke me up for dinner to check if I would need anything. Whenever I woke up a couple times during the flight I saw that my empty water bottle had been replaced by a fresh one. I missed the ice cream but the flight attendant had reserved a cup for my breakfast. Seat was comfortable enough. I just used the TV the last hour before landing but the variety of programs is good. All in all a good flight with a friendly crew. I recommend United Airlines.,1

2018-06-27,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Tucson to Cleveland via Chicago,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,poor customer service experience,True,"  After a recent business trip to Tucson, my coworker and I received the worst customer service from not one, but two United representatives. We arrived at the Tucson airport about an hour and a half early and while we were heading to our gate we received a push notification that the flight was delayed so we went and grabbed food, and set up at a charging station a few gates down. When it was getting close to the time that we would need to start boarding, we walked over to the gate and found out that the flight left at its scheduled time. No updates, no announcement for boarding, nothing. The woman at the gate laughed it off saying that when the pilot wants to leave the pilot leaves. With no more flights leaving from Tucson that day on United, we were infuriated. The woman was not empathetic, wouldn’t look us in the eyes, and gave us no other options but to stay in Tucson (not comped by United, mind you) and arrive to Cleveland at 3pm the next day. We called the customer service line and the representative literally said “I don’t understand why you weren’t at your gate, you should have been there”. After he also unempathetically didn’t even try to help us, I asked to speak to a manager. I’m pretty sure I spoke to the same guy who just changed his voice into a higher pitched tone. He said the same and wouldn’t even give me a refund, gave me a hard time about missing the flight and said that he knows that they make courtesy announcements before taking off. Apparently you don’t, or I wouldn’t have been stranded in Tucson. After finally calling again and speaking to a much nicer woman, we were able to get a partial refund and bought tickets on American Airlines flying just a few hours later. I’ve never had such a poor customer service experience in my life and will never fly with United again unless absolutely necessary. Taking my business elsewhere!",-1
2018-06-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Amsterdam via Chicago,,,,,,1.0,1,Absolutely terrible service,True,"  Absolutely terrible service and we will never be flying with you guys ever again. We called the night before to make sure everything was okay with the flight and it was. However, when we get to the airport which is 2 hours away from where we live we get a call once we are at the airport that the flight was cancelled. So, we think that we will just be getting on another flight so we will still be able to get to our destination that day. We stood in line to check in for about 35 minutes and then the person there, after failing to put in our confrontation code 3 times, told us that our flight has been rescheduled for tomorrow and that we might not even be able to get on that flight. I’m really disappointed in United Airlines in their lack of communication. We weren’t even told why the flight was canceled. They wasted our time and lost our business. Not that they truly care but my mother’s family who were suppose to pick her up took the day off work and my mother, who hasn’t seen her family for many years now, is forced to go back home and wait because United Airlines can’t get their priority’s straight. Your customers should be your main priority and clearly they aren’t.",-1

There were multiple maintenance issues - 2 on one layover at Denver, and 1 in chicago. The Chicago flight we ended up turning around due to hydraulics issues which caused us to miss our connecting flight. There were no agents at the gate to help us find a new flight so we had to call. The first time we called they hung up on us. All in all we were almost 7 hours late to our destination. I'm guessing they aren't using great planes if they had that many issues and awful customer service. Will not recommend to anyone.",-1
2018-06-26,0.8,Business,Premium Economy,Chicago to Phoenix,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,the seat was comfortable,True,"  Chicago to Phoenix. Due to a mechanical issue the airplane was delayed and we sat on the plane for 30-45 minutes. While I would have preferred an ontime arrival, delays can happen. The crew was very professional and served snacks and water and informed us continuously and the doors were reopened just in case somebody wanted to leave the aircraft. United proactively rebooked me on a later flight just in case the issue would not have been fixed. In the end we did depart with a delay. The rest of the flight was uneventful. I was flying Economy Plus and the seat was comfortable and offered enough legspace. United Economy Plus is the same seat and same onboard service as it is in regular Economy but with some inches of more legspace. I just flew with a different us carrier in the Premium Economy Class/Comfort Plus class and they also offer a free alcoholic drink and a premium snack in the Economy Plus section. United should do the same thing and upgrade the Economy Plus section.",1

Terrible customer service. My plane way delayed for 5 hours because they were waiting for another plane to arrive. This caused many of us to miss our connecting flights, and minimal information was given. They did nothing to make this situation better for their customers. No company should be able to treat paying customers like this.",-1

From now on I will always pay more to avoid this airline. I’ve flown twice in the last month with United and both times were absolute terrible experiences. Long delays with minimal information provided as to why. You can’t bring a carry on if you’re flying basic economy class but they don’t have a good system for keeping track of baggage apparently because they managed to lose mine on a 45 minute direct flight. Pay extra to fly a different airline because this is trash.,-1
2018-06-24,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Providenciales to Denver,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,such terrible service,True,"  I’m a small business owner, and if I treated my customers the way United Airlines treats their customers I would be out of business. I spent $2800 to fly my family to Turks and Caicos from Denver. United Airlines changed the aircraft and even though I booked our flights over a year ago, they separated our family all throughout the aircraft. Our children had to enter the aircraft on the back and we had to enter the aircraft on the front. This was on our way back home. When we connected through Houston I noticed that my luggage was damaged. So I have a three hour layover in Houston and I figured I would go and talk to baggage services, as I did not want to handle it when I arrive in Denver at 11:30 at night. I mean why not handle it at a normal time of day when I have three hours to kill, but the person working the United baggage service tells me she can’t do a claim for me and it must be done at my final destination. When I asked why couldn’t it just be handled right now she said that is United Airlines policy. I’m sorry, but when your policy causes agitation to a customer, and you have no explanation besides it’s your policy then that is something that should be changed. I found it comical that United airlines employee tells me that I need to post on social media about how negative my experience was. I doubt that will do any good.

My plane was delayed 4 hours in San Francisco the was my only first stop I was going to have. The plane was so supposed to go at 9:40 which never happened they change our time to 10:30 then to 11:15 then to 12:30 we end up leaving from San Francisco at 2:00 in the morning. The worst thing the ever happened to me I was flying with my kids and my self of course my kids fell to sleep waiting in the airport when they started to call everyone to get ready to go in to the airplane I ask the lady in the front desk the I need it help to get my 3 year old and my 7 year old out of the chair we’re they were sleeping, she went and ask her manager and the manager came and told me I can’t help you,you going to have to wake them up. While we were in line one lady the was going to bord with us was checking the depart screen she said our fly was delayed by 4 hours and on the screen it says the this fly the leaves at 2:00 am it’s on time ugh even worst we waited for more people so they could have there plane full so they wouldn’t have to use 2 planes.

Initially it was only delayed 2 hours then when everyone got on the plane we had to sit there for 2 more hours before they finally announced that the plane is broken. By that point it was 12:30 AM. Then we waited for a new plane, which arrived but the crew has left already so they delayed it until 11:00 AM until the next morning. They did not provide a hotel, did not provide an alternative earlier flight, and refused to give a refund.",-1
2018-06-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Lafayette to Tulsa,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,10 hours in airports,True,"  We arrived at 10 A.M. for a 12 am flight because that’s what you are told to do. We get to the airport only to find out it’s delayed for a little over an hour. No big deal we can still make our connecting flight well of corse not they delayed it another 30 min. We miss our connecting flight they can’t get us on another flor 4 hours. (9 hours) then that flight is delayed another hour. So 10 hours in airports to go to a place that would have taken me 8 hours to drive to. If I fly a discounted airline I expect this type of service because you get what you pay for but United although gives cut rate service their prices are not cut rate. Then I paid for upgraded seats but they said that didn’t matter anymore. This is the fourth time in a row flying United and having major issues. I can care less about food, chairs or even the way the flight crew treats passengers but don’t charge me to get to a destination that I could have driven to in a lot less time. I will be asking for some money back. Not a voucher either because I will never take united again unlesss I have a sudden urge to spend a whole day in the airport. Their employees in the Houston airport are not nice which is probably because they are tired of coming up with excuses for their employers lack of management or leadership. I can’t even rate value for your money because they should pay me for my whole wasted day.",-1
2018-06-22,0.1,Business,Business Class,Hong Kong to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,choose any other airline,False,"  I have always thought that United is the worst, but for some unknown reason, I keep giving it another chance. I am currently sitting on a boarded plane that is delayed by six hours, and we have just been told that because of the massive delays, the crew can no longer fly us directly to Newark. We now will be going to San Fran in between. Oh and no one on board knows when we will actually take off. According to multiple flight attendants, there are no updates? So, we are stuck here on the plane with no options, no plan for leaving, and a required additional stop that was unplanned. United should take a hard look at airlines like EVA and Cathay, and learn a thing or two. It's shameful to pay for such abysmal service. Please do yourself a favor and choose any other airline.",-1
2018-06-22,0.4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orange County,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,a gross experience,False,"  Newark to Orange County. What a gross experience. The aisle was way too tiny to pass even for someone who is very petite making going to the filthy bathroom a chore. I had to go back to my seat in order for the snack cart to pass by. The economy plus really was a minus because we still didn't have ample leg space. What happened to the barf bags (just in case someone got sick) and the blankets and pillows? I think that we were overcharged for baggage. The aircraft loads by groups. We were in group 2. A fellow and his daughter, who were in group 4, got on the group 2 line. When he got to the gate, the attendant told him that he was in the wrong group but she would let me board ""this time."" He had 3 rolling cases plus a large backpack. The flight instructions specifically say ""only one rolling case allowed per person"". He was allowed to bring all 4 cases on the aircraft while people boarding in later groups had to check their carry on bag due to lack of room.",-1
2018-06-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,ground service is really bad,True,"  The ground service is really bad. I was on the flight from Denver to San Francisco via United Airlines, and was going to connect to another international flight. However, the flight from DEN to SFO delayed an hour and half, which made me only 30 minutes to get to my connection. Right after I got off the plane, I asked the ground service to give me a delay certificate, and they told me they didn’t have, and said that I should have asked when I was in DEN, but I was stuck on the plane for almost an hour, who can I ask for a delay certificate? The ground staff didn’t do the job well. They were supposed to know the situation of the flight and assist the passengers. When a flight delayed for an hour and half, they should have prepared delay certificates or at least told the passengers where to get the certificates. In the end, I ran to catch my coming flight and made it, but my luggage didn’t. It seems like United Airlines doesn’t care about their passengers if they can’t catch their connections.",-1
2018-06-21,0.7,Business,Premium Economy,Washington Dulles to Philadelphia,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3,a job well done,True," Washington Dulles to Philadelphia. This flight was delayed almost 3 hours because it originated in Orlando and they could not take off due to severe weather. I must mention that the airport staff once we were notified of the delay immediately brought plenty of water and snacks to distribute to all of us that we’re waiting and kept everyone informed with PA announcements and the gentleman at the desk was extremely patient answering every single question from all who came up to him. It really looks like United is trying to do the right thing. Once the aircraft arrived the flight lasted under an hour, we quickly boarded the aircraft and no time we had taken off and landed in Philadelphia. Kudos to United for a job well done!",1

Usually on an international flight you get the better crew, everyone was very friendly, polite, and genuinely happy. The airplane looked and felt old, the screen to watch movies was a little bit larger than my iPhone X however the entertainment options were very good. On this 7.5 hour flight I was served one hot meal, one hot snack, a small snack, and unlimited beverages. One flight attendant was extremely nice to me and even brought me two ice cream’s. I upgraded to economy plus for around $200 and the only thing you get is more leg room. The seat is the same as in the regular economy cabin and the service is the same. The Internet I thought was very expensive around $30 for the entire flight so I passed on that option however I would definitely fly United again. Good job United it looks like you’re trying to fix your reputation!",1

Bad experience through out the journey with United Airlines: We booked the tickets with the infant who is going to sit in my lap. His name was not included in the boarding pass and we had to suffer standing in the long waiting lines. It's just common sense that when you give us an option to online check in, and we use it that means we want to avoid standing in lines. Since we are travelling with an infant on lap, and the flight had to start with 1 hr delay and we were on the runway, we asked if they can help me with something to keep my baby's milk fresh, they gave us the airsick bag full of ice for which I was happy, but unfortunately the bag was not water proof (not plastic, it was paper bag). We did not knew this and all our other bags became wet as the ice melted. This is a 5 hr 41 min flight, which means passengers expect some food on the flight. The male attendant was not at all cooperative with me or any of the passengers around me. I don't understand why they have a menu with 5 or 6 pages with different types of food options.May be they are using the same menu across all their domestic and international flights to save money from printing different menu cards for different routes. All over we had a very bad experience with United airlines and definitely will not take the flights nor recommend to anyone.",-1

They forced me to check a small backpack for no reason other than I had a purse on me which they counted as another personal item.

After flying BA and AA on this route I can safely say United Airlines is the worst airline. Certainly not the friendly skies! Food was poor. Aircrew were by comparison unattractive. Basically, after looking forward to flying on the Dreamliner, the way united have configured the plane and the service ruined my experience. Although leg room was fine, the seat width is dire. Also insisting on dimming the windows after lunch on a daytime flight with a daytime arrival at the destination is just plain dumb. If you have a choice, fly AA. I won't be choosing United for my next flight at all costs.",-1

Worst trip ever. This was a nearly 6 hour overnight flight to Trinidad. We paid for extra leg room and got an additional 2 inches. No food was offered except a small bag of pretzels or small packages of food for fee. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable and some genius designed them so the controls for the video screen are on the top of the arm rest where most people put their elbows. My neighbor unintentionally reset the video throughout the trip. The video flashes endless ads for paid streaming access while you're trying to sleep. Even once I figured out how to turn it off my neighbor's elbow would turn it back on again. Who thought this was a good design idea? Finally, no pillows are offered and the courtesy ""blanket"" more closely resembled an oversized tea towel than a blanket.",-1

United Airlines cancelled my return flight from Chicago to Columbia without any notice due to ""operational difficulties."" Ok, fine. Something occurred that may have been out of their control. Their response, however, was very poor in my opinion. I needed to change my flight into STL and rent a car to get to Columbia. This cost me an extra 170, plus gas.

Our flight out of Aspen was delayed due to rain, which is normally for an Aspen Denver flight, however every person on the flight had tight connecting flights. The crew knowing many passengers needed to get off, would not open the door off the plane for 22 minutes. After majority of the passengers now need to run to the other side of Denver Terminal B (and for those who don’t know that’s close to a mile) we are told our plane will be waiting for our bags to be put on before take off. They were not. Not even put on the next flight, they will be arriving two days after our arrival. United so kindly asked us to pay for their drop off as well. Aside from incompetence, the aircraft themselves have abominable service, we flew first class and were served Mac and cheese as adults.",-1
2018-06-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Honolulu via Houston,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,They do not care,True,"  I strongly caution against flying United Airlines. They do not care about their customers, their customer's time, nor their money. On May 21, 2018, the United Airlines flight was canceled for 4 passengers, in which my husband and I had purchased all four tickets. This was the worst travel experience that I have encountered. The customer service of United Airlines is at most, deplorable. To begin, the flight that was canceled on 5/21/18 from BNA to IAH was canceled due to weather conditions that were non-existent. The cancellation was only reported 3-4 hours before the flight was set to take off. This placed us in a compromising position as we had a connecting flight to Honolulu (HNL) from Houston (IAH), the only flight for this destination, for that day. We had to scramble to find a nearby flight from Hunstville, AL, which is two hours away from where we reside. We attempted to call a United Airlines representative to help us find seats for all four passengers, but we were unsuccessful. My husband and I were the only couple that could fly from Huntsville into Houston and then into HNL. The other couple was forced to fly from Huntsville, to Denver, to San Francisco, to Los Angeles, and then to Honolulu. The customer service that we received over the phone from the representative was atrocious. The representative was ignorant when giving information on the flights, she rudely retorted comments back that reflected her ignorance, and due to her procrastination our travel plans were further delayed. We had to drive to the HSV airport and leave our car in long term parking. All of these incidents incurred an extra expense, for which should be compensated for by United Airlines. All we received was a measly flight credit of $75.00 for my husband and I and we purchased four tickets!",-1

Absolutely the worst organization I've ever experienced, and I've been flying since I was 3 months old (24+ yrs). Every trip in the past 2 years has either been delayed or cancelled there's no point in even making a reservation because we end up renting a car and driving 8 hours anyway with little to no compensation for the flight. Have had multiple bags lost or 'misplaced'. I don't know how they can even keep business. Imagine if this was a 400$ hotel room and you get there to find your room isn't ready for 6 hours and they over booked so you have to stay in a budget hotel anyways, just ridiculous; meanwhile the executives are taking home million $ bonuses chartering private planes cause they don't even want to fly on their own airline. I feel bad for the employees who have to deal with all the customer service bs while they are just trying to do their job. The only positive thing I have to say is that the employees do try and are nice a majority of the time so please don't make it hard on them.",-1

Flight was delayed because of mechanical problems and we were stuck for an hour and a half extra on the plane before departure. Then another hour after landing waiting on a gate on the other side of the airport and most everyone missed their connecting flights. Our connecting flight was then delayed again another hour and when we finally  arrived, we were stuck in a foreign country without our luggage because it “didn’t make our flight”. We had to call multiple times to get our luggage delivered. Will not fly again.",-1

When I got to the airport to drop off my bag (after self check in) it took 25 minutes for them to put a sticker on my bag and put it on the belt and I was the first one in line. There were only 3 people working and very long lines and wait times. When I got to the gate to fly out I heard that I would miss my connecting flight I went to talk to gate agents to see what my options are. They were not very helpful the only thing they did was rebook my on a flight for the morning and told me I’d have to figure out my plans once I was in Houston. They were condescending and blaming everything on policy. When I got to Houston, the customer service agents there were very helpful in getting me a room and other accommodations. But when I went to receive my checked bag for the night in the hotel, I was told that I was unable to get the bag and couldn’t have access to it til tomorrow. United is the worst airline I have flown, regarding everything from check in to reliability. At the Nashville airport there were 9 total delayed flights and 8 of them were United. I’ve also heard from several other guests that this is a common occurrence and had happened to them earlier this week. United needs some serious change in their operations as well as retraining employees.",-1
2018-06-15,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Sacramento to San Francisco,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,I will avoid flying this airline,True,"  I booked my flight along with my husbands flight 9 months in advance. The day before my flight I discovered I was only getting one boarding pass. My husbands flight booking was under a different conf #. This would be fine however the united miles plus card no longer applies to him, therefore he looses priority boarding AND United took it upon them selves to change our seating assignments to where we were no longer seated next to each other for 14 hr flights. I have never had my seating changed by any airline after choosing a seating assignment if they ""cant be guaranteed"" there is no advantage flying United over Southwest aside from paying more money. They had availability to accommodate to economy plus but of course wanted more money. we had to change flights adding a 4 hour layover and pickup arrangements just to sit next to each other. No wonder United ranks so poorly in customer service. I will avoid flying this airline at all costs in the future, its more important to try and suck another $300 out of a customer than accommodate and make it right. I will also be canceling my United Plus card as it serves no benefits. It does us no good to travel together if only one person on the card gets priority. I was on the phone for over an hour and 30 min with costumer service that is a joke. My time is money but obviously United does not care about that.",-1

United has a dedicated check-in area in Frankfurt, with dedicated counters for premium cabins and frequent travellers. The check-in is operated by trained Lufthansa agents and was quick, friendly and easy. Thanks to our UA status we were allowed into the Lufthansa Senator lounge at Frankfurt airport and enjoyed our pre-boarding snack and drinks. I love United´s unique and efficient boarding process. We were seated in the Economy Plus section and had plenty of legspace. The food in Economy is okay, snacks were served throughout the flight and wine and beer is available in all travel classes for free. The staff was very nice and the flight was enjoyable. Good selection of movies, internet and power outlets are available. Condition of the airplane very good (well, the B747 is retired now and it’s the new 777). Overall a very pleasant flight with on-time arrival in San Francisco.",1
2018-06-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never flying United again,False,"  Las Vegas to Newark. So they waited until 30 minutes before boarding to tell us about a 3 hour delay. After this delay, they let us board. After letting everyone get boarded and situated, they announce another hour delay. Instead of waiting another hour to board, they packed us in like sardines and continued to delay the plane. I understand delays are our of their control, but tell us as you find out. Dont trick us into being stuck on the flight. Nothing was added for a 5 hour delay, 2 of which were spent on the plane, sitting still at the gate. We paid for a flight that leaves at 11:15am. So, if you can't accommodate me, let me know. Don't drag me along. Get better at organizing flights before you have a whole company that screws over thousands of people. Never flying United again.",-1

Absolutely terrible service. The employees in Mexico spoke better English then all but one person I encountered in San Francisco. Was told the incorrect gate multiple times causing my pregnant wife to have to trek from one end of the terminal to the other. Smallest amount of legroom yet and the leather seats are awful.,-1
2018-06-12,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Detroit,,,,,,1.0,1,not be flying with them again,False,  This has been the most inconvienent experience I have been through. The customer service was extremely difficult and did not provide any help whatsoever. I was sent back and forth across the airport to talk to different people and every worker I encountered was horrendously rude and inconsiderate to my situation. My original flight had been cancelled and I was informed that I may not be able to catch another flight for three days and that they would not be providing a hotel. I retrieved a ride and made it to my destination (13 hours later than I was supposed to be there) and proceeded to follow up with phone calls to ask where my baggage might be since the workers at the airport did not answer any of my questions. The people I spoke with on the phone were just as rude and inconsiderate as the other United Airlines workers I had previously spoke with. I will not be flying with them again. (I also did not get my money back and I purchesed traveler’s insurance).,-1
2018-06-12,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Boston to San Francisco,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,An incredibly disappointing experience,True," An incredibly disappointing experience on United. Traveling to the Bay Area for a conference, I booked this flight on a 777-200, thinking it might be kind of fun to fly on a domestic widebody and that the cramped 3-4-3 configuration would be fine. How wrong I was. There was a half-hour delay prior to departure — annoying, but not a big deal. Once on board, however, I noticed that the TVs had been removed and replaced with personal device entertainment holders. However, we were informed that the Wi-Fi did not work and, as such, we wouldn't be able to use the Personal Device Entertainment. A six hour flight with no TVs or Wi-Fi. Unbelievable. Throughout my whole experience, the crew was incredibly rude and inattentive. Upon landing at SFO, we waited on the taxiway for 50+ minutes since (as the captain told it) United operations had screwed up and didn't have a gate for us. There were a number of passengers connecting on to other destinations, many of which there is only one flight a day to from SFO. All told, we arrived at the gate around 1.5 hours late. Combined with our delay leaving BOS, many of my fellow passengers missed their connections and had to be put up overnight. My experience on the return flight was slightly better — the Wi-Fi/personal device entertainment worked and the crew was more courteous — but the damage had been done. If I have any choice, I'll never fly with United Airlines again.",-1
2018-06-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Newark,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,wasn’t one update at all,False,"  This was my first time flying United and it was a nightmare! After being delayed for several hours we never got an update for the reason as to why. We then ended up missing our connection. Stood in customer service for over an hour. Not that it would have changed anything, but they didn’t even apologize. We then got on our flight and sat on the runway for 2 hours. There wasn’t one update at all! I mean come on. I thought I was being pranked. I asked the workers and they said they would let us know. Never did we hear anything or get an apology. Not even a free cocktail. Heck I would have been happy with some water when waiting for so long. This was terrible and I would never fly United again. I fly 100 times a year and this is by far the worst. Do not make the mistake flying United. I thought it was just bad luck all the negutivity surrounding them but it all makes sense. We then had to have a United employee help us find the new best route possible. We thought the experience was going to get better, wrong! He ended up booking us on to the wrong flight which we didn’t figure out until we were supposed to leave. I could keep going but I think you get the point. Whatever you do never fly United. Even if you have to pay a little bit more it could save your trip.",-1

This is United's biggest challenge and if they don't fix it they will be bankrupt again in the near future. I, for one, and seriously considering leaving them for good.",-1

It is so rude and inconsiderate. Every couple we have met, including my husband and I are all split up. We also were not allowed to sit together because of “the type of ticket we bought.” I’m a paying customer like everyone else! On top of all of this, we have been delayed for two hours because the pilots aren’t here, but the plane has been here an hour. Oh, and they made people check their carry-on luggage and pay the baggage fee. This is the most disgusting experience ever and it will be our last with this company.",-1

My flight from Mexico City to Houston was delayed an hour. I only had 30 minutes to go through customs and get my bag then find my connecting flight in this huge airport. I didn’t even make it through security, missed my flight home. So I got a standby and I know for a fact I was the first person from Mexico City to get a standby ticket to Tulsa! I used my mobile customs app so it took me seconds to get through. The women boarding the plane just picked random names. I’m confused on why the names aren’t in order! They should be first come first on a plane! So I didn’t get on it and was stuck in Houston until the next morning at 8am. But I’m mainly writing this review because everyone that works at United airlines in Houston TX are miserable. Everyone I’ve talked to has had an attitude and I don’t understand why. It’s your job - I’m just asking a question because I have no idea what to do! I’m by myself in a city I don’t know and a massive confusing airport, that likes to change gates regularly.",-1
2018-06-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Las Vegas to Houston,1.0,,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,been my worst experience,True,"  Las Vegas to Houston. Worst experience flying in 20 years. Flight delayed 4 hours and counting, notification was not sent until after the 2hr required time to be at the airport. Gate personell nicely told us it was an ""Act of God"" and was not the least bit interested in making our time at the airport pleasant. The poor man behind the counter asked for help and with a line of 2 carrier and his supervisor said, ""Just excuse yourself, they can wait."" We asked for a pass to the lounge to pass the next 4 hours and they wanted to charge us 69.00 like we were walking in off the street. The inflight entertainment was not accessible and our tablets are brand new and we had to pay an extra 100 just to be able to sit in our seat without the person next to you sitting in your lap plus we paid 50 to check one bag a piece. I have always flown United but this may be our last trip for the price of our flight I have much better expectations. I have flown internationally and all over the US on many carriers and this has by far been my worst experience and this is the 2nd time this has happened to me at this airport. I am very disappointed.",-1

My experience flying from Chicago to Detroit reminded me why. The flight stays option does not label information which causes confusion when reading. This can be frustrating when making travel plans. The flight attendant was the main issue. As a representative of the company, I would think you would want your attendants to be clean looking. Not as if they were hungover from partying the night before. Hair a tangled mess and makeup smeared. Her attitude towards customers was welll below par, making faces after one gentlemen ordered extra and snarky with her responses. Needless to say I will not be returning.",-1

I paid for him to have an escort & the airline did not provide an escort & left him alone the entire time. My son called me very upset that he couldn’t find the terminal or gate. Every United employee he asked for help ignored him. If it wasn’t for TSA. He would have missed his flight. It’s about time we stand up against the airlines for stealing our money & putting our children at risk!,-1

I was promised hotel compensation because my flight was delayed two hours which caused me to miss my connecting flight (no flights going out until the next day). Customer service first of all, was rude from the start (I was trying to be so patient). Then I was told “it’s the governments fault your plane was behind so we can’t offer a hotel voucher, just a discount.” I am now sitting in the airport overnight waiting. No meal voucher. Nothing. Thanks United. I paid hard earned money for this terrible experience. Warning: book an early flight so you can get home the same day you start traveling.",-1

We boarded the airline and within a few minutes it was announced that the hydraulic system lights malfunctioned, we waited inside the plane for 2 hours. Then they asked us to get off the plane, and at a different terminal we took another United plane. We were originally scheduled to arrive at EWR at 11 pm and we arrived at 2 am. Reached home at 4 am these people are so clueless that they did not offer anything like snacks or lunch boxes as complimentary but instead we had to pay. Bad airline, bad service.",-1

I've been flying with united for quite a while and now I have had enough. Had family problems come up and had a round trip planned and it costs $200 just to change the date and more money for the flight price difference. If it was cheaper I would be more understandable but when you have to pay almost $400 to get home 2 days earlier it's kind of ridiculous and I will never fly United again.",-1

Myself and 500 other United customers waited in the customer service line and Denver Colorado after missing our connections. Choose between going to Eugene at 7pm the following day or I'm returning to Oregon by 9am, but Portland instead of Eugene.

We were delayed by United. Upon finally arriving to our connecting flight we were forced to be late waiting for a gate to disembark. Once finally in the terminal, they would not let us board our connection even though the workers said they say they saw our plane arrive and knew we and others were on it. Needless to say, the connecting plane was still connected to the terminal. Had to wait an additional 3 hours for a flight. Will never fly with United again. Also most uncomfortable seats ever.",-1
2018-06-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buffalo to Savannah via Washington,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,Disgusting customer service,False,"  Worst customer service I have ever received from start to finish. Before even getting to the airport I called to speak to a rep in regards to my first flight being delayed and was cutting it close to the end of boarding of the connecting flight (15 minutes). I was told by the rep that they had no way of contacting the airport to let them know that there were passengers delayed from their first flight but would be arriving just as boarding closed. I asked to speak to someone else and the rep said ""I can't transfer you, but you can call back and wait through it all again"", not impressed. Then at the Buffalo airport we were reassured that we would make our second flight as long as this first one left on the scheduled time still, and if not we would be given a hotel room for the night, refunded for our hotel missed and sent out at 8:40 am the next day. Well what do you know, we missed our connecting flight by 5 minutes as they closed the gates, the ""hotel"" we were told we would be given was actually all booked as their was a rally in town and we were told we could ""sleep on the safe airport floor"" by the Supervisor at Washington-Dulles. Also, the 8:40 am flight we were told we would be on was actually 12:00 pm. Now for the ""reimbursement"" we were told we would get, that was a joke. We were told we would be reimbursed for our hotel that we had to stay in (IN VIRGINIA), the hotel we missed, our cab rides etc -  we were not. We were offered flight vouchers (I will never fly with them again) and then offered to be reimbursed for one night, and the cabs. Disgusting customer service. Everyone told us something different, and in the end we were out over $250 in the hotel room we missed, data overages to find accommodations and food. Book with anyone else, it is not worth the cheap ticket price.",-1

Time to board and everyone got up and assembled a line. Then, flight was delayed an hour, then it wasn’t. Then it was time to hurry up and board. The line was a disaster. No one could tell where the line was. Or, exactly what was going on. Were we boarding or were we delayed? The app wasn’t updated. People were worried about getting their carry-on bags on because they kept announcing that it was a full flight and they were worried about space. So people were trying to get on plane as fast as they could to secure space. People were cutting in line and being super aggressive. The people in charge could have cared less. They were oblivious to what was going on, but seemed hurried. We finally get on plane, many had to check bags which was time consuming. Now we sit on runway. I have never seen a group of flight attendants so checked out.",-1

It is always a problem when flying. I have vomited on the airplane in the past. The only thing that helps is sitting near the front of the plane. I booked my flight accordingly as was able to choose appropriate seats. However, my seat was changed and all United personnel refused to help me find a seat to accommodate me. Then when I arrived at my assigned seat 17D, I discovered the seat did not recline. Therefor I cannot wear my neck support either. I will never fly united again. They should be ashamed of their disregard for customer safety and comfort, as well as their terrible customer service.",-1

2018-06-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Santa Barbara via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,sheer lack of communication,True," Newark to Santa Barbara via San Francisco. Worst. Experience. Ever. From start to - and not even at our final destination yet. I’d give them zero stars if I could. Flight from Buffalo to Newark was delayed for 2 hours (understandable as I’ve traveled extensively in the past.) While waiting, the company tag line used on the plan to the passengers was as follows: “seems like its an electrical maintenance issue on Newark’s part. Sorry everyone.” Still relatively understandable. This made us miss our 2 other connecting flights moving forward. When trying to reroute our flights once we finally got to Newark, we asked the customer service rep for the airline to put us up in a hotel in San Francisco because we’d be stuck at the airport until 8:45 am (after landing around midnight as it was the earliest flight to Santa Barbara/home.) “No. It was because of weather. We don’t do that if it’s because of weather,” the customer service rep advised. At no point was the weather cited as any part of the cause for the delay! Whatever. Horrible attitudes with the employees at the gate as well. Finally we were able to get on to our re-routed flight (which, by the way, was also delayed for almost 2 hours as well.) I have a roller bag that easily fits in the overhead compartment. Before the plane was even 1/2 full, they started pulling luggage to check in. At the gate, I explained explicitly said that if I check my bag, I need to grab it from the gate itself and not have them send it directly to our final destination (Santa Barbara) or the general checked-in luggage. There was plenty of overhead space by my seat, mind you. Nope! We had to leave the gated area to the baggage carousels, where the flight attendant told us to go, and nothing. No bag. Apparently they were “holding it” to get it on our last flight which leaves in 7 hours! I have things in there I need! And now the security checkpoint is closed so we can’t even get back into a nice quiet area to find a place to sleep for even a little bit because of the sheer lack of communication, horrible customer service, and complete lack of empathy. I will never again fly with United and I hope nobody else will either.",-1

Worst customer service ever and made me and my sons experience horrible. I missed my boarding time by 5mins even though my friend was on the phone with me while I was running to the gate because they told her to call me and tell me to hurry. So she got on the plane since they told her to and once she was on they told her they canceled me and my sons flight. The ramp was still connected to the plane when I was trying to get on and my friend said they hadn't even shut the plane door yet and on top of that when I looked at the flight after they took off the flight status was “early departure”. There was no reason to not let me on the plane and and the lady I was speaking to was rude and also the lady my friend spoke to on the plane was rude! My friend said the flight attendant had just shrugged her shoulders with a smirk on her face and said well we already canceled her and her sons flight. I had to sit in the Miami airport for 8hours with my 8year old son and they were just rude about the whole situation. Worst experience I’ve ever had.,-1

United has the worst customer service. I was afraid I was going to miss my connecting flight so I informed a crew member. All they had to say was: “we cannot help it”.

2018-05-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tokyo Haneda,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Never again,False,"  San Francisco to Tokyo Haneda. I've had mixed feelings about this airline. I was careless enough that the ANA ticket that I purchased was actually operated by United Airlines. The horrifying experience with them starts from customer service. I telephoned them obtaining inquiries on how a less than 24 hour transit would handle baggage. I was informed that the baggage will transfer directly to my connecting flight (which was finally, and thank heavens, ANA from Haneda to Manila). The reservation agent said that connecting within 24 hour transit will not result the baggage to be claimed in HND and will be directly handled in MNL. Fine. We checked in Day of our flight with our luggage weighing less than 50 lbs, 5 luggage due to my star alliance gold status, along with my brother's normal traveler status. We were informed that the luggage will be offloaded in Haneda. This is a conflicting to the information I was provided few hours ago. The check in agent said ""You can just re-check in to your next flght"" I asked her, ""are you sure"", she was proud to answer ""NO"". Why suggest with utmost certainty to do such thing without verifying your sources. I had asked for supervisor and I was replied with ""We do not have a supervisor, he is busy!"" I am at my point of my fumes reaching to the airport's ceiling on the way how I am being handled. Finally, the supervisor at that time came and handled our baggage with manual baggage tags. The check in agent even uttered ""good luck in finding these bags"", while the supervisor gave her a blank stare. These words were also added to our fiasco Agent: There is no way I will write manual airport codes with these baggage tags, they will get lost for sure. (At least she cares about my baggage possibility of being lost). Agent: Your baggage cannot be held at the airport for security purposes. Really, security purposes? I will travel with my luggage for more than 12 hours (note it will go through a strict security check, hence, adding another 12 hours should not make any difference to impose threat to security. I am not sure why United continue to impress us with their undying no customer style of service. It was not United Airlines ticket that I purchased, it was under ANA but unfortunately, the operating flight was United. The check-in agent did not offer us any help that at least by reaching Haneda, a ground staff would assist us with our luggage to connect to another airline. I guess by customer's putting up their weak customer service to even lower than worst, keeps them in the market. Never again.",-1
2018-05-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to South Bend,4.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,never flying United again,True,"  We were flying from STL on United to ORD. The STL departure was 10 minutes behind schedule. When we arrived at ohare at terminal B, our connecting flight started boarding at terminal F. Our ticket including on the United app said gate F16, so we ran like home alone a mile through the airport. When we arrived (F16) they had not started boarding, so My wife left her phone and bag with me to use the bathroom. They had changed the gate to f17 with no notice and told me I needed to board and they’d wait for my wife. She didn’t have her phone or her ticket and I was rudely asked to board and leave my wife. They could have easily just explained let me take your carry on to load and wait for your wife. There would have been no way to communicate to my wife where she needed to go, where her bags went, and where I went. I wasn’t going to strand my wife and leave her behind. Then my wife returned and sprinted to get to the gate where I flagged her down. After getting on board, the gate attendant came back and continued berating me in front of the whole plane about not leaving my wife behind and denying to board until my wife was with me. Terrible service, never flying United again. I hope this gate attendant is made to undergo public relations training and learns how to speak politely to the people to the people who are why she gets paid. Frustrating experience where I was berated by an awfully rude gate attendant for not leaving my wife in a different city because United’s flights weren’t on time and they changed gates without any notification. Here’s to never flying with United again.",-1
2018-05-29,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Paducah to Chicago,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,does not care about their customers,True, Two customers and I missed connecting flights to Orlando by 10 minutes due to a previously delayed United Airlines flight from Paducah. United does not care about their customers whatsoever. How could they not communicate that they made a mistake and several customers would be arriving less than 10 minutes late to boarding time. Easily the worst airline I have ever flown. Terrible customer service.,-1
2018-05-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Dallas Ft Worth,3.0,,5.0,,1.0,1.0,1,nickel and dimming you,True,"  Newark to Dallas Ft Worth. This airline is a glorified Spirit Airlines, nickel and dimming you for everything. I had a personal item that fit under my seat with no issue that was checked off by an agent on my flight to Newark. On my way back the agent refused to check off this same bag and said it was a carry on and had to pay $25. I could have paid the same amount including seat selection and carry on on another airline for less had I known without the hassle and frustration. The agents were incredibly rude. I  will never fly United if it’s the last thing I do. Terrible experience, customer service, pricing and policies.",-1

They forgot to check levels of nitric oxide prior to our 6am flight from Moline. Then it took them 90 minutes to get a mechanic there to fill up the nitric oxide. We missed our connection, they then were rude trying to place us on a new flight. Then they sent us to Newark instead of La Guardia. Slow, lazy, and rude United employees cost us a day of our vacation without ever an apology. Will not fly again because they don’t care if you get to your destination on time.",-1

I bought my 6 of Economy plus seat at the same time I purchased the tickets. After that when I go to the UA app to intend to change my seat to regular Economy instead. There is no warning appears to show that if you change to lower level you won't get a refund. Only on the website does not on the APP. Lucky that I just try of 1 seat, not all 6 seats. So, I lost 1 seat of Economy plus which is under my name. All 5 others seat still stay the same and never change. I was annoyed but I got my fault I went back and rebuy my former seat with extra $69. After that, 3 days later again I got extra other 6 times charge of buying Economy plus seat which mean they are total charged me 12 times. It messed up my bank account. I am really disappointed and upset about it.",-1

This is the second time my international flight gets messed up because of aircraft maintenance. I arrived to Washington D.C on time to take my connection flight to London, they boarded the plane and then after 30 minutes  informed us that there were a problem with the software of the plane and they will be working on it! I understand that this can happen but it’s been occurring a lot to United airplanes! And then the attendant gave me an attitude cause I was checking about the possibility to do something about my other connection flight from London to Beirut cause obviously I will be missing it for sure having the first connection delayed. I was hoping that reviews on United Airlines were wrong but unfortunately it seems most of them are true and the airline needs a lot of improvement specifically to the aircraft, and mostly to the customer service.",-1
2018-05-25,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to San Francisco,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,terrible experience,False,  Detroit to San Francisco. Terrible experience! Flight delayed 2.5 hours because of “fog” but other airlines were still flying to the destination. I specifically packed light to use a carry on and ended up having to check my bag because the overhead space was full. Only half of the passengers were boarded at the time of my arrival and I witnessed passengers getting on the plane after me that were able to find space in the overhead bins. Expressed my concern of checking my bag with the flight attendant and she said “I’m on the verge of tears too. I just can’t right now.”,-1
2018-05-25,0.4,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Miami,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4,learn how to treat your customers,True," I would like to start off by saying I have never been treated so rudely by any other airline staff. I was supposed to fly from Newark to Miami on May 15. Due to some of the weather we were experiencing united sent out an email stating that I was able to change my flight to an earlier flight or later flight because my flight would more than likely be delayed and or canceled. In this email it also stated that I was able to change my seat for free as long as it was in the same class cabin (economy-economy plus). I then called United to have my flight changed which would in turn change my seat. I was flying economy but the only available seats were for economy plus however that did not matter because United said that they would waive any change fees and any seat change fees. When I called to try and have my flight changed I was spoke into extremely nasty, I was told I didn’t know what I was talking about, and I was told ""that’s just how it is"", when I try to explain that United had already waived the change fee for the seat and customer service was still trying to charge me $150. I was determined to get on this flight as my scheduled flight was already delayed five hours. The flight I was trying to get on was delayed an hour. I did not give up as I went to the airport went through TSA and got to my gate. I had to physically show the email to her United worker to get them to believe me. I do not understand how the company is not in sync with their employees. How are you sending out mass emails that your own employees don’t know about it makes no sense at all. I was hung up on three times and treated very poorly. We used to like flying with United but lately something is gone bad. Take note from Southwest and learn how to treat your customers.",-1
2018-05-25,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Boston via Washington,5.0,3.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,I will fly them again,True,"  I traveled from Houston to Boston via Washington, DC on United Airlines in basic economy. It started off badly because you need help checking in at a kiosk if you are in basic economy and not checking a bag. A representative has to check if your item can got under the seat. I had one item that would go under the seat and a plastic bag full of paper work I was sorting. The United airlines attendant said could I get the small plastic bag into the other bag and I responded that I was sorting and it would be empty by the time I got to the gate. She said I am sorry but I cannot let you check in unless you put the contents of the plastic bag in the under the seat bag. I stayed at the kiosk and started the sorting through my papers. A supervisor came up and approved me saying I was only allowed one personal item, which I knew. I then went over to a seat and sorted my papers, then went through security with only one personal item. The flights were good otherwise with free soft drinks and coffee. I will fly them again in the future.",1
2018-05-24,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolutely horrible experience,True,"  
Houston to San Francisco. I had an absolutely horrible experience with United (as I almost always do), but this time will never use them again. I payed a lot of extra money for a late flight one evening (8 pm), and then they kept delaying it due to “weather” in San Francisco, even though every other airline’s flights had no delays or cancellations to SF. They eventually cancelled my flight due to said weather at 10:45 pm (another United flight to SF at 11 pm that night took off without delays so I know it wasn’t weather). Then I had to get in line for an agent to rebook, which was >100 people long. In the hour I waited, I called United and was placed on a “5-10 minute hold” that was actually >30 minutes, only to tel me there’s nothing they can do. When I got to the agent finally, around midnight, he rebooked me for an AM flight and gave me a 35% discount to nearby hotels but no free stay since the cancellation was “out of their control.” He promised me that if I payed for the hotel however, that United would reimburse me no questions asked. I confirmed this several times and he literally promised me this is the case. I payed $100 for the nearest hotel and spent the night. I filed the complaint to get my money back and they replied 5 days later with a short email saying they will not reimburse me anything but hope I can overloo this and continue to use their airline... I called United to clarify and they said customers are unable to speak to customer service on the phone, only email. This has been an infuriating process and I will certainly never use United again.",-1
2018-05-23,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Albuquerque to Raleigh Durham via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,train your employees better,True,"  Albuquerque to Raleigh Durham via Denver. This has got to be the worst experience with an airline. Never in my life have a missed a flight and due to unforeseen circumstances we were running a bit behind. When checking in our bags there was a further delay due to some baglogs with the luggage’s. Since we were running behind, we asked how we were doing on time for boarding and the lady looked at our bags and said we had plenty of time. Then the TSA line was running very slow and were not able to do anything for us to expedite the process. We run to our gate and we find the gate closed but the desk attendant was opening the door for a passenger, but then as she is closing the door while the plane is still there, she just says YOU’VE MISSED YOUR FLIGHT. - again, she had just opened the door for a man right in front of us. The plane was Still there for another 7-10 minutes before it got disconnected from the bridge! Now there is no other flight to get us home until midnight, minded that we pleaded with her and told her that we have another flight to catch in the morning to Chicago. I understand the policy of getting to the airport with plenty of time to spare, unfortunately our morning was filled with issues that held us back. I don’t know what was going on with her day but that sure is not a way to show customer service. She was also rude and not cared one bit about our situation. I hope that as a corporation you are also training you employees about customer service, care, and a bit more of humanity. Neither her nr her manager at the ABQ airport showed neither of the characteristics of a position that requires customer service characteristics. I will never fly this  airline again and I will make sure to share my disappointing experience with others. I hope you can use this to train your employees better.",-1

All day of traveling. Flights delayed. Board a plane from Fort Lauderdale to Key West and have to get off cause something is wrong with engine. Miss my direct flight to Key West cause I was given the wrong directions from a worker. Had to pay $50 to check a carry on.

This will definitely be my last time to fly American. We were wanting to eliminate a long layover and had already sought out another flight to transfer too. We were then bounced around between customer service employees who would tell us they couldn’t help us but the next person would be able to. After meeting with three different employees, we finally had someone tell us our tickets were not applicable for flight transfers but gave us no rationale why. The customer service is poor, unprofessional, and lacks quality. I will never use this airline again.",-1
2018-05-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Medford via San Francisco,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,never been treated so poorly,False,"  Raleigh Durham to Medford via San Francisco. This flight was delayed 5+hours meaning our connection in SFO would be missed. United refused to offer a food voucher, refused any hotel accommodations in SF and refused any compensation for the flight delay. Called United and talked to supervisor Chris after an 1.25 hour hold. He just said, “can’t help you, write a review”. That’s it. I have never had a supervisor be so rude. This is the second time I have had an issue with terrible customer service with United in the last 8 months. The last time they would not let me cancel a ticket when I had bought trip insurance. I have never been treated so poorly. Very sad that this airline has zero customer service, and has gone from one of the best airlines to one of the worst. Hopefully they will care about these reviews and try to improve. We will see.",-1

My sister's flight had to be rerouted to Billings so she would make work. She will have to find a ride the day after back to Bozeman to get her vehicle. My daughter's flight was jacked kind of both ways coming out of Washington was fixed so she could make it to Kauai, her flight home which was a different flight, ended up with an 8 hour layover in San Francisco after an all night flight, I ended up with a 12 hour layover in Denver. After talking to my son, his last flight with United left him stranded in Seattle and he had to rent a car to get back home to Tri cities. No apologies, no refunds, this is not acceptable. Will stick to Alaska and Delta in the future.",-1

The food served was very acceptable and drinks were available when required. The Polaris flight was certainly an upgrade to the flight that we had from the UK to San Francisco! As a personal thing i would have preferred to have had a window seat as I did feel a little hemmed in in the aisle seat. Just one thing spoiled a short part of my journey. The rising wall between the two middle seats, of which I was travelling on one malfunctioned and sadly it came down and wouldn't return to the up position. This resulted in me being in very close proximity to the stranger in the seat next to me. Several of the stewardesses tried to rectify the situation sadly the wall remained in the down position for a couple of hours. It did however strangely rectify itself after a couple of hours which made me more comfortable.",1

Unfortunately it’s my company preferred airline. Old planes, uncomfortable,no technology, made me check my carryon and when we landed, discovered 4 empty bins in back! I do carryon only to avoid waiting 45 minutes for my luggage. Now I’m waiting for my flight back and the same, asking people to check their carryons!

Our flight from Orlando to chicago was delayed by about an hour and a half due to weather, which in return caused us to miss the connecting flight from chicago to nashville, which was fine, however the man we spoke to first and worked the gate next to the customer service area was rude told me I could not talk to a supervisor then told me he would call one, so he picked up the phone said nothing hung up and said one would be right there, never saw a supervisor, then as his shift was ending and i was still standing there he said 'did one come?' I said no he said ok have a nice drive home laughed and left. The customer service people weren't really wanting to help my family get home finally gave in and put us on a different airline. This is the worst airline to go through, if you can spend a little extra go through someone else unless you are into getting stranded.",-1

The staff was rude and gave us little information about our flight delay. Our flight was delayed for 4 hours! First, they claimed it was maintenance issues, in which case they would have to pay us for the delay. Then, they claimed it was suddenly the weather. What? Trust me when I say the weather was not bad and would’ve cleared up completely by the time we got to Chicago. The staff did little to try to inform us about what was going on. Trust me, it doesn’t make a difference if you fly with a legacy carrier or not! They suck just as bad as Spirit!",-1

Traveled with Frontier Airlines this weekend and it was delayed 7 hours and wasn’t sure if the flight was even going to leave the airport. Had to Book last minute within the airport with United Airlines so I could get home, since Frontier didn’t have another flight until the following weekend. Had 2 checked bags and a carry on. United doesn’t allow carry on bags. I had to check all three for 210$ because I was already inside the airport and didn’t have anything else and had no choice. Baggage fees are ridiculous and both airlines were not helpful in this situation.",-1

I was originally routed through Chicago but when I found out my flight was waiting an aircraft I asked the customer desk to look into the matter. They changed my flight giving me a direct flight to Houston. The flight was uneventful and arrived 20 minutes before scheduled arrival time. I originally had three seats but the steward told me to vacant the third seat for a man who I suspect was a United employee. Overall a good flight.,1

On our way to Las Vegas our flight was delayed 3 hours which made it impossible to get our flight mid way, so we had to get a flight 6 hours after which means we ended up being in an airport for 12+ hours. Not only this but we didn’t even receive a notification that it was delayed so we couldn’t even go back home or do anything but just sit. Then they refused to let us sit together, on any of our flights, luckily there was one person who offered to switch seats. They acted like because we paid for the cheaper seats that’s how we were gonna be treated. We couldn’t even take a carry on with our flight it was just ridiculous. We flew Delta a little less than a year before this and paid for the same type of ticket and when we asked if we could sit next to each other they said no problem at all and allowed us to have a carry on. United also overbooked our flight by 5 people, I don’t understand how do you overbook? Plus when we got our flight we had to PAY to watch anything on their little TVs, where in Delta it’s paid for. I don’t get any of this. Just doesn’t make sense to me! Just not happy with them at all. We will never again fly United.",-1

Now on my flight from EWR to SEA, there’s a 25 min delay which turns into a 1 hour delay, which turns into a last minute gate change far away (just getting out of physical therapy mind you) which turns into another gate change back to original gate after I had made my way over to the new one and everyone is now still waiting in line with the aircraft yet to be seen. What are you guys doing? This is 2018 - learn about customer service - would’ve thought you should have learnt from all your mistakes in this area by now with all the lawsuits and bad press.

Did somebody shrink the size of the international carry on size? Or is it just United Airlines? Wouldn't let us bring our carry on as it didn't fit in their sample carry on box. It fit in Southwest's just fine. Non-existent customer service. We were not rude, just asked why it was small compared the other airlines. Not even about the 25$.

The plane is old and lacks in a few places: built in screen was tiny and showed movies on a loop. The irony is they ask you to use your own device but don't provide any power. I could not get the app to work, I didn't try to find a flight attendant because I had a book. Seat was 25K in the extra legroom and they made it clear you could not just move into this section. I'd rather fly a 2-3-2 layout 767 than a 3-3-3 787. It's such as shame that the modern aircraft are so horrendously tight so you have a choice of space but old IFE/no power or IFE/power but really narrow seats. The legroom was not spectacular given the $140 cost. Food was poor. Chicken or pasta. I had the chicken and the liquid tasted like stewed tea. Didn't finish it and could see others left it. Snack before landing was much nicer. This was a very expensive ticket due to my particular needs for a specific day / route for work so I understand but it is still galling to know I surely paid more than a few of the business class passengers to sit back here.",-1

The flight crew was great. The only problem I had was at security at DFW. The United ticket agent cleared my under seat carry on. The power trip lady made get out of line and go back to the agent that cleared me when my under the seat carry on fitted on the check your baggage size. This cost me another 20 minutes in going back through a line that I had been in just for someone to say ok. This would be the only reason I would not fly United anymore.

The desk was empty and united employees at the gates just stared at us and didn't even call over anyone to help any of us when we asked them. Once we finally found someone they were no help at all, just telling us to try to get to Newark and have customer service there rebook us. If we cant find anyone at 7 pm in a customer service kiosk in Cleveland, how are we supposed to find customer service reps at 1 am when we get to newark, 7 hours after we were supposed to originally get there.",-1

2018-05-11,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,disrespectful staff,True,"  Newark to Orlando. Extremely disrespectful staff by the gate (the first time I interact with them personally) wanted to charge me for an extra bag for my crossbody that only carries my phone(cause i have no pockets, and I carry a note 8, big phone to carry and too expensive to lose). Inflight Crew is rude, they throw the snack at you, literally - anything you request on the flight, you will be treated with attitude. I asked for spirit, then saw they had Ginger, I asked to change it, the attendant literally snatched the cup from my hands and looked at me like I was begging for money. The worst disrespectful, rude, disgusting service.",-1
2018-05-10,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Saginaw,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,the plane still isn’t here,True,"  Chicago to Saginaw. This was the last leg of an international flight for me. They bumped me off of my scheduled flight before I even arrived, which I understood as it was a bit tight, but I would have made it. Than 15 minutes before we were due to board they delayed the flight, just a little bit, then a little more then a little more. Now it’s over 5 hours later and the plane still isn’t here. The worst part is that it wasn’t until after the 5 hour mark that anyone even told us what was going on. No one around to answer questions. This is a business trip so unfortunately I had no choice in the carrier, but I will be sending an email to our travel guys and ask them to avoid using United in the future.",-1

Told the stewardess that the non-english speaker next to me needed a seat belt extension and I was told not to do her job. Was told to stop using my phone while the plane was still parked and the lady just kept standing looking at me until i turned it off. I am aware I have to turn it off and will of course do so but it was not said very nicely. It is always the same but for some reason they keep having the only international route out of veracruz.",-1

My son is 6’4 tall  and we had paid already extra $17 for just reserving the seats together. Crew insisted we can’t change seats even though 70 percent of aircraft was empty. So most of passengers were squeezed in 3 rows. Last time flying with United. This is free, just being kind to your customers.",-1
2018-05-08,0.2,Business,Business Class,Houston to Frankfurt,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,been in steady decline,True,"  Just when you think United can’t possibly get any worse, they prove you wrong. The staff on the flight from Houston to Frankfurt were surly, unhelpful and generally more concerned with chatting in the galley than taking care of customers in Business Class. Food quality has been in steady decline for years as has the wine choices. No drinks offered before departure even when specifically asked for. compared to the other airlines, United has become a budget airline but with premium prices. Management please take note! Now let’s get to the cabin itself. Foot rest was broken, literally in half. Seat sound system did not function. Time to change my allegiance.",-1

I had the most stressful time trying to rebook a flight I wasn’t going to make. I talked to three agents and my phone dropped the call twice. Finally I was given a phone number to call and the person that answered was amazing, he helped me out in finding a new flight for the best price, even though it wasn’t with United, and refunding me for the flight I had missed. After a stressful morning it was so nice having his help and it makes me want to fly with United more!",1

They made us go to baggage claim for your carry-on. This is nonsense. We wanted to avoid baggage claim so we did carry-on but they made us to do baggagw claim anyway because the cabin is full. This is a bad design and bad customer service. They didn't even bring the bags to us which they took from us involuntarily. Very narrow seats and uncomfortable.,-1

I was in row 35, and they ran out of food by row 30! It was an early flight, so no chance for breakfast, then I connected to another United flight will no time for food between. So, very poor performance. No apology from the staff - not their fault, though. Also a crummy little plane with no room, considering the length of the flight. No screens for movies, and no is to charge my phone. It was on time, so that's the main thing.",-1

But coming back was the worst experience ever. No room for my small carryall on the flightfrom Norfolk to DC do it was sent cargo all the way to LAX. I asked for a fragile tag and was told they would put that tag in my expensive carryall. That was not done. My carryall was scratched.  My seat on the flight to LAX was truly a nightmare of discomfort. The phone charger under the seat. And you had no mobility. No food — just pretzels. You need to pay me for replacing my carryall and the broken things. Very irresponsible. I dislike United attitude.,-1

On American Airlines I can download the app in flight. On United you have to download the app before the flight, no one tell you this until you get to see it at 10,000 feet. I purchased the inflight internet. It is so bad, I still can’t download the app. Thanks for wasting my time. I’m not approving any more United Flights.",-1

2018-05-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Nashville,2.0,,2.0,,,1.0,2,cancellation policy is bizarre,True," Washington to Nashville . Today, I remember why I avoid United Airlines at all costs. Not that I hadn't forgotten their unfriendly behavior in the past before, but you would think that after so much bad press and negative publicity, they would care to be more courteous to their customers and try to accommodate them more (at least more than competing airlines). You would think, but you would be wrong. United acts as if they are a ""preferred"" airline when really, I cringe at the thought of ever having to fly them. The only reason to consider them is cost, but you are giving up severe customer service while on board, while on the phone, or while trying to accommodate any emergencies that may come up. Their cancellation policy is bizarre and it isn't even clear on how you can cancel a flight on their website (it's not under their refunds/cancellations tab).",-1
2018-05-02,0.4,Business,Premium Economy,Houston to Detroit,4.0,,1.0,,,4.0,4,the rudest flight attendant,True,"  Houston to Detroit. I encountered the rudest and most unprofessional flight attendant. About 20 minutes after take off I had to use the restroom. I'm sitting towards the front of the plane in economy just next to the lavatory. It's lock and I haven't seen anyone go in or out. I look around the plane people are moving about and using the rest room in the rear of the plane. I proceed to head to the back of the plane to use the facilities when the flight attendant tells me to return to my seat. I explain my urgency and she proceeds to call me out over the intercom. I used the lavatory and proceeded back to my seat. She is now standing in the isle with the drink cart at my seat. With a disgusted tone she looks at the other attendant and says ""Let me guess he's sitting right here"" They both look at me like I have an arm growing out the side of my head and proceeds to tell me that there is a restroom right here, like I'm incapable of figuring that out on my own. I explain that it is locked! She flips the lavatory sign up and unlocked the door. What has happened to customer service these days?  I guess you get what you pay for.",1
2018-05-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to St. Louis,2.0,,4.0,,,2.0,2,"Overall, horrible experience",True,"  Houston to St. Louis. Was 25 mins before board time and was not allowed to get my boarding pass, despite an empty security line and short walk to the gate. Customer service was rude and then thought replacing my ticket with a flight 7 hours later was acceptable. I was trying to see my little sisters college graduation, and I decided to try and catch my first flight and switch tickets back once I got to the gate. However, United had sold my seat in less than 10 mins, which makes me wonder if I actually had the seat in the first place? Overall, horrible experience. I ended up driving to a different airport and catching a flight on Southwest. On my way back to Houston, I wasn't allowed to print my boarding pass because I checked the box marked ""no checked bags."" Customer service lady was rude again and told me I would be charged $25 at the gate if I did not check my bag (which was a backpack). She proceeded to tell me that my ""cheap"" ticket did not come with guaranteed overhead bin space. Went to the gate and had no problem with the staff or using bin space. Didn't make sense why she would tell me that. I've always flown southwest and for some reason ended up with these United flights. They will be my last.",-1
2018-05-01,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to São Paulo via Houston,1.0,,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,unnecessarily rude with passengers,True,"  My family and I were traveling from Denver to São Paulo via Houston, and our international flight was delayed (11 hours) due to mechanical problems. United provided accommodation, but the staff was unnecessarily rude with passengers. We were all tired (we waited for almost 3 hours inside the plane until they decided to delay the flight for the next day), but little information was provided. For the ones who had connecting flights (that would be missed), the staff simply stated that they were off duty. I’ve heard and read about United lack of care with customers, but the way we were treated was lack of human decency. United never again!",-1

I barely made it to my connecting flight. Then I got on my plane to Honolulu which is a 9.5 hour flight. They told us there would not be wifi or entertainment available. 45 minutes later the pilot comes on and says we might need to deplane and there could be an hour delay because of some problems they were having with their entertainment system. I'm frustrated because I am anxiously going to see my husband coming home from a 7 month deployment. I also spent a lot of money on this flight. Worst flying experience ever. Never ever flying with United again.",-1
2018-04-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,will never fly United again,True," Charleston to Newark. I have flown with United for 4 years consistently now and have never had such a horrible experience as today. Customer service was terrible, no help was given, and no solution so I am now flying Delta. I arrived almost an hour and half before my flight - at 5:30am, bags paid for online and check in online done. All I needed to do was put my bags on the flight and get on security line - the line was so long that they pushed the 6:50am flight customers to the front, but when one woman complained about it, they sent us back and said that the flights would stand by for us since so many of us were on those flights. Being sent to the back of the line made me not get to security until 6:25am, with boarding ending at 6:30am. Furious no one could help me or would, and I managed to run to the gate and miss my flight by 5 minutes. I planned according as I have done for every single flight I have ever taken out of Charleston, and missed my flight because of incompetence and the disregard of United and airport employees. When I called to try and book another flight the representative was also extremely unhelpful only offering the most expensive routes or flights for tomorrow when I needed to be home today. When we mentioned I would be taking Delta he started badmouthing Delta and how it would be better to take United - rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful. The horrid stories of this airline disregarding customers needs or even attempting to be helpful have never been more evident than today and I am overjoyed with the care and kindness shown by Delta airlines. There is no doubt in my mind I will never fly United again.",-1
2018-04-29,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Houston to London,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,1,we are done with United!,True,"  Houston to London. United is horrible. We paid $1,100 to upgrade to First Class 8-9 months prior to the flight. Get to the airport and we are NOT upgraded. They say we paid to be in a waitlist.  They say they will refund our money (and 40,000 miles) ASAP. I get my credit card statement and they have only refunded $550! Why? Both our flights were on the same ticket. I’ve complained three times, only to get emailed back by three different people. They have not offered me one little thing for a big inconvenience of not flying first class, much less trying to scam me out of $550. We fly pretty often and we are done with United!",-1
2018-04-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Brussels via Chicago,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,a horrible experience,True,"  Grand Rapids to Brussels via Chicago. Our first plane was grounded for maintenance, and were stuck in GR for 4 hours. We missed a day of vacation, lost our personal pick up, lost a day at the hotel and our first class Euro train tickets. I paid for German airlines and United messed up so bad we had to take United to New Jersey. Our New Jersey flight was taking off late but had to be returned do to an passenger not being able to fly. I had to rebuy my euro train pass for twice what I originally paid and later then my original ticket. When we got to Brussels there was an extra security check just for United. Our seats were not on the ticket, even though I bought the tickets 4 months ago. On the way home from Brussels the scheduled the flight so tight that we had to rush to make the plane. You were not able to buy any food on the plane either. When we got to Chicago, again the transfer flight was so close we barely had time to get through customs with a few minutes to spare running through the terminal. But it was ok because they didn't have a plane to fly. We were another 2 hours late getting home due to no plane and when they got a plane it was held up for maintenance problems again. Most of the time me and my girlfriend didn't even get to sit next to each other. So after paying for a hotel stay we didn't use, extra 100 dollars in taxi fees, airlines I specifically paid for and was not able to use, an extra 300 dollars in euro train fares and lost time visiting my very close friend I had not seen in 6 years. United said the best they could do was give me 60 dollars in food vouchers. It was a horrible experience. I feel so bad for the two employees out of 15 that actually were nice.",-1

Flight was delayed 45 minutes to board and another 45 minutes in the aircraft for take off clearance. I was very anxious because i had a connection after Newark and it was doubtful i could make it. I asked the flight attendant and she couldn’t care less - she told me call your travel agent. Can you believe that. At that time a male flight attendant also on business class told me that if there is a problem United will book me on the next flight and told me not to worry. How hard was what be did? He was probably the only one paying attention to the training. Also the power socket on my seat was off. Again the female attendant turned her head the other way. The male attendant just said give me your cell phone i will have it charged for you. Again so simple.,-1
2018-04-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Seattle via San Francisco,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst flight we’ve ever flown,True,"  Miami to Seattle via San Francisco. This was the worst flight we’ve ever flown on and we were a party of 7, 5 children and two adults we had to sit on the plane for three hours before it took off and they didn’t take off - going to San Francisco should have it gone to Denver to refill with fuel and then it flew to San Francisco. Instead of getting there at approximately 10:00 PM we got there at 2am with five kids and the employees on the aircraft were super rude to our teenage kids. United airlines has the worst customer service we’ve ever seen on an airline they are just completely horrible they don’t take care of their passengers, especially people traveling with children. We had to stay in San Francisco overnight and then get all split up with the family because there were seven of us to be able to get flown home my husband left with four children at 9:45 and I could not get a flight with my other son until 4 o’clock the next day. It was completely horrible the process of getting rebooked took over two hours in the night time with nobody waiting in line and we had to have five people help us to get this all sorted out with the manager stepping in.",-1

On my flight to visit family I didn’t make it to my destination until approx 26 hours from when I boarded the first flight. 3 flights later. We sat on tarmac at LAX for who knows (no one knew) said something with the bathrooms. They need to step up the efficiency made me miss my connecting. Sat on the plane for over an hour when I was almost the last one to board on the way back. This is just becoming commonplace with United I think. Please, people, we have places to be!",-1

Polaris business class seat configuration of 2x2x2 in this Boeing 787-8. Not a typical configuration and a bit out of date set up. The seats are flat bed but all the lower part is not 180 degrees so if you are tall this seat is not comfortable at all – half part of your leg are in a strange angle. Food is not eatable and very basic. Service in minimal. Overall they do the minimum to take you in a 15hr flight. This time with no entertainment system at all -it was broken for all passengers,1
2018-04-18,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Dublin via Newark,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,definitely be flying with them again,True,"  I was a bit nervous about flying United because I've heard so many bad reviews, but we flew from Dublin to Tampa via Washington and then Tampa to Dublin via Newark and on all 4 flights we were met with nothing but courtesy, efficiency, friendliness and helpfulness. There were delays encountered on the Tampa to Newark flight due to weather, but we were kept informed all along the way and were even booked onto a standby connection should we have missed our original connection in Newark. We caught the connection with minutes to spare and fully expected our luggage to miss the flight, but to our surprise and delight it was right there on the carousel when we arrived in Dublin. There was an off-duty Cabin Crew member sitting next to us on the Tampa to Newark flight and she was also helpful and friendly, even though she was off-duty. She got information for us about our connecting flight and showed us where the gate was. I would have no problem in recommending United to anyone, and will definitely be flying with them again.",1
2018-04-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Quebec to Newark,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,staff was incredibly nice,True,"  Quebec to Newark. The staff was incredibly nice, but they had to follow whatever United airlines policy was. I was in Quebec City, where they speak both English and French. My carry on bag was forcefully checked in to be in cargo and it was not handled delicately, I was not told to take my laptop or valuables out, at least not in English, and my screen cracked in the process. I don't blame the staff, I blame a lack of communication and United Airlines wanting to check people's bags in so they don't have to deal with people needing to get their belongings out. Also, who ever handled cargo almost lost my luggage, I had to wait almost 24 hours to find out if they found it because it was a late transfer to the right connecting flight. From the update I got, it was in Chicago when my connecting flight was from Newark to San Jose.",-1

A wonderful captain who kept us detailed through the flight and manuvered thru the turbulence. Me and my family cause a hold up for the other passengers by being the last people on board and the captain waited for us. We had 3 kids and they were more than patient making us feel as though we we're first class when we definitely we're not. The staff was kind and caring and wonderful with kids.,1

My luggage was left in the rain and all of my personal belongings were soaked and beginning to smell after nearly 24 hours of traveling. Once home, I was still able to ring out some of my clothing but multiple books, journals and magazines were ruined, swollen and tearing because they had been wet for hours. I was shocked no one even mentioned this to me or took responsibility for everything in the suitcase getting damaged. Luckily, my laptop and other electronics were with me as carry on baggage or they too would have been ruined. I would not trust United Airlines with my personal belongings in the future.",-1

ZRH to EWR was fine, food OK (nothing special) but plenty of drinks runs and nice snack before landing. EWR to DEN full and late but staff did their best to dispell fears of tight connections. No food offered in Economy, even for a 4+ hrs flight! Soft drinks offered (and nice cabin crew gave a hot pizza, which was appreciated). DEN to RNO full and free entertainment given due to late departure. Overall, UA does not offer a sophisticated product but every member of staff I encountered was smiling, helpful and professional.",-1

My experience with United was superior! They went above and beyond to assist me. I missed my flight because of a traffic issue on the way to the airport. I was rebooked and arrived just 3 hours late, my seats were upgraded. I asked for nothing. After collecting my luggage for a 10 day vacation I went to the auto rental to pick up my car. It was there that I realized I had lost my wallet. A first for me and quite problematic. No license, no money, no credit cards , no atm. No ID at all. The car rental bluntly said, no license,no car! And so abruptly ended my vacation plans because I was to drive nearly 3 hrs to my destination. I was traveling solo. After filing a lost wallet report, I headed back to the United counter to see what I could do. By this time it was 8pm. The agents got very busy on their computers for reasons I did not know. Ultimately, they handed me a voucher for a hotel room, a thermos filled with toiletries , 2 meal vouchers and a return ticket to Phoenix in the morning at 8:30am. While it was a crisis situation for me, their concern and consideration went well beyond anything I expected. I was so very grateful for their assistance and to United Airlines.",1

Initially, my flight was to be a series of connections from Alexandria - Houston - Chicago - Toronto. Weather delays caused the entire chain of my connections to be missed and land me in Toronto too late to catch my next flight with a different airline. So, they rerouted me so that my connections were now Alexandria-Houston-Toronto. United Airlines refused to compensate me in any way shape or form because they claimed that if I have to catch another flight with another airline, that is not their problem. You are an airline, your job is to get me from point A to point B, how you are refusing to do that is beyond me. I was then forced to reschedule the flight I had missed for another day, but of course I arrive back in Toronto and United Airlines had left my luggage at Houston airport. When I retrieved my luggage the following day, a wheel had been broken, forcing me to purchase another suitcase for the flight I had rescheduled. Not happy.",-1

Our United Airlines flight arrived late due to surprise de-icing? We arrived at gate 94 just in time to watch them close the door in front of us. The gate attendant, refused to make any attempt to get us on the plane and quickly rehearsed her ""It's not my problem"" script. We next had the misfortune of meeting the operations manager for United in Denver. He repeated the same ""It's not my problem"" script and then repeatedly refused to even help us to the customer service desk. Complete apathy and lack of ownership. The only small respite was a staff member who reluctantly agreed to help us complete a reimbursement request.",-1

I have to say, I now know what all of the negative public reviews are about. I was yelled at by the boarding guy because he told me my bag was not compliant with flight regulations. I told him that my bag was compliant but that I had my handbag stacked on top which made it look bigger. He held up the line and made me place the bag in the size checker. I took out my shower shoes which I had just placed in the front pocket and he tried to publicly humiliate me as if I were senile if my bag at the gate. My husband told him that I literally just put them in the front pocket because they were in my hand bag and he was so rude and obnoxious to my husband whom never speaks and is a proper gentleman. Due to Inited’s notorious treatment of its customers, I told my husband it was not worth it and let’s just let her get on with it as my bag clearly fit and was compliant with regulations. I guess my point is never ever again will I fly this airline!",-1

2018-04-08,0.8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Washington,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5,service was efficient and friendly,True,"  London to Washington. United's Polaris Business Class service on this flight was efficient and friendly. The 787's business class arrangement is a bit better than that of the 777, but still lags behind the comfort of some of its competitors. Still, the food has been upgraded somewhat, but gone are some of the original Polaris amenities - ie., the second pillow, the bloody mary carts, etc. Slippers must be asked for. Overall it was comfortable with generally good service. Entertainment choices are immense. My main course, ravioli, was a bit too undercooked for my taste. I did not take the second meal, but it looked quite tasty. My only real complaint here would be the state of the toilet which was a mess within a couple hours of takeoff. Obviously no crew member ever looked. But it would be nice if United had someone straighten up the toilet at least once during the flight.",1
2018-04-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Oklahoma City,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3,never fly your airline again,True,"  Seattle to Oklahoma City. Flight was delayed for maintenance at Sea Tac airport. They told us it would be about 17 minutes and we would make all connecting flights. Then it was delayed 30 minutes, then an hour before they finally boarded us. They told me I still might make my connecting flight from Denver to OKC, but if not, they would switch my flight to Tulsa which took off 35 minutes later. She said they'd take care of everything mid-air. They told us on the plane there would be CS reps to help us with our connections. It was one guy who simply asked where you were going and he'd direct you to the gate. I walked 30+ gates away to get to my connecting flight. They didn't have me in the system, and didn't have my luggage transferred. He sent me back to a United customer service desk that turned out to be closed when I got there. He closed the gate, so I couldn't make Tulsa either. So I had to go back 30 gates, stand in line for 2 hours, and be told I wouldn't be able to get to OKC until about 12:30. There were so many people in the customer service line, not just people from our flight. I didn't see this with any other airline as I walked through DIA. Once I finally got through the long line, the lady at the Customer Service desk was friendly and helpful as she could be given the circumstances, but United really blew it and I missed my mother's funeral.  I will never fly your airline again.",-1

This is the most terrible airline in the world. My flight was delayed and then my airline was understaffed causing me to miss my layover flight. There were no more flights to DCA for the rest of the night so they put me on a little plane and flew me to Richmond (three hours from my house) so I could then take a taxi all the way home. In the meantime losing my luggage and getting that three days later. Cherry on top - they refuse to give me a refund.,-1
2018-04-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Richmond,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy,True," Nightmare Experience. Flying from Edmonton to Norfolk. Spent 2 hours on the tarmac in Denver before flying to Newark. Newark was cancelling and delaying flights left and right. United rebooked me onto a flight to Norfolk 30 hours later and I was not going to waste a day in Newark. My fiance said he would drive to Richmond to come get me if I could book a flight there. First time rebooking to Richmond, the United Service Assistant was very rude and didn't seem to care about my situation. Ripped up my luggage tag, as it was on the back of my boarding pass, even though I had asked for it back and rebooked me on a flight to Richmond that left at 6.30. It was 6.20. Had to run down to the shuttle to get from Terminal C to Terminal A in order to get to my gate. Plane was gone by the time I got there. Stood in another customer service line to get onto another flight to Richmond. This service assistant was a lot more helpful and seemed like he cared. So thank you to him. Got me booked onto the next flight out to Richmond that night. Got to Richmond and my luggage was not there. Spoke to a luggage assistant there who was really kind and was able to locate my luggage without the luggage tag. Luggage was in Newark still and I could expect to see it delivered the following morning. I've been here for 2 days now and still do not have my luggage. Everytime I check or call the number all I'm told is that ""staff are still in the process of locating my luggage"". What happened? It feels like after I landed in Newark and the flights to Norfolk were cancelled that my luggage just got tossed aside somewhere and now they can't find it. That or it feels like it's not a priority to them. Maybe I'm being selfish, but I literally only have the clothes on my back and what was in my carry-on with me. I have prescriptions in my luggage that I'm going without. I leave in 3 weeks, so I hope to have my luggage by then. But I'm considering cancelling and rebooking my return trip with someone else because I don't want to have to relive this nightmare again. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.",-1

Boarding went quickly and smoothly and we pushed back from the gate 10 minutes early. The IFE started to glitch out during the safety video, so the crew did a manual demonstration and also let us use the IFE for free (United normally charges for it). The service started a bit late but when it did the crew was friendly and energetic. I felt welcomed and it made my flight that much better. The legroom in Economy+ is excellent, it is almost 10 extra inches than regular economy - well worth the money! The seats were a bit tight in width but other than that, very comfortable. The pilots were interactive, keeping us informed. Overall it was a very good experience with United.",1

I had some trouble with the self check-in and the staff that helped me were plain rude and arrogant. They showed no interest in helping me out and rolled there eyes at my questions. I had never used the machines before and the staff made me feel like the most stupid person on Earth. When my bag were checked in the man behind the counter threw my bag on the belt, no respect at all. The staff on the plane were lovely but that is ruined by the bad impression at check-in.

My fiancée and I booked our vacation back in September, so this should have been a very smooth trip. A couple days before our flight to Denver which was supposed to connect us to Vegas, United Airlines decided to switch our connecting flight and not update us about the change in connecting flights. Our new connecting flight was now leaving out of Washington D.C ten minutes after we were supposed to land. 1) Nobody can get off a plane and sprint down the terminal to board. 2) Our first flight out of Newark was delayed so our connecting flight left before we even landed in D.C. Now we have lost a day of vacation and hotel reservations that we can’t get a refund. We received a response from a United rep saying we could get more leg room on our next connecting flight, which is only 1 hour. I lost a day of vacation and only get maybe an extra foot of leg room on a one hour flight? No thank you. By far the worst experience flying and you can bet that I won’t be flying United Airlines ever again.",-1
2018-04-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Boston via Newark,2.0,,3.0,,,1.0,2,Completely terrible experience,True,"  Norfolk to Boston via Newark. I have never written a review about a service before, but my experience was so bad with United that I felt compelled to. I had a round-trip from Norfolk(VA) to Boston(MA) with a connecting flight through Newark(NY.) Every flight was delayed or canceled -not delayed by a few minutes but hours. Delayed flights caused me to miss my connecting flights and have to rebook another flight. Delayed flights are one thing that I am capable of letting go. However, they didn't even load my bag on a flight home. When i asked about it they simply said ""Oh it was supposed to come on an earlier flight but it got canceled."" Okay so it was just forgotten? It feels like if the bags don't go as originally planned they get tossed somewhere and forgotten until I have to call them multiple times. Still currently waiting for my checked bag to come here on the next flight from Newark to Virginia. I was told it would be coming on flight 4925 - that flight was this morning. It's still in Newark. And I asked if they can be sure if my bag will make it on the next flight this afternoon, but they can't even confirm that. I'll just have to wait until they feel like sending it on the next flight. Who knows when that is. Completely terrible experience that I have never had before.  I suppose you pay for what you get. terrible service.",-1
2018-04-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Redmond to San Diego,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,completely ripping off the customer,True," Redmond to San Diego. I called a United to change a ticket I purchased with my United Airline credit card through the Hopper app. The Hopper app keeps an eye on all the airline prices and compares them for you. It will then alert you when an airline has dropped ticket prices. When I called United to change my ticket to use for another day, I fully expected to pay the usual $125.00 change fee. I was told that since I used the Hopper app, which they consider to be a travel agency, that I was going to be charged $200.00 along with $125.00 change fee. For a total of $325.00. Nice work United Airlines for completely ripping off your customer.",-1
2018-04-02,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City via San Francisco,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,2,felt bullied and belittled,True,"  Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City with a change of planes in San Francisco to SLC (1 hr 32 min.) Airline travel is hard enough without punitive agents. On March 31 we were making a coast-to-coast trip after our cruise. Our return tickets from Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City were with United purchased through Expedia. Our day started at 4 am. Most airlines that I know of allow a carry on and a personal item policy. We chose the United flight because it got us back at a decent hour so we could make the 3.5-hour drive back to our home in Idaho. We had tried to print our boarding passes online with the ship’s computer/printer but were unable to with the directive we would have to see an agent at the airport. We were informed, when were arrived at the airport, that we would have to check our carry on bags because of the nature of the ticket we purchased. We weren't happy about it but did so at the extra cost of $25 a bag. We had purchased a basic economy flight ticket so that did not allow a carry on. We were placed in the very back row 38 and had a bumpy and straight-backed ride for over 6 hours. Fair enough. On arriving at San Francisco for our transfer flight of an hour and a half to SLC we had something to eat and waited. We were the last passengers to board the plane. As we were being checked in the United Agent stopped my wife. He/she said the carry on bag of my wife needed to be checked even though we had just gotten off a United jet of the same size and model so there was no question that it fit under the seat and that is the criteria that was listed by Expedia and United: “Carry-on bags are limited to one personal item that fits under the seat in front of you.” I have to interject here that my wife has used this same personal carry on bag for over 20 years of flying with all the major airlines United, Delta, American, Alaskan, and Frontier. No airline agent of flight attendant had ever given her a problem because of its size or dimensions (9x9x18). It always fit easily under the seat, even with the small computer planes that have much shorter routes with much smaller jets. My wife was forced to give up her personal bag before she could board the flight. My wife sent me on to board since my protests were falling on deaf ears. But after taking about 10 steps I turned around and went back to ask the agent if this had anything to do with the ticket we had purchased through Expedia? She/he said yes. So I went to board. My wife boarded about 3-5 minutes later and when she reached our back seats she was seething. She told me to guess what they had charged her to check her personal bag. I guessed $25? No. $50? No. She was charged $175.00! She told me she had felt bullied and belittled by what took place. This whole experience has soured us both towards flying with United Airlines. We have frequent flyer numbers with the airlines and this incident was completely out of character for the airlines that tout the “Friendly Skies”. It was illogical and unprofessional to treat loyal customers in that way.",-1
2018-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Dublin,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,family unfriendly airline,True,"  Newark to Dublin. Most unfriendly staff ever. We are a family of 3 flying with a 3 year old, the flight is early in the morning, so we had toddler, who was sleep deprived and  we had separate seats with my husband. We asked at the gate to help us to seat together, explaining that it’s easier to handle our son together, but nobody bothered, basically, we were told, that’s our issue. In the plane my son has tantrum with crying, we tried to talk to other passengers, asking if there is a way to switch, no luck. Flight attendants just pass by saying “You are his mom, deal with it”, threatening to stop the plane taking off if I couldn’t have him seated. My explanation that I need at least my husband’s help or the window seat (preferably the second) are ignored. Finally, there is one very nice flight attendant (the only one who seems to care about passengers) who was able to switch us to the window seats, we calmed down our son and he fell asleep. Other flight attendants gave us really bad attitude, as if being a parent means to have a magic wand that will make a 3-year old behave like an adult and quietly sit through the 7-hour flight. In addition, there was no child meal that I ordered, and he refused to eat whatever they offered for adults (the food looked awful), so he had only muffin and a couple of cookies during the entire flight. Most family unfriendly airline, worst flight ever.",-1

I expressed that I had a very short time to make my connecting flight and she just said to leave my baggage outside the plane. You are allowed 1 carry on and 1 personal item.

Purchased two round trip tickets for my wife and I. Both flights were first class. The outbound flight had a wonderful and friendly staff. But I was incredibly disappointed in the food choices. A burger is not an attractive option for a first class meal. Especially one with just cheese as a topping, and no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything. Plus I don’t eat meat, so I was thoroughly disappointed. Worse was the return flight. The seat, tray table and armrest was absolutely filthy. I did not feel comfortable sitting in the seat. It looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in days. Old food crumbs, hair, dust was prevalent. Could not believe United let this happen. I worked my way up in life to enjoy luxury. This ain’t luxury. I’d rather spend my hard earned money with another airline for real first class.",-1

We will never fly United again. Due to a mechanical failure, we were asked to get off our flight from IAD-AMS after an hour on the tarmac. We were then asked to check back at the gate in an hour for a status update, at which point they told us to check back in another two and a half hours, though they were already pulling our bags off the plane. It was obvious the flight was not going to take off, but we were strung along for three hours. When it was finally cancelled, we were asked to walk a half a mile from service desk at D15 to C20. Once there we waited for yet another hour in line. Here is where it got absurd…At the desk the United Service Rep printed out a hotel and 6 meal vouchers for us. While they are printing, our Rep and the other customer service reps were looking at the vouchers and talking about the fact they just said ""invoice"" on them next to payment method and how that was not normal. The manager comes out and tells them that ""it will be fine and just keep printing them."" The Rep hands the vouchers to us and away we go. We wait in line for the shuttle then wait in line for the Westin service desk only to find out the vouchers do not work since there is no credit card associated with them or no established account with the Westin!!! After waiting to get on the phone with one of the United service reps at Dulles, the rep tells us we must go back to the airport to pick up a new voucher with a number! Fortunately Westin knows how to provide Customer service and convinces the United Rep at Dulles to just send over some form via email and puts us up even without a payment method. This negotiation lasted two hours. At this point we have been traveling for 11 hours with only 1 hour in flight. Also none of our food vouchers work at the hotel for the same reason. The next morning we find out the United has not yet sent the form over or paid Westin for our stay. This is the third United flight I have taken in the last 2 months that has either been overbooked or cancel by mechanical failure. United flights are unreliable and their customer service is appalling. All they do is pass the blame and never resolve the issues they have caused. I urge you to not fly them and hopefully one day their awful customer service will put them out of business.",-1

I fly monthly for my business and have experience with multiple airlines - United is the worst! Flew from Detroit to Richmond VA with an 1.5 hour layover in Washington Dulles. Landed in Washington only to be told there was a 5 hour delay on my flight to Richmond. Considering that I needed to get to Richmond early, I asked if there were any other options. Spoke with multiple United employees and their response was to drive the rest of the way. I had no choice, so I decided to rent a car. Then I was told they would not get my luggage off the plane, even considering the plane was going to be there for 5 hours. After speaking to multiple employees, I luckily found one that retrieved my bag. Now on my return, i drive to Richmond airport and then receive a text telling my that my flight from Richmond to Washington Dulles is delayed 3 hours and I would not make my flight back to Detroit. Luckily I had not returned my rental car yet, I park and go in to speak to an agent. Once again, nothing they can do. I have to switch my rental location back to Washington Dulles and drive there as fast as I can to make my flight back home. No options offered, no offer to cover my rental cost, nothing - dont fly United.",-1

I bought three airline tickets in January for our trip in March. On both our flights to NC and returning to MT we were spread out between multiple rows and not able to sit together.

2018-03-31,0.2,Business,Premium Economy,Ontario to San Francisco,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,Never ever United,True,"  I scheduled a round trip from Ontario to San Francisco. I was told my flight was cancelled due to weather condition at the counter when I was trying to check, and they said they sent me a text, which I received during my check in. I asked the lady who works at the Untied Counter, what are the alternative since the flight is cancelled, she told me I can take another flight which is about 2 hours away (Burbank CA), or come back tomorrow, I asked her how do I get to Burbank, she told me ""I don't know, I don't deal with transportation."" Then I asked her ""Am I going to get reimbursement?"" she replied: ""I only check you in, I don't know about reimbursement, you should call United."" I was on a business trip and my schedule was tight, and as I insist on a solution, at the next counter, China Airline's employee felt bad and helped me to found a solution to fly from the same airport going to San Francisco. As I was waiting for my flight, I tried to contact United, I was trying to get an idea of the situation of my reimbursement, and was on queries for 2 hours, until I got on the plane. On the way back, as I got to the counter for check in, United Airline employee told me that my flight was cancelled because they put me on the Burbank flight (without my approval) and since I did not show up on the flight, they cancelled my round trip. They said they tried to contact me and maybe because I was in the sky when they called, but since I didn't call them back, I am liable for this result. At the counter I just wanted to go home and told them I just want to buy a ticket now (I already told my friends when to pick me up, and unlike United, I don't want to change what was schedule.) And the lady was like you can buy it with your phone. I insisted on her booking the ticket for me (I didn’t want to have the risk of, where I brought a ticket online and the counter told me they can't find it) then she tried to book me for about 10 minutes and told me ""I am going to have to stop booking for you since you are about to past the 30 minutes limit to board the flight."" And Later on I found out the person who is ""more"" familiar with the ticketing was on lunch. The most disgusting part is their attitude and the situation they put you in, ""I am not responsible for your schedule."" ""You didn't show up for your flight,"" ""I am not in charge of reimbursement,"" ""you should have booked your ticket online."" Never ever United.",-1

They have always been helpful when we found ourselves in a quandary and over the years I remember only one incident where I was upset about the quality of customer service when dealing with United employees. Today United came through for me again, far above and beyond the call of fair customer service: my FF status expired in Feb as I had a slow travel year in 2017 and I also missed the March 11th deadline for purchasing a reinsted status, however, a very pleasant and helpful customer rep went the extra mile for me and requested an exception since I’ve been a loyal customer for years - and not only did United reinstate my silver status but they did it for free ($680 value as quoted to me in March). United has my loyalty!",1
2018-03-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bozeman to Tampa via Houston,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,by far the worst airline ever,True,"  Bozeman to Tampa via Houston. United Airlines has to be by far the worst airline ever.  They nickel and dime you for everything and then do not provide what you paid for.  Every employee/representative states""there's nothing I could do (for their own mistake and situation they have created).  Paid extra per passenger to be able to pre-select my seats and guarantee that I would sit with my husband for our long flights (I have developed anxiety with flying).  Paid for my checked bags when booking my flights. I check in to my flight the evening before my flight,  since I do not bring a printer on vacation,  I chose electronic boarding passes.  All info was good, name, correct flight and bags. Once at the airport, an agent told me we had re-check in to get out luggage tags.  We insisted that we were already checked-in with luggage paid for.   She made us use the kiosk, and when I checked in, my name was changed to 'Olivia'.  So now my boarding pass does not match my ID, and they were charging us again for bags I already paid for.  At the counter, a call was placed to United by the ticket agent about the name change.  The person at the other end of the phone stated that another agent had been in my record earlier that day.  That agent denied changing my record.  My name was corrected, a new boarding pass issued,  but no seat assigned.  When we got to the gate, they re-assigned me to s seat different than the one I had paid extra to select at booking, and I was no longer sitting with my husband.  We asked to get my seat back that was assigned to me 45 minutes earlier, but they could not because my original seat was given away. Once on the plane, the bitch who got the seat with my husband would not move.  I ended up in the aisle seat in the last row....by the bathrooms in a seat that does not recline. To top it off, instead of offering to help, the flight attendant told me she was going to escort me off the flight for being upset. United airlines charges over the top prices, charge for everything and do not provide service.  Staff is rude, not helpful and are trained to answer ""there is nothing I can do"".  The bottom line is:  I will take your money, not provided what you paid for, be unhelpful and rude to you.  Then, you are held hostage and threatened to be taken off your flight when you let then know you want what you paid for. United -Tampa to Bozeman MT: $1500 for 2.  Extra charge for seat selection and bags. Delta- Tampa to SLC: $700 for 2. Extra charge for seat selection and luggage. American - Tampa to Syracuse: $490  for 2.  No extra charge for seat selection. United Airlines is a rip-off with very poor accountability and customer service.  Will pay more with another airline next time.  Very disappointed and United will not fix this. I feel like I was robbed. They do not care about the paying customer once you have given them your money. We will never fly with them again. Flight attendants are unhappy and rude, do not assist for anything. Ticket agents are incompetent and stressed.",-1
2018-03-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Boise,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,do not expect customer service,True,"  San Francisco to Boise. I was scheduled for a flight with United Airlines on 3/20/2018. However, the flight was cancelled due to weather condition (which is understandable), but be reminded that United Airlines do not offer any compensation for weather-related cancellations. Not even a meal for >24hr delay. I got onto another United flight the following day, and arrived with a damaged luggage. The baggage service at the airport was not willing to do anything about it, but then mentioned that they will send the bag to a 3rd party in Texas for repair, and I will be contacted by the 3rd party. Two days later, I received a call from United to pick-up my bag at the airport and it never went for a repair. Nothing happened. But it is United, do not expect any customer service whatsoever. United has written rules and fine prints to protect themselves from paying compensation to passengers in all situations, so understand that you are handing over your money without any guarantee of basic service or protection in return. Again, avoid United Airlines at all cost -and remember this for many years to come (it was my mistake to forget past incidents with United many years ago and gave them another chance). A few hundred dollars spent on flight ticket may end up costing you over >$1000 in incurred costs during delays, lost time, as well as damages to your property.",-1

I struggled to get to the airport for a 5:30 am flight and they eagerly switched to a more direct flight, “they were doing me a favor”. It meant I had to be at the Mexican airport 3 hours longer and my wait in Newark was going to be 5 hours and I know they were looking to free up seats on the flight I was on originally. I also had an exit isle seat on the flight I was moved from. It would have been all fine if someone just said ""thank you for being flexible and helping us out” but instead they tried to make it sound like they were doing me a favor. Further annoyed by the unfriendly 2 female attendants for the flight. Simply just not friendly.",-1
2018-03-23,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to Colorado Springs via Guam / Honolulu,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,service and seating was horrible,True," Manila to Colorado Springs via Guam / Honolulu. Worst flights I have ever experienced. Flight to Guam, we were seated and asked the flight attendant if he could put my wife's purse in bin above us, he gave me a dirty look and shut the bin. I asked him again and he finally took it acting as if it was an issue for him. The flight from Honolulu to Denver was horrible, the seats are too narrow. When we boarded we were in 17D and 17E. When I went to put my one carry on bag in the bins above my seat they were full, and the flight attendant gave me a dirty look and said to put it in a bin behind me. This meant I had to put it about 7 rows behind me. The result was when we landed, I had to wait for everyone to leave plane before I got to get my carry on. The reason the bin above me was full was the flight attendant allowed the couple to our left to use two bins for their carry on baggage. When I pay for a ticket I expect to be able to stow at least one carry on above me in the bin. My opinion was the flight attendant could not care less. The other problem is the seats are about 17"" wide and have little recline. I think the management at United needs to try flying and sitting in one of these seats for a 7 hour flight and see how they like it. Overall the service and seating was horrible. If you fly to Asia, I would recommend JAL or ANA as they have great seats and service, plus they provide an excellent meal.",-1
2018-03-23,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Eugene to Little Rock,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,ridiculous bunch of slackers,True,"  Horrible again, missed out on a day again. This trip we sat on the tarmac for 35 minutes because they had no where to park the plane. Missed the last flight and had to spend a whole day in Denver till the following night. After all of that expense we return the next day to find out they have no crew for that flight. So here we sit again. June 2017 they bumped our seats and we missed our own wedding. We don’t care anymore about price. We are going to take our business else where from now on. They are a ridiculous bunch of slackers. In one year we have missed our own wedding In Kauai. And now our granddaughters first birthday. Atrocious I say. Shame on you taking people’s hard earned money on promises you cannot keep. United has no accountability for practices that inconvenience nice hard working people with no recourse besides never flying them again.",-1

Roof at bag tag, bag drop, entry to Security and on board. Absolutely terrible. It is after many flights that I waste my time writing a review. First time I have bothered. Just told my wife to research moving from sf Bay Area just to avoid their hub. Regarding entertainment: connectivity almost always minimal and they explain too many people are using it!",-1
2018-03-22,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Panama City to Los Angeles via Houston,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,disappointed with in flight service,True,"  Panama City to Los Angeles via Houston, and quite disappointed with the in flight service. First, it was a 4 hour flight over lunch, and international. However snacks (except for one tiny bag of pretzels) and meals were only available for purchase at high prices. Maybe I’m just conditioned to the high standards of Delta and American and expect to have at least a substantial snack on any flight longer than three hours. Additionally, in flight entertainment was not free, but my monitor was not working anyways. Finally, seat comfort is not great. The head rest pushes ones head forward and makes sitting for 4 hours quite uncomfortable. Overall, I’m not impressed. While the staff was very friendly and helpful which I very much appreciate, i will try to avoid this airline in the future.",-1
2018-03-21,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Washington DC,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,awaiting takeoff ever since,True,"  Philadelphia to Washington DC. Worst flight I’ve ever been a part of in years of traveling. We boarded at 7.30pm in Philadelphia and have been awaiting takeoff ever since. It’s currently 11.00pm. Not sure exactly on the wait but in the process we have refueled as well as de-ice for a second time. They did give us a sip of water. United sucks and everyone I knew flying delta and America tonight made it on time with no issues. I will never fly again. Thanks for the service, could have just planned to stay another night in Philly but no transparency.",-1
2018-03-20,0.8,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Washington Dulles,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4,the internet was the biggest problem,True," Flew from SFO to IAD and tried to book for the economy plus but the only seats available were the middle seats. However the normal economy seats were actually OK. The inflight entertainment were good, however the internet was the biggest problem. I bought internet for the entire flight however due to connectivity issues, I got disconnected. I bought another internet packet for the entire flight and got disconnected for the second time. The flight attendant gave a United Airlines voucher worth 100 dollars (more than twice the value of the internet I bought). The flight attendants were helpful, friendly and humorous - not something I am used to in Asian airlines but I enjoyed it.",1
2018-03-20,0.6,Business,Economy Class,Washington DCA to New York JFK,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,4,the seat pitch is small,True," Flew economy class from DCA to JFK with the small plane which was fully booked. The seats are tight and the seat pitch is small. My 4 wheeler luggage could not fit into the overhead compartment (best to bring a small briefcase or backpack next time) and had to be put in the cargo hold. The process of taking the luggage was pretty unusual (we were not given any tags and had to queue out near the door cluttering the exit). The business class seem more spacious at it has a 1-2 config instead of the 2-2 in economy. The guy next to me was a pretty big size to the point I just didnt bother even putting my arm on the armrest. The service was pretty good in my opinion, polite but not out of the ordinary. Not a lot of airlines serve this route so I would have to recommend United Airlines!",1
2018-03-18,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Boston,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4,terrible end to a great vacation,True,"  Newark to Boston was extremely problematic. I had boarded the plane and was seated when a man said to the nearby flight attendant that someone was sitting in his seat. The attendant said to me, “I need to see your boarding pass”. Confused, I asked why. She said, “You’re in the wrong seat”, in a rude and urgent tone. I explained to her that I would need to look through my emails to find my original boarding pass. She was rushing me, told me she needed to board all other passengers, and that I needed to hurry up even though she just told me to do this. I showed her my pass from the first leg of the flight. This made her even more on edge and provoked since it was not the right pass. I then found the pass for the current flight and showed it to her. She condescendingly asking, “And this is for the flight now?”, as she refused to read the pass for herself. I said yes and continued to point to the seats me and my friend were assigned listed on the pass. Without reading the pass at all she pointed to my seat and said, “You’re in the wrong seat. You need to move, you’re in the wrong seat”. She was unfriendly, unrelenting, and very angry at me. A man sitting at the window spoke up and said that he was actually in the wrong seat and it was his fault. The passenger that originally asked for help from to the flight attendant, was at this point, visibly uncomfortable by how the flight attendant was harassing nearby passengers and said it didn’t matter where he sat he didn’t care anymore. I ultimately was in the right seat the entire time. However, I was the only passenger the attendant interrogated rudely and angrily. She did not apologize and looked extremely annoyed after this all occurred. Scared that I would be kicked off the plane if I spoke up, I left without receiving any apology from her what so ever. I felt nervous, uncomfortable, upset, and victimized. Later in the flight, another attendant walked up to my seat. She yelled at me to put my seat fully up, two times in a row. I was shocked because I had never put my seat down in the first place. I looked up at her and she said this to me again while telling me to press the button to put the seat up. I pressed the button and the seat didn’t move at all because it was always fully straight. I said to her, “It is fully up”. She said extremely shortly, “I am allowed to tell you to put it up. That is my job.” Then proceeded to glare at me. I said “that’s fine”. And she rolled her eyes at me. She did not treat any other passengers on board like this except for me. I felt treated unfairly and felt like I could not speak up or I’d be dragged off the plane. In both instances, I cooperated, did nothing wrong in the first place and was severely harassed by multiple flight attendants on board. This was my first time flying with United Airlines and I would never go back. What a terrible end to a great vacation.",-1
2018-03-18,0.2,Solo Leisure,First Class,Houston to Seattle,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,1,mediocre food quality,True, Houston to Seattle. I paid for First Class and was disappointed in the mediocre food quality and limited selection of beverages. The only red wine available was mediocre-to-bad and came ice cold in a glass; no way of knowing what was being poured. The FA simply said that there was a red and a white. I don't eat meat and the only two meal options were meat so I ended up eating rice. I would have picked the chicken out of the Cobb Salad but they had run out of that by the time they got to me in row 3 (of 6 rows). The small piece of cheesecake was convenience-store quality. I wondered if United had chosen to skimp on food quality and quantity as a cost cutting measure. I honestly thought that paying for a First Class seat would bring great service and relieve me from the unpleasant economy situation of United. It real only brought me up to what a normal economy experience might be.,-1
2018-03-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Dallas DFW via Washington,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I am really upset,True," Punta Cana to Dallas DFW via Washington. I came from Punta Cana, spent an hour at immigration. When I got out of immigration, someone from United was waiting for me asking if I’m going to DFW. I said yes. They checked my bag. Then, they changed the departure gate. I spent 10 minutes in the airport running to get to the new gate. When I finally get to the gate 10 minutes before departure, the flight attendant says that she can’t let me in. I need to check with customer service. I go to customer service, they rebook me for the next day and do not provide me an hotel. When I fly with Delta, they always provide me hotel when it’s their fault and I will spend the night. Also, we left from Punta Cana 15 minutes after departure because we were waiting for some customers. And, when we got to Washington, we waited 5-10 minutes before going to the gate. Thus, I lost in total 20-25 minutes because of the airline and they don’t want to get me hotel saying it’s not their fault I spent a long time at immigration. Meanwhile, I could have make my flight if I did not lose those 20 minutes. Thank you United. I’m not gonna flight with you anymore! I am really upset.",-1
2018-03-17,0.2,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Orlando,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,She was rude and nasty,True," Flew United Airlines from Los Angeles to Orlando. First of all, they were late boarding and the flight left late. No explanation provided. They said active military could board first. My daughter had her military ID out. Everything was fine until another lady approached and said are you all together and she said our bags could not go on. I have flown all over the world with my family and these bags. Never have I been told that I could not take my carry on aboard because of the size. She was rude and nasty and didn’t care what I said. Nice way to treat the military and family United. Will never fly your airline again.",-1
2018-03-17,0.4,Business,Premium Economy,Newark to Amsterdam,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,it was a waste of money,True," So disappointed! I upgraded at the counter to a Premium Economy seat, for the price of USD 115, as I knew I would be landing with jetlag, and needed to reach my next connection out of Amsterdam. Other than the 10 cm extra leg room, it was a waste of money. Not even a free GT. I do not expect to get a gourmet meal onboard any flight, but the food here was not even worth waiting for. The bread was like a sponge, with a BBD far into 2019. Service was ok, but not more than the minimum requirement.",-1
2018-03-16,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United Airlines should be ashamed,True,"  Denver to Atlanta. The worst airline I've ever flown. The employees were extremely rude and unfriendly. At the desk, when they charge you because they don't allow carry on bags, the employees do not want anything to do with you, except take your money for a bag that should be allowed as a carry on anyways.  At the gate, when they assign you a seat, they don't even look at you. I guess it makes sense with an airline that creates class warfare in the main cabin of the plane. They have about three different classes of ticket for the passengers who are all sitting in the same section on the plane. And they treat those who has a Basic Economy ticket like farm animals. If not, worse. You have to pay wifi, pay if you want a tiny bag of food, pay to check a bag that should be carry on, and all while they not caring about you at all. They have older planes, the ones that other airlines retired years ago, so they're excessively cramped, and dirty, and little things on the seats and in the aisles are broken or falling all. They consistently oversell their flights, so you may be asked to give up your seat.  Since their ticket prices aren't even cheaper than most, I'll be much more happy paying in the same price range to fly a different airline which allows a carry on bag, provides free wifi, allows you to pick your seat, and doesn't treat you like pond scum. United Airlines should be ashamed.",-1
2018-03-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Albuquerque,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I will never fly them again,True,  Seattle to Albuquerque. I have not flown United Airlines in years. Decided to give them a chance as I found a cheap ticket. Flight was late taking off for no reason they could give us. We sat on the plane ready for take off an hour before leaving but they assured all of us going to ABQ would make our connecting flight. We landed get to the gate in SFO and they had just shut the door. There was 8 of us who they would not let on. When I called into customer care they would get us there till almost 24 hours later with a flight that would have another connection so who knows if we would have made that. I asked if there was a fight I could get on with another airline that would get me there that night as I needed to be. She looked and said no. I found one on AK Airlines and she said she couldn’t book with them only American. I asked about getting a reimbursement on my ticket with United and she said as long as I didn’t get on the next flight with them. Was on the phone waiting to talk to manager and I got hung up on. I purchase ticket with AK Airlines that can get me there that day. Call back as I’m walking to their gates. He only refunded me half the ticket since I used the other half. Stated I would have to email a complaint to get other part of ticket back. Well after months of emails and calling I have not received the other half back or anything towards that AK Airlines ticket. They say there is nothing they can do. All I was asking for was $35 dollars! Plus when I got to the AK Airlines gate United had put one lady on that flight so they could have done it. Long story short horrible customer service with no results except a $50 off my next flight with them. I will never fly them again so told them I’m not interested in that!,-1
2018-03-14,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Bozeman,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,astonished to be asked to move,True," My trip with United from Chicago to Bozeman has been all around bad. Not only do they charge you for any bag you try to ship, I arrived two hours early to the airport and I was still almost late because of the undermanned and under-enthusiastic staff as I tried to ship my bag. To top it off, I was confronted about my seating on what amounted to be a half-full flight and forced to sit in the back even with empty seats around. Disgraceful. I understand it was not the seat I had bought, but with so few people on the plane, I was astonished to be asked to move.",-1

I was stuck on an 8 hour flight kept just above freezing temperature. Flight crew passed out more blankets but my toes were frozen, men were wearing hats and coats. I shivered for six out of eight hours on the flight and twelve hours after that. Never again. They offered me a glass of ice water mid flight and I suggested a space heater. That's the last time they interacted with me. The United airlines app that lets you watch free shows and movies does not work on Android. When I complained about the cabin being kept so cold they offered me a $100 voucher toward another flight. I told them to keep it.",-1

Thank you to both the staff of the ground and on the aircraft who were very helpful and patient when weather delayed the first leg of our flight. We had constant updates in the airport as the situation was changing. When it was apparent we would not be able to catch the second leg (unfortunately the last United flight of the day to our destination) They found seats for us on a partner airline. Staff was polite and really persisted to find a solution. Flight was uneventful and cabin staff friendly and efficient.,1

Aircraft very clean. Crew were pleasant and nice. I had paid extra for Economy plus for the legroom. The food was actually very good. The only issue is the tiny portions. The seat back padding is minimal. There is room for the seats to be 1 inch wider each side.

2018-03-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,No more United flights for me,True,"  My husband and I flew from Newark to Las Vegas. We purchased the tickets a few months before the flight and I was advised to contact United to inform them of my pet allergies. I called 10 days before the flight and was told that there were no animals booked for either direction. I was then told to call back 24 hours prior to the flight as there were a few available seats and the pet policy requires 48 hour prior notification. I called back and was offered a seat in the pet-free area (for $200 more each direction) which I declined as there were no pets booked and we were in the home stretch, the 48 hour notification deadline. I was told to notify the gate agent on arrival. At the airport my bag was pulled for inspection as they x-rayed my book and did a thorough check on my EpiPen. When we finally arrived I let the agent at the gate know about my allergies and was informed that he didn’t know if there were any animals on the flight. He told me that it was policy to book anyone with allergies on the next available flight if there were pets onboard. I asked if the next flight had any pets booked as my husband tried desperately to pull me away from the counter but, not before I heard the agent reply that he didn’t know. He did know that my husband and I would be seated in separate rows, 15 rows difference to be exact. As we boarded, our carry on was removed and banished to the bowels of the plane. I said farewell to my luggage and husband, got seated, cracked my book, and took a deep breath. That’s when I began giving my seat mate some serious side-eye to see if she was covered in cat hair as I scratched at my hives and waved away pet fur. I took 2 Benadryl and started hitting the bottle, of eye drops that is. Hour fours, two more Benadryl (that’s four if you’re counting) and a full bladder. I stood up to use the restroom and peered over the seat directly in front of me and that’s when I see it. A stressed out, full shed-mode, Pomeranian sitting on his owners lap. He pants as his owner strokes his fur creating the snow globe from hell. Who knew sitting 15 rows away from your husband would come in handy. I passed the baton (bottle of pills and tissues cause he’s allergic to dogs too) and ran to the critter free zone. To be fair, I am an animal lover but, the pet policies have to be addressed. I’m not the only allergy sufferer and you’ll have a hard time convincing me that this particular dog was a seeing eye dog, a seizure dog, a PTSD pooch or anything but the fluffy family pet. I followed the airlines rules and look where it got me, the run around, and a trip to urgent care for a sinus infection. Oh yeah, crazy small seats, no WiFi, piss poor customer service! Taking JetBlue to Aruba this month. No more United flights for me.",-1

The $150 upgrade was only so I could get a window seat. All of the regular economy seats were only offering middle seats. They take up half of the economy cabin with upgrades, so if you buy a late ticket, you have to upgrade to get a decent seat. Flight attendants were rude (both flights), and the food was awful. I normally have such great experiences with international flights, especially with Delta. This was beyond disappointing.",-1

I never really have problems, other than the occasional unexpected flight delay due to weather. I also haven’t flown United in a couple of years. I purchased my economy tickets through Expedia for a little 5 day trip. Prices didn’t vary but about $5 as compared to others. When I went to do online check in 24 hours prior to flight, I learned I had to check my small suitcase, that I have always carried on before. I travel very light. One small carry on and one backpack. I was told I was not allowed the suitcase and had to check it and pay $25 each leg. Ridiculous. I then had to wait in baggage claim, which I never had to do before. I’ve decided I will not be flying United again for this very reason. This change in policy is taking you out of the market as compared to other airlines.

Our transferring flight to come home was pushed forward about 2 hours. Our flight lanes on schedule, as soon as we departed the plane I asked customer service if we were going to miss our flight. They immediately confirmed before going through customs or security. At this point we had already traveled for 21 consecutive hours, this additional delay increased our total travel time from 23 hours to 30 hours. Especially tough when traveling with an infant. I believe United was fully aware that we wouldn’t be able to make our connecting flight but did not notify us because we would have canceled our tickets. On the other hand, if it would have lead to us staying in a hotel for 1-2 nights I believe United would have let us know. Basically they are only out to protest their bottom dollar and have no consideration for the inconvenience they caused. We declined the $50 travel voucher they offered and will not be using United again.",-1

The gate was still open with passengers loading, the ticket agents said to see the gate attendant to myself and the other 2 folks who were also connecting(with a line of people there). After several minutes (and the gate was still open) the agent finally looked up my boarding pass and said they had actually sold my full fare first class ticket to someone else, because they thought our flight would be too late! The agent was very curt and rude, offered no compensation, he put me on the next flight 4+ hours later in a bad coach seat next to a screaming baby with no food service on an evening 5.5 hr flight! That flight by the way also did not take off on-time as we sat on the aircraft for another 50 extra min making it a nearly 7 hr flight time. not the first terrible flight on United either.",-1

Overall cleanliness and condition of plane was disgraceful and we were apparently on a new Boeing 787.

The overall experience has been absolutely horrible. Our flight was suppose to be at 11am but was delayed until 3:30 because of a “technical issue”. Shockingly there was no mechanic at this airport to fix the issue so one had to come from Orlando which took 4hrs. Older people who were waiting for news in wheelchairs were treated with disregard. New people were put on this plane by the airline only to face this grueling experience. Finally, after almost 5hrs of waiting, the flight was cancelled. Completely disgusted with the unprofessionalism and lack of care that took place. Will never fly United again.",-1

This once mediocre airline has slumped even further down in their level of customer care. They have taken away the option to check in online from passengers that don't carry additional luggage.

United forced me to check my suit and charged me $50 for it knowing full well that it fits in very tight spaces. Their baggage policy also almost made me miss my flight since they dont allow online check-in if you say you are not checking any bags. In other words they are going to squeeze you to the point of missing your flight in order to get that extra baggage fee. Well, they just lost my future business. Goodbye and good riddance United. I will even pay extra to avoid United next time.",-1
2018-03-08,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Miami to Newark,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3,the worst customer service,True,  Miami to Newark. I went against my better judgement in booking a round trip flight with them. This airline has by far the worst customer service I have encountered. They lack customer support and assistance when it comes to dealing with flight changes and cancellations over the phone. The representative I spoke with canceled my flight without confirmation and prevented me from flying out to my destination on time. In addition I had to book a flight for double the amount of money out of another airport and United provided no compensation or refund for my inconvenience. I will never fly or recommend this airline again and please all beware of the airline attempting to scam you.,-1

Next time I would select another airline. Meals very small and I was really hungry after landing.",-1

It was supposed to arrive at 9:30pm and when I showed up they told me the flight was delayed 2 hours. No phone call, no email, no notification. They said she would be in Salt Lake at 12:15A and when I got back to the airport for the 2nd time, they told me my puppy wasn't even on the plane! They used the excuse they didn't have enough runners to board the plane fast enough? Get real people. United Airlines petsafe department sucks. I paid a lot of money for this dog and I still don't have it in my possession.  On a side note, United Airlines customer service is even worse. The employees didn't have a care in the world. Heartless, non sympathetic and very rude!",-1
2018-03-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to New Orleans via Houston,1.0,,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,this experience was pretty awful,True," Original flight canceled due to weather. Understanding this creates havoc. App was good at sending message, but contacting a human to see what options were took over an hour on hold. Re booking direct flight was not possible. Our diversion through Houston worked out OK, but staff along the way were extremely rude and the treatment of basic economy class passenger is like they are dirt. I read and tried to follow the luggage rules. I paid $50 for the privledge of checking two bags. My wife and I consolidated into one small carry-on bag. I was among the last group to board, with everyone else carrying much larger bags aboard when a gate agent yelled at me to stop and demand I pay a $50 dollar fee to gate check. When I told her I had paid the fee online for two bags, she ""let me go with a warning"" but told me to leave bag unattended at the gate (which I refused to do) this is against every announcement and safety procedure airports have. I took it with me to the plane, and asked a stewardess if I should check it at the door. She was friendly, and I was allowed to leave luggage where at least an airline baggage handler took it directly and joked he would have it in New Orleans before I got there. The plane was filthy, dirty tissues in the safety card pocket. Trash on the floor, wrappers and cellophane. PA system didn't work. No internet on this flight (broken). The short hop flight from Houston to New Orleans was about as tight as they can make it (I'm 6'2""). I find it hard to believe this passes the safety rules for evacuation speed, these seats are so close. The message from the airline is clear - if you opt for basic economy, we will make your trip so bad. A fellow traveler joked he had more legroom in the toilet and was tempted to hide out sitting in there for the rest of flight. So, I tried to follow all the rules. I am a pretty easy going person, compliant with others. But this experience was pretty awful.",-1
2018-03-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to New York,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1,non-existent customer service,True,"  Houston to New York. Don't have much to say beyond what everyone has basically come to expect of United: minimal amenities, non-existent customer service, and generally quality suitable for a 3rd world country airline. On the flight  they charge extra for everything, just like the low-cost airline that they are, with the exception of 1 drink and ""free entertainment"" if you bring your own device. Of course, they don't provide a port for charging said device, and also don't actually let you watch most of their entertainment unless you install some software, which on a Mac simply doesn't work (it keeps asking for Flash even if you install it), and on a mobile device requires downloading their app, for which you need Wi-Fi, which, who'd have guessed, you have to pay for. As for the very limited selection of movies that don't require said software, they still don't work on a computer, but on a mobile device are just close enough to working that you'll spend the majority of the flight (not remotely an exaggeration) staring at a frozen screen as it presumably buffers for 15-20 minutes at a time. I suppose the only thing setting this United flight apart is that this time we flew with their new ""Basic Economy"" concept, where for more or less the same price, they manage to exceed even their normal standards of how clear they can make their contempt for you as a passenger (to be honest, little difference beyond disallowing even carry-ons, but they do make sure to constantly remind you of it, which is especially egregious considering that's something even the low-cost airlines allow).",-1
2018-03-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Kansas City,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Terrible customer service,True,"  San Francisco to Kansas City. United Airlines was terrible from the moment we stepped foot in the airport. One employee would tell us that our bags would be fine to carry On, while another would tell us that we'd have to check them, just minutes before boarding when it was already too late. We ended up being stuck in San Francisco, CA and needed to just take the second leg of our trip instead of starting with Bakersfield to San Fran, San Fran to Kansas City because we ended up being stuck in San Fram due to a family emergency. We called customer service and explained the situation to which they replied that our entire flight would have to be cancelled due to a ""No show"" since we wouldn't be on the bakersfield to San Fran flight. We explained the situation again and stated that we'd still be paying for the flight but just wouldn't be on it. They eventually said that they got it taken care of and that we could take the San Fran to Kansas City flight and skip Bakersfield so we were under the impression that everything was taken care of. The next day (the day before the flight), we went to check in to our flights and were unable to do so on the United Airlines app on our phones. We called customer service again and were told that our flight was cancelled completely and that we were going to owe $380 each plus what we had already paid for our flights in order to get them reinstated due to ""fare changes"" and we would have to take the Bakersfield to San Fran connection again. We explained again that this was not possible and what we were told the day before about not having to take the bakersfield part of the flight and that we were told everything was taken care of. The customer service representative stated there was nothing they could do and that we'd have to pay the fee and take the connecting flight if we wanted to make it back to KC. When asked to speak with a manager we were placed on hold for almost 30 minutes and then they came back to tell us that it was a mistake on their end and we were able to take San Fran to KC with no additional charges. While on the San Fran flight the flight attendant was extremely rude. There was a line of people trying to board and she attempted to push past me to close one of the overhead compartments. I asked her if she could wait until we sat down and she said, ""I need to close these now! They're full! Back up for a minute"" In a very brisk and rude manner. She was slamming the doors on the compartments and pushing past people. A couple minutes later when she seemed to be over her tirade, another gentleman on the plane asked her if she was having a rough day. She stated, ""I left something expensive on one of the other planes and they wouldn't give it back."" He said, ""I'm sorry to hear that I hope your day gets better."" To which she then continued to go slam more of the overhead compartments and order the passengers around. My entire United Airlines experience has been awful and we will not be using them again. Terrible customer service is an understatement.",-1

Never had so much problem no only with their schedule time which delay on my flight from Detroit to SF also SF to Detroit. They also cannot coordinate with their ground group. When we land in SF from Detroit and Sydney. We were standing at least for 20 minutes to wait for the group service to start. On top of that, they won’t even hold our connected flight for 10 minutes due to their own delay. I almost think I am traveling in some remote country with their 10 people operated airline.

(For the past year I have made them re-book me on a different airline when they booked me on United). United does it again, I booked an aisle seat as I tend to get claustrophobic cramped against a window for any long flights. United changed my seat to a window. As usual their customer service was very poor. I don’t understand why when you book a specific seat 2 weeks in advance that the choose to move a person to a worse seat. I guess I shouldn’t have given them a second chance. Next time I’ll have the company re-book with a quality airline.",-1

Their customer service is an absolute joke. Do not expect them to own any of their mess ups.

There was bad weather in San Francisco which is not their fault but they didn’t put enough fuel in the plane and we had to land in Sacramento then fly to San Francisco. I missed all my connections and was given a new flight the next morning causing me to miss my connection in San Juan - a cost to me. I now have to sit and wait around an hour to get my bag (a carry on that I had to check because the flight was jammed full. I realize some things are out of there hands but they didn’t offer anything to make my experience better, they have no connection to lounge access so can’t even give you that to compensate or priority boarding for the inconvenience. Their best advice was file a claim online, and we all know how that goes. I think my days flying with United are over.",-1

2018-02-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa Sioux Falls,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,United has always let me down,True, United has always let me down whenever I have flown with them. They are usually delayed and had me wait over two hours for a flight before. So when I was going home by them again I accepted that it wasn’t going to be a fun trip. I didn’t know it was going to be this bad. First off my flight started off late and the plane got to the airport 20 minutes later then we should have. They did not tell us why we were late though. Not only was it late but we had to wait longer than necessary to get our carry-on luggage that wouldn’t fit on the actual plane. Due to all of this we missed our connecting flight. When we finally found the right gate (since it was switched on us at least twice) the flight had already boarded and the door closed. The attendant at the desk was rude and condenscending when she told us that it was closed and the plane left. We proceeded to wait in the customer service line for two hours in order to talk to a rep who didn’t know anything and had to ask her supervisor on every little question. She tried to figure out why the flight was late but found no reason or explanation why. She said yes the flight was delayed but since there was no reason for it she could not get us a hotel room or even a discount on one. The next flight to South Dakota wasn’t until ten the next morning which would have been too late for the event we needed to get to. We asked if we could be refunded and found a flight back to Tulsa. After a lengthy phone call they decided that they can only get us on the next flight back to Tulsa which was at 2pm the next day and if we want to be refunded we will have to call a number and jump through some more hoops even though it’s the airlines fault for us missing our connecting. We asked if we could possibly fly back on Sunday. Since we were already in Denver we didn’t want to shoot our entire weekend down the drain. She replied with a no due to policy. So here we are in the Denver airport at 10.30 at night with no luggage food or a room. We are missing a baptism. With how we were treated and hurt I am now going to make every effort to never fly United again. I will also never recommend this airline.,-1
2018-02-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to New York,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,never fly with them again,True,"  Montreal to New York with United, connecting to Avianca and Tam to Sao Paulo / Salvador. My partner and I won't fly again with United Airlines. First of all, they started by ""forgetting"" to reimburse us a pair of tickets (worth more than 3000$), even after we called to make sure we had not been ticketed. When we had tried to purchase our ticket, they were not able to confirm to us our tickets within 24 hours, so their policy was that our tickets would be canceled - we would not be charged. We took extra precautions by calling them to make sure we were not charged, and were reassured that we would not be charged. One month later we find out in our credit card statement that we had actually been charged. This is not a mistake of charging 10$ extra to costumers, it's more than 3000$! Moreover, we had to wait about 2 weeks to get the full reimbursement once we called them. And lot's of talking over the phone. Second, during our trip, we wanted to change the origin and date of one of our flights. However, when calling United Airlines during multiple days and talking to several agents, some would say we could not change the origin of our ticket. No where on the ticket does it say we cannot change the origin. Also, we spoke to about 5 agents who told us all kinds of different rules and policies (often contradictory) - all with the same end: they would not let us change one of our flights. They told us we had to ""stick to our initial route"" and there were not changes possible. The call center staff is  unprofessional, scattered around the world and all saying different policies, rules, etc. We wasted so much time. As mentioned, we will never fly with them again, we feel scammed, they took our money and that's it.",-1

I booked so called ""Basic Economy"" which is a new way that United Airlines uses to trick and trap customers. Of course I ended up paying $50 for two carry-on bags for each of us (one of them is really small and just because it has 4 wheels). If this is the way they treat customers and make money now, they are digging their grave aggressively. Company like this is really badly managed and have no reputation whatsoever.

2018-02-24,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Los Angeles,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,mock a paying customer,True,"  Houston to Los Angeles. Before my first flight departed, I expressed concern to a flight attendant, because there was only 16 minutes from when the flight landed until my next flight started boarding. She stated to me that we would probably be arriving early so there would be enough time for me and they could ask the passengers to remain seated letting me off the plane. Neither these things were true. I get to the gate at LAX three minutes passed when boarding was meant to end. It is isolated and not a single employee nor other passengers are around. I pace around looking for someone but the doors are shut. I rush back to a staffed customer service stand for answers. The woman I had the displeasure of talking to was in ""Customer Service."" Can I have your last name? No. Do you have an employee identification number? I can't give it to you. She calls my gate and discovers the employees were in the jetway. She then continues to bang away on her computer keyboard for several minutes. There was absolutely NO attempt to help me make my flight. She notifies me that the soonest I can leave is not until tomorrow afternoon. I tell that is not going to work for me. She does not care. That was that. What else can you do? Nothing. How else can I get there? You can drive. I openly express my frustration. About how I asked for help from the flight attendant, she does not care. I demand that there must be something else she can do and at this she picks up the phone to call security. She then says to me ""we're done, you are not willing to listen, we're done."" And at this, refuses to help me and sends me away. I come back to her and said that I was going to need a hotel room for the night. She responds with, ""I am not helping you with anything."" You are not going to get me a hotel? She uses this as an opportunity to lecture and chastise me about I should have listened to her and if I wouldn't have left the terminal [to find a human being to help me] then I wouldn't have missed my flight. I have a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder which I am medicated for. This employee caused me to go into a panic attack which I could not breathe and started to black out. I tried explaining to her I have an anxiety disorder to which she responded with, ""yeah I can tell."" It was the most violating and humiliating thing anyone had ever said to me. How dare one of their employees mock a paying customer who expresses that her medical diagnosis is affecting her.",-1

Filed a claim to get my bags return to Denver international airport after having to check my carry-on bag due to overcrowding on the aircraft. Spoke to a woman at United customer service who assured me my bag will be back the following morning at 7 AM. Return to the airport after having to get a hotel that evening.

I bought new baggage to accommodate their “basic economy” requirements to ensure I wouldn’t have to pay their $25 handling fee + checked bag fee ($30 for my flight, it’s different based on aircraft etc). From ATL to Houston, no problems - return from Houston to ATL though, they stopped me at the gate and said I couldn’t take my bag onboard despite the blue they put on my bag at check in approving it for my ticket. I insisted they were wrong and they tried to argue. I was close to losing my temper and they just said “ok ma’am go on,” as if they were just trying to appease me. Never acknowledged that my bag was the right dimension for my ticket. I went out of my way to follow their rules and was treated like I tried to get away with something. I’ll never use them again, and no one in my company will either. The ticket wasn’t even economical.",-1

United Airlines has one of the most asinine and exploitative reservation and ticketing practices of all the airlines. Breaking Economy into a Basic Economy removes half the options for passengers upfront, and further alienates them by requiring an in person Check In process at a kiosks if they have any bags at all. Their app literally will not let you check in online if you are basic economy, without charging you $25.

Tampa to Houston. Staff mistreated us while we were attempting to check in at the front desk. We walked up to the computer to start our check in process and got to the point at which we needed a United official to assist (since we were flying basic economy). It took the 5 ladies behind the desk about 15 minutes to make their way to us. This is remarkable knowing that only about 4 computers were in use and we had our hands raised/waving for 5 minutes. The employees  ignored us until we  waved at one while reaching over the counter. When the lady finally made her way over to us she took us to check the size of our backpacks in the personal item container. It was a tight fit but they could definitely fit. The lady began to explain that if we did not check our bags, they would charge us at the gate a higher fee. We have ridden basic economy on about 6 flights each (a total of 12 flights) and have never had an issue fitting our bags under the seats in front of us. This lady was saying ""they are going to grab you at the gate and make you pay $100.""  She then went on to record our information after approving us. We didn't get charged, obviously, since our bags fit in the personal bag space. United has lost us as customers.",-1

Just very disappointed in this service as this is a customer service world and with all the terrible publicity United has had you would think they would try harder. I hope others don’t get this terrible no star service, but if that’s what United is going for.",-1

I purchased a ticket from Seattle to Syracuse NY with one stop in Chicago to find out when I got to Chicago that the connection flight is delayed by four hours. No apologies at all. They just really don’t care. Last month they cancelled my flight from Syracuse to Seattle going through Chicago causing me a full day delay and added hotel room and rental car cost for one additional day since they did not tell anyone about the cancellation until I got to the airport. Again they don’t care and they refused to reimburse me for the extra night hotel room. I will never ever use this airline again. Avoid them at all costs.,-1

",True," This airline is ridiculous with their basic economy! It’s not even about no more carry-ons - it’s about not being able to switch to a later flight during a family emergency. I was only flying from NYC to Rochester. I needed to change my return flight to a later date. The original ticket is $150 plus $50 in taxes - makes sense for a 45 minute flight. To change the ticket since it’s “non refundable” - and technically I’m not getting a refund just changing my flight - is a $50 conversion fee and then a $200 fee to switch the ticket! So they’re not helping I’m just buying another, more expensive ticket. Ridiculous. Never flying United again!",-1

I was in Basic Economy and understood what that meant. When I tried to use the machine to check in I was unable to do so and referred to an agent. They checked that I only had a personal item and gave me a boarding pass marked as such. We had a tail wind and made up about 40 minutes flying time. Tea and coffee was free on the flight. I also was willing to be offloaded but they did not need the extra seat. A good flight all around and I will be flying United again.,1

So after finally being deplaned because of maintenance problems, I have been re routed to a flight that takes off two hours later, has a four hour layover at my next stop and gets me home after midnight. I've been dropped from first class to economy. And when I asked if there was any sort of compensation for this mess they have created, I was told I can call customer services. I asked to be put on a different airline so I could arrive home sooner as I have to be in the OR at 7 am tomorrow and was told I couldn't. It is unbelievable how you are treated as a paying customer. Why would anyone ever fly?  When asked why they couldn't have figured out these maintenance problems last night we were told that they don't check the plane until shortly before take off.  It's unbelievable!",-1

Bites all over my chest - took eight days for them to go away. Worst flight ever - contacted United to alert them to this problem. United offered $150 as a ""Goodwill Offer.""

This may be the only airline in the world to treat a nervous 19 year old girl with the most rude and unapologetic attitude. This was my first time flying alone so yes, I was a bit nervous.

I was traveling today with my son (who was sleeping on the stroller) and husband. Before we enter immigration at the entrance we met these two ground officers(women) who are checking bording passes. The one who took our bording passes looked at asked us to tell our names by showing each bording pass. We did as she said. But she asked us to repeat it. But we don't know why. My husband repeat it again also said we have to catch the flight at 10.45pm So let us go. (It was almost 10.30) she looked at me and said step back and take off my tiny purse which was hanging my neck and shoulder. So i had to step back and take off my backpack my jackets to take my purse and put it inside. I was just couple steps away from immigration. I know she wanted to make us uncomfortable in front of everyone.  We felt so helpless specialy when we had a sleeping baby with us. This made me so upset during whole flight. This is the first bad experience i ever had.,-1

I was charged $400 for two tickets to be changed, was hung up on while on hold three times by customer service people, and was told to call a different number which was an automated attendant.

2018-02-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Washington Dulles,2.0,,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1,very upset at this point,True,  Philadelphia to Washington Dulles. I am very upset at this point. I was scheduled to leave Philadelphia going to Washington then connecting to Atl. Flight 6319 was an hour late getting to Philadelphia. Intead of boarding at 7:25pm to depart at 7:50pm. Flight arrived at 8:35pm and plane took off at 9:08pm. We arrived in Washington 9:55pm or close to that time. Flight attendants reassured everyone that their connecting flights were still on time we would be fine. When I got to the gate for my connecting flight it was closed. No other flights are leaving out tonight. So I have to sleep in the airport. Catch a morning flight to Atl. The purpose of the email is communications should have been had between 6319 plane and 6322 plane. 6322 never knew of our delays so they proceeded to leave on schedule. I feel like just changing my flight and me sit and sleep over night in an airport is very insensitive. Poor customer service. I fly often and will never fly with United again. I was on a flight once yrs ago and there were a group of people on an international flight. That airline waited for their flight to land because they understood that the plane delays should not effect the passengers. I fault the staff and pilot for lack of communication. Hopefully this will bring about some change.,-1

Flew San Francisco to Tel Aviv. 787-800 at the Polaris first - Business seat 6B. United service is something I can't understand, they do the minimum during all flights. Right after takeoff most of the team disappear, during the long flight (15hr) I couldn't see air crew activity if you needed anything, the one at the galley was eating or reading emails. They forgot to give the amenity kit to 90% of the business class passengers, the plastic bags of blankets and water bottles left on my seat (at the seat upper storage area) were all over the flight and overall the Polaris that should be Business First is cozy and small for passenger above 185 cm with 2x2x2 configuration (meaning the window seat need to jump over you). Overall not a legacy airline at all, long way to go.",-1
2018-02-03,0.2,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Auckland,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3,don't care about service quality whatsoever,True," Flew San Francisco to Auckland with United Airlines. Check-in staff were unenthusiastic. Service at the United lounge was terrible. The male attendant at the reception desk had a bad attitude. Some of the flight attendants were lukewarm. Overall the attendants' service was nowhere near the Asian airlines, such as Singapore. Polaris business class is decent but still falls short of Singapore's quality. Onboard Wi-Fi was slow even when loading webpages, and they explicitly said streaming videos wasn't allowed. On airlines like China Eastern I could stream videos smoothly. Airlines like Singapore pay attention to every detail, such as the check-in staff. United falls short every here and there. After the mergers, United has monopolized tons of routes, so now they make money off of the monopoly and don't care about service quality whatsoever. Will not fly them other than on exclusive routes.",-1
2018-02-02,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Grand Rapids to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,losing credibility,True," Grand Rapids to Newark. I had a bad feeling when I booked with United but as this was for a job interview and I was asked to fly out in three days, I didn't have any other choice but to take whatever flights were available - my original sense of dread turned out to be justified and I certainly will not be flying with United again. The flight was scheduled to take off at 7:30 PM, it's 9:38 PM and I'm still here. Initially, they announced a 3 hour delay, then, figuring that wasn't inconvenient enough, they changed it to 4 hours. So instead of arriving at my destination at 9:30 PM as I was originally scheduled to do so, I will be getting in at 1:40 AM - no big deal. And of course the United employees at the kiosk make it quite clear through their laissez faire attitude, and at times downright rude behavior, that they really don't care about the fact that paying customers are waiting out a 4 hour delay. It's very obvious United doesn't give any thought to customer service. When asked what the issue is, they respond with ""Oh, the plane is undergoing maintenance."" Funny, I figured maintenance would be done routinely, not when it has the potential to ruin as many lives as possible. And, shouldn't there maybe be a backup plan? Is every single United plane currently being used with no consideration given to the possibility of unforeseen mishaps like this? I especially like the response I received from the snooty United employee when I asked if there were any other flights available - ""No, probably not..."" Probably not? Umm, do you mind checking perhaps? Which she begrudgingly did after I asked. Real problem solvers they got there. I'm also really glad I signed up for both their email and text message alerts regarding flight changes. I received neither. I'm sure they just didn't want to fill up my inbox or use up my monthly text message allowance. I suppose United figured this was the best way to earn back some respect. Nice job guys, this will certainly be my last flight with this airline. United has steadily been losing credibility amongst my circle of professional colleagues, and it's not difficult to see why.",-1
2018-02-01,0.9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Tampa to Washington via Denver,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,I thoroughly enjoyed the trip,True,"  This was a very pleasant weekend excursion to celebrate my birthday. I flew Tampa to Denver on Friday and then returned to TPA the next day via Washington Dulles. Check-in at TPA was immediate and simple, but Denver was another story. The Premier Access line was only 3 or 4 minutes long, but had I been a normal economy passenger, the line stretched interminably. Boarding for all three flights was disciplined and orderly; all flights pushed back early, departed promptly, and arrived ahead of schedule. On the TPA-DEN and DEN-IAD flights I had the forward, over-wing exit row window, with the middle seat unoccupied. On the IAD-TPA segment, the whole exit row was open, but I was upgraded to an aisle seat in first class. This experience confirmed for me that the exit row seats are the best in the plane and beat 1st class on narrow-body aircraft, particularly if one or both adjacent seats are unoccupied. On the DEN-IAD flight, I purchased the southwestern omelet for breakfast, and I was very pleased with the taste and the presentation. The crew on all flights were pleasant and efficient, my luggage arrived promptly, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip.",1

They have shrunk the width of the seats to such an extreme you feel crammed. There is literally no wiggle room and I'm not a large person. I feel sorry for the man next to me.

I was excited to try the Boeing 787  new Polaris at united. We had a nice welcome with the team and find my 6B seat The configuration is a bit tight- 2x2x2. Usually I see 1x2x1 in this 787 for business class. The seat was comfortable but the issue the for 185 cm and up- there is no space of your legs. Really disappointment.

I bought a ticket for my aunt who has Alzheimer's and bought her premium economy so she has more leg room and made sure she had an aisle seat to grab an attendant if she needed help. They moved her seat four times! Each time I had to call and say, she can not be put in economy, that is not what I paid for, and she can not be in a window seat! She has to be able to flag an attendant if she needs something! They tried putting her in a window seat, economy instead of premium economy, etc.. Dealing with a person that has Alzheimer's is bad enough, dealing with a horrible airline that I had to call several times to argue about why they cant move her seat is just horrible. They have notes in their system that she has this medical issue and I think they are trying to take advantage of that!",-1

Even though there was an issue with the WiFi they made sure everyone was able to log on quickly and gave iPads for those who couldn’t log on. Also we ended up confusing our flight that was on Alaska and a similar flight and time was at United. When we realized this at the United help desk it was too late to get to our Alaska flight within seconds they put us on their flight and offered to move our bags to that flight as well.  Also those German waffle cookie things are heaven.,1
2018-01-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Hong Kong via Newark,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,customer service is dismissive,True,"  Boston to Hong Kong via Newark. My flight BOS-EWR was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and I had a short connection in EWR to continue towards HKG. The customer service is unhelpful, as if the delay is your fault, not theirs. They refused to board me on an earlier flight, they could not offer re-routing nor sponsor the ticket with another airline to secure my journey. The delay was ultimately tight for my connection, but every UA representative I spoke to suggested the other flight would have likely waited. It did not. It left six minutes earlier than scheduled. Despite asking to the flight attendants while on flight whether my connection would have waited, the response was that United - differently from every other Star Alliance company - does not offer this ""service"". I landed and there was no representative to direct delayed passengers. I rushed to the gate to make the unpleasant discovery that my connection departed earlier. I thus went for the customer service. I stood on a line for 3h and 15m. Around 45 minutes after landing, a text message invited me to check-in for my next flight, from which I derived I was booked for the same flight the following day. After hours of waiting, I reached a representative that handed me a voucher for the hotel and US$ 30 for three meals: yes, $ 10 per meal. Not to mention, the hotel was sketchy and sub-standard. The flights were possibly the worst I have ever experienced in 14 years of flying. In over 16h flight (plus boarding, taxing, etc.) they serve two microscopic meals and one snack. No snacks in the galley. Never seen such misery. The crew was confrontational at all stages. They said: ""We are nice to people who are nice to us"", which is reasonable in abstract, but they seem to forget we are not fellow travellers! I am the customer, they are the flight attendants. As I have reached my final destination over 25h later than initially scheduled, I sought compensation from United. Unsurprisingly, their customer service is dismissive. I was told I can buy insurance next time. I do have insurance, but they cover unforeseeable events, not negligence of the carrier. I have been trying to hold them liable under the Montreal Convention, but so far all they offer are pointless vouchers in the illusion that I would ever subject myself again to the pain of dealing with such an unpleasant, unprofessional, unapologetic company. United airlines punishes you for making the unwise choice of traveling with them. Despite you pay for a service, they drop on you the cost of their inefficiency. Leaving aside old aircrafts, primitive forms of IFE that have disappeared in the rest of the world, broken controls, dirty and hard seats, meals that not even if you live out stamps. The point is the lack of consideration, the way they treat a paying customer at every stage of the experience, from check in to customer service when you try to claim damages for the disservice they caused you. Finally, UA cheats selling tickets with connecting time they cannot really respect or guarantee. They are cheating to rank higher on search engines with prices and journey duration. On any international flight, make sure you have 2.5h connecting time minimum. Few reviews will tell you UA is less worse than they say: don't gamble with it. Choose better.",-1
2018-01-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Oklahoma City,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,It was a horrible experience!,True,"  Houston to Oklahoma City. I have flown United twice now and both times were awful. They had an issue getting us checked in and because of that, we didn't get checked in before the 30 minute requirement on international flight so they wouldn't let us on our flight. Then on the way back, our flight was cancelled. Their customer service representatives do not care and are rude. Their flight attendants are rude. They do not care that your flight was cancelled and you need to get home because you have kids, work etc. They didn't even want to give us a food or beverage voucher. I will never use United again. It was a horrible experience!",-1

At the airport they said I could only check 1 bag. When I ask why they were rude, not wanting to help at all. They were unable to explain why, they start yelling and keep being rude. I will never fly with them again. I asked for a wheelchair because of a knee problem and they took forever to get somebody, I had to ask 4 times. They were rude again and told me I could start walking or wait until they had time to call the wheelchair person. If I paid for a service they should provide the service, not have a bad attitude with their clients. Not helpful at all. I wont fly with United Airlines again.",-1
2018-01-23,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh Durham to Chicago,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4,"nice, friendly and helpful",True,"  Raleigh Durham to Chicago. United Economy Plus has a significant advantage in its legroom comparing to regular United Economy seats. A dedicated overhead compartment was provided for Economy Plus passengers, meaning I did not have to fight over someone for a space in order to accommodate my carry-on baggage. The seats were narrow, and were poorly padded. Only non-alcoholic drinks were provided free of charge, when alcoholic drinks and snacks were available for purchase. I have attempted to use the inflight entertainment, which did not work since it could not read any credit card in my wallet. I bought the inflight Wi-Fi. It did work and managed to provide a decent speed (fast enough for internet browsing and photo sharing apps). The cabin crew on my flight were nice, friendly and helpful. Overall, United Economy is a acceptable product for flights that are 4 hours or under. However if I am flying intercontinental, I would consider flying another carrier, since the same seat product is applied to all planes in UA's fleet.",-1
2018-01-23,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Omaha NE to Toronto ON via Chicago IL,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,1,A complete disaster,True," A complete disaster. First leg (Toronto to O'Hare) on Saturday had a lavatory problem - so we pushed back (got that on time departure) only to sit for a while and then return to the gate. But since it was an int'l flight we were not allowed off the plane and the CSR refused to get on the plane. Eventually left 99 minutes late even though FAA's MFR rules do not require a working lav. On return flight first leg (Omaha to Chicago) Sunday we arrived early but there our gate was occupied so we sat for an hour, even though you could see multiple empty gates at terminal. Connection flight was very tight and when we ran to the new gate we found it had left 10 minutes early. So much for that thing known as customer service. I am a frequent flyer (about 100 legs a year) and a Star Alliance Gold Member, but this is the last straw (United has messed me over before). American, Southwest, anyone but United when US travel is required. If there was a zero rating - that's what I would pick.",-1

I have never given a bad review to anyone but the ground crew at this airline was beyond rude yesterday. Flying with one additional adult and two children (two and four years) and they expect that the kids can sit by themselves! The seats numbers were 7, 9, 10 and 20! Not only did they not help with the seating they were passing rude comments throughout ""Ma'am you're making this more complicated than it already is."" ""Didn't you hear, I just made the announcement"". I heard ""no"" at least 10 times in 10 minutes. The lady was not only curt to me she responded very impolitely to the other passenger just requesting a seat. I am not flying United again if I can avoid it.",-1

2018-01-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Fresno to San Diego,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,waiting and waiting and waiting,True," Absolute worst airline I've ever flown with. I had a bad experience with them in the past, but this was the only flight returning to Seattle from Fresno that I could find. Both flights (my flight to SFO, and the connecting flight from SFO to SEA) were delayed at least an hour, if not more. In SFO we were supposed to leave at 8.40pm, but were delayed. However, we still boarded even more passengers, and were told we would be taking off at 9.10pm. But, because we continued boarding we didn't leave the ground until after 9.30pm. No explanation was made by the captain or the flight crew, but there we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. The flight was hot and stuffy. I also was incredibly annoyed with the baggage policy. When I booked my flight, there was no communication that I couldn't bring a carry on bag. As this was a very short trip, I brought just a carry on and my personal item. But when I checked in, I was informed I couldn't have one and needed to have it checked, for an additional $25, and that I couldn't even check it at the gate. I've never in my life, been told this before. I literally had to rethink everything I packed and how I packed it, as I had a layover and needed to do homework. When I got to the United booth at FAT to drop off my now checked bag, there was no one there, and the other customer and I waited ten minutes for them to return, again with no explanations. The kicker was when I got to the gate and everyone who had a carry-on bags was given a tag (no additional charge) for their tagged bag! Coupled with so many other things that went wrong today, having a horrible flight experience was the worst thing that could have happened. So take heed, if you fly Basic Economy, you have to a) pay a $25 checked bag for an otherwise acceptable carry-on bag on any other airline, and b) if you fail to check the bag there is an additional $25 fee on top of the checked bag fee if you check it at the gate. Absolute swindle. You buy a cheap flight because you can afford it, but then you have to pay extra for something every other basic airline ticket allows you to have. If I can possibly avoid it, I will never fly with them again.",-1

",True," 
Flew United from Buenos Aires to Newark. Unfortunately this flight service was by far the worst I've ever had. Food in general is awful but when they came to my seat, the option would have been chicken or beef. The attendant said to me your option is only beef or beef. I looked at him like, what? He laughed and said sorry and my response was I'm sorry but I do not eat beef. His response was literally ""you can eat the stuff around the beef"". Mind you, I had seen a flight attendant come up and grab five chicken entrees before the serving was finished. I asked him if there was anyway to get chicken as I honestly don't eat beef nevermind eating around what the plate had. It had nothing except powdered mashed potatoes. This was a ten hour flight, I wasn't going to starve because of the lack of organization. In the end a flight attendant overheard how upset I was and they gave one of the ones they had taken. I know it is not the flight attendants fault at all but at least be respectful of others dietary needs. Our flight cost enough even on economy to provide us with better food services.",-1

I was traveling with my daughter and 5 year old grandson. The airline had changed our flight but did not give us the same seats, which had put us not flying together. We talked to the United person at the gate which he changed our seats and were very helpful in accommodating and put us together. Once on the plane for the 11hr flight home the flight attendants were very rude. At one point we were snapped at because we hadn’t filled out the entry to the US card on time. I believe she screamed at us and said “you had 11 hours to do this.” Never been on a flight with such a display of rudeness from flight attendants. Do not believe I will be using this airline in the future!",-1
2018-01-17,1.0,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Portland,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,went above and beyond,True,"  Chicago to Portland. We were super disappointed with American Airlines. The problem was coming from Detroit to Chicago trying to connect to Portland. Our plane was a smidge late getting into Chicago but wasn’t a big deal because we had an hour and a half between flights. We spent 1 hour driving around the airport. The other flight was behind and we didn’t have a place to port. So we missed our connecting flight. We had to check bags in valet so we had to wait for that but they lost our bag. I But the lady was super rude and told us it wasn’t their fault and was convinced we never valet our bag. Even though I had the receipt and the claim voucher. When we asked the lady at the counter to call down and ask them to hold the connecting door for seriously only 3 or 4 minutes, she said no - we sprinted down there to find out that they closed the door early. We go to counter to get new flights, they were rude, and wouldn’t comp any meals or hotel or anything. They booked us on a United flight that left 14 hours later. We went down to check in with United since we had a million hours to kill. United Airlines not only gave us food vouchers, they put us up on cots and gave us toiletries for free. They upgraded our seats, then had a person personally escort us to the United club so we could sleep for the night. They then tracked down our missing bag and paid to have it delivered to our house the same day we arrived home. Plus their WiFi worked in board. And they have really good cookies too. Basically United went above and beyond to accommodate when it wasn’t even their fault. We were super super pleased by them and all their staff! Congrats United. You just earned yourselves lifetime customers!",1

I’ve taken this airline about four times because of how cheap it is let’s just say the cheaper the ticket the absolute horrible service! I have missed my connecting flight four times because of delays! Last night I took united from Boston to Washington DC as soon as I got off the plane I ran for the next airplane which was taking me to NC when I arrived it said now boarding I asked him to open the door because technically I was on time and they refused they were super rude they yelled at me I am in the service so I need it to be back before certain time they refuse to let me talk to anyone else to get for their assistance I ended up having to take a vehicle and drive to North Carolina absolutely horrible I will never ever ever take this airplane ever again ! And I’ve never been refunded for missing my flights which I have nothing to do with,-1

I understand, you can not control the weather, but the people at the customer service you can. Ruth, offensive, unprofessional, unpleasant in Chicago O'Hare. I was upset, due to 12 hours delay, and tried to talk to them to find sooner connection to Toronto. You paid for your check in luggage, wait in Chicago for 7 hours and sure enough your bag is not deliver. None of the people from the flight from Maui to Chicago got their checked bags. Onboard nothing is offered. United you lost our business for sure.",-1

Recently flew Denver to Tampa in first and back in coach. Overall a good experience with excellent staff in Denver who helped me change my ticket due to urgent change in plans. Lounges could be a bit better in terms of food. On board all the crews were friendly and smiling and seemed to want to help passengers. Both flights totally full but boarded on time with early arrivals on both sides despite bad weather all over USA. I think the first class food experience could be a bit better but its fair in coach where you can buy what you want. Crews seemed patient dealing with a few difficult passengers. Wi-fi worked great in both directions.,1

The worst airline I’ve ever had to deal with. We knew we were getting sleet and ice since 3am. Waited on the runway for 2 hours to finally take off to Chicago and missed our flight from Chicago to Mexico. They state they will not pay for our stay since we leave tomorrow morning. Weather is out of your control. But being prepared for that weather is not. Will never fly with United after this trip.,-1

It is surprising how incompetent a company can be. I called to have my return flight changed from 12-30 to 12-27 for a family emergency. The agent charged me $200. On 12/27, I went to check-in, realized my return flight hadn't been changed, and I called them. After sitting on hold for an hour and a half, the agent was extremely rude and told me she couldn't change my flight to that same day because the fare difference was too large. Since then I have sat on hold for a total of five hours, talked to several different agents who claimed they recorded the information and sent it along to the complaint department. I finally found out nothing had been recorded, so I submitted a complaint online. When someone finally reached me, she offered a $100 voucher. My original ticket was worth $400, they completely messed that up, were rude about it, and I sat on hold for hours to resolve the issue because of their lack of communication between departments. Now I'm left with half a ticket, leaving me no choice but to fly with these people again.",-1

We heard of inclement weather happening on our return trip so we called the airline and paid to have our tickets changed to an earlier flight. Now, we are stuck at our connection and will be arriving home close to the same time we were originally scheduled after the inclement weather has already hit. A waste of time, a waste of money. We literally could have spent an entire day working in D.C. but because of the ineptitude of this airline we lost a full day. This happened on our flight out as well, delayed in Denver. It seems that United cannot be held accountable to their own schedule.",-1
2018-01-11,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington Dulles to Hong Kong,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,,2.0,2,so rude and defensive,True,"  Washington Dulles to Hong Kong. Not a lot of choices to fly from Hong Kong to the US, Unfortunately, the cheapest was United. Due to the holiday season, the tickets were expensive so this was my only option. My first flight from DC to SF as delayed, and I had a connecting flight so I almost missed it, we stayed on the plane for 3 hours before takeoff. Whenever I asked the flight attendants about it, they were so rude and defensive and seemed unwilling to help me. The plane was so old and dirty and no leg room. The international flight from SF to HK was also delayed though not the airline's fault. I think the service and flight attendants on international flights are way better than the domestic ones. They had a good selection of movies, though the food was just average. Overall for the price I paid I say it wasn't worth it, and I wouldn't want to fly with United again.",-1

Delayed in St. Louis by an hour and that caused me to miss my flight in Houston. Customer Service had an attitude when trying to get the next flight to where I was going and they made me sit at Houston airport for 8 hours. Finally get to my plane after sitting in Houston for that long and I am standing in line and they had to apparently “drain the lavatory” which then delayed that flight another 30 minutes. Over priced for the kind of service you receive. It is no wonder why Southwest does as well as it does. Avoid this airline at all costs.,-1

After all the negative publicity United Airlines has received, I must call them out for giving me such a great experience! First off, the flight was delayed and I decided to get a snack from a vending machine. It got stuck. One of the pilots and a stewardess helped me get it out without me even asking. I hadn't noticed they were also waiting for the delayed flight. They helped us with our puppy getting used to the plane, and when I got sick, they came quickly with a sick-bag and a cup of ginger-ale. So, they showed me very good service, were very friendly, and went the extra mile.",1

Don't fly United if you have a service animal. They put me in the middle seat with no where for my animal to sit or stand. So the entire flight she was forced in my lap.

However, they always starve me saying that I haven't notified the airline about my special meal. Crew are always rude and do not make any effort to provide me with suitable food. I am sure they have other food options suitable for vegetarians but they just get away with a sorry! I would never fly United.",-1

Firstly for a flight of 7-8 hrs the Boeing 757 is a small plane with little or no leg space and cramped up passengers cos seats are 3-3. Thus each time I need to go to washroom both middle seat and isle seat passengers need to get out of their seats too which is really inconvenient to all passengers. Secondly there was no inflight entertainment despite the crew restarting the system several times which is outrageous for a long haul flight. Furthermore, there was no apology from crew until the flight landed in Heathrow where the crew finally apologised and said passengers to go online and get an appreciation voucher from United. This when I did that it gave me a USD100 discount code on any United Airlines with many conditions attached to it, unfortunately I won’t be flying United again at any cost, therefore even this voucher is of no use. On positive side I landed safely and food and drinks was ok for an international flight.",-1

United apply the recipe of discount airlines to long flight and this is not going well. Their organisation in Newark airport is chaotic. The entertainment system look like it's from the 90's (Ridiculously small screen and no possibility of movies selection). The inflight service is minimum and/or replaced by paying service.

My husband and I flew round trip from Tulsa to Los Angeles with a connecting flight in Houston, TX. The trip there wasn't too bad other than the fact that they had t.v,s on the seat in front of you with direct t.v. and a remote control on the armrest. The problem was most of the remotes didn't work, and you couldn't change the channel. It was ridiculous. We didn't mind too much though, because we were more excited for our trip than concerned with our 4 hour flight stuck on one channel we didn't choose. The real problem came during our trip. We were supposed to fly back from LAX at 10 pm on December 31, 2017. We got an email late at night on the 29th, we didn't even see it until the morning of the 30th, saying our flight was changed. Just like that they changed our flight to 12:50am on the 30th. We lost basically a whole day that we had already planned out with relatives with basically no notice because they overbooked the flight. But we went anyway. At the airport almost 30 people were on standby for our flight. Then we were delayed over an hour. Then we flew to Houston, TX for a two hour layover. Then back on a plane to Tulsa. It made for a very long, very angry night. I'd pay an extra $150 a ticket or more before I'd ever fly United again. They do not care about their customers or our plans. This was a terrible experience.",-1

I have a connecting flight here in San Francisco, I arrived 4 hours before my connection leaves. I looked at a departures board and noticed another United flight left in just an hour. Went to the United customer service desk to see if I could switch. The woman at the counter didn't have the decency to great me with a hello and before I even finished asking my question she told me there was nothing I could change at all. Her response was simply ""no changes"". I went to the gate and asked if there were seats available, the gate attended said ""possibly"" then looked at my ticket and informed the contract I signed when booking basic economy forbid me from changing flights. I asked ""even if there are empty seats on an earlier flight?"" And she said ""no changes can be made with this ticket if it were economy I might be able to do something"". I'm happy the gate employee at least explained my situation but this is ridiculous. United wanted to charge me another $35 for this trip to be economy. I paid $75 so that's nearly a increase. I understand I bought a cheap ticket, that's why I wasn't even allowed a carry on bag. However, when there's something as simple as putting a passenger, with no carry on or checked luggage, on the same size aircraft going to the same destination and United won't do it. That's ridiculous. It wouldn't cost them a dime more but I wasn't at the right paygrade for the company to care. Basically what I heard from United today was ""give me money and I'll give a sh*t about you"". Needless to say, they won't be getting my business in the future.",-1

You cannot even take on a carry on, you must check your bag if you are in this class. My flight was cancelled due to inclement weather, and there was barely any flexibility in my flight change (had to be moved to the next day, but very limited in support), zero flexibility in allowing a carry on even though more time had been accrued, and very little acknowledgment of the difficulty that arises with a flight cancellation. I fly often, within the US and internationally. If I can help it, I will never fly United again.",-1

Today is just another frustrating flight on United. 5.30pm flight already delayed until 8pm. Wont be suprised if flight gets cancelled. Last time I flew United I actually rented a car at midnight in Denver and drove 8 hours home rather than get stranded in Denver for 1.5 days with no hotel or any compensation. When I was flying from Pierre SD to Billings years ago they would often cancel flights for ""mechanical reasons"" and make you stay another day so they could fill planes. I try to avoid UAL, but they have a monopoly on some flights. Delta and NorthWest Airlines have always been excellent if possible. UAL is the worst!",-1

We found both legs of our flight on an A319 from Albany to Chicago and our 777-200 flight from Chicago to San Francisco to be outstanding. Check in and boarding was painless. Drinks were served within a minute of us taking our seats while the crew was friendly, professional and positive. Albany to Chicago was a quick flight with the seats great, inflight entertainment working well etc. The second leg on the 777-200 was everything and then some. Yes we had to sit to wait to be de-iced for almost 45 minutes, no problem,. Crew was equally as friendly on our second leg, flight 470 from Chicago to San Francisco. Every 10-15 minutes they were around to offer drinks, blankets or see if we needed anything. Some complain about the new Polaris seating, not sure why, we found them to have plenty of room, while lying flat or in any position. The breakfast was really great with a protein or spinach egg white option, both served with fresh fruit, soft biscuit and Greek yogurt. Really have to say United did a very nice job today! Only reason I didn’t give 5 stats for inflight entertainment was no live tv without paying, still plenty of movie options though. Luggage came out fast, all in all a great experience!",1

It started off as follows: we booked a flight from Montreal to San Francisco with a connecting flight in Newark. Upon arriving in San Francisco, we noticed that both mine and my husband’s luggage were nowhere to be found. They said that his was still in Newark and mine apparently was in San Francisco (at the airport). They couldn’t locate my bag for 3 full days. We had to spend out of pocket for all kinds of clothes and toiletries (putting a major damper on our time in San Fran). They only delivered my husbands luggage two days later. To make matters worse, when locating where my luggage was, I told them that I would pick it up at the airport later in the day, as we had a wine tour in Napa scheduled. We passed by the airport later in the evening only to be told that my luggage was now on a flight to LA. Myself nor my husband ever told them to go ahead and do that! Their level of efficiency and service is extremely poor and I wouldn’t ever recommend them to anyone.

They made me shell $25 to check my bag that I've literally never had a problem with in overheads in dozens of times flying, even on smaller planes. I'm 90% sure they shrink the requirement test basket so people have to give them more money. United may often be the cheapest airlines but they will get the rest of the money out of you somehow.

2018-01-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Myrtle Beach,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1, has caused a problem,True,"  Newark to Myrtle Beach. Once again, United Airlines has caused a problem. Not only did we have a nightmare experience on the out flight from MYR to Newark, the return flight experience was a nightmare as well. Resulting in my 2 children, who are flying together (17 years and 13 years old) to miss their flight. United Airlines allowed 2 minors to miss a flight. Even tho they were there when they needed to be. The check in process took so long, along with the security check thru process, that caused a major delay in there progress. Not only did they miss there flight, but now they have to wait until the following day, to experience this terror again. How is it that a major commercial airline, only has 1 flight a day. How is it that a multi billion dollar company, cannot take action, to get 2 minor children in a different flight. Instead, they make them travel back, a 2 hour travel, to do it again. First off, the ""Unaccompanied Minor"" charge is fraud. When booking these tickets, the website said nothing about added fees. The tickets were bought and paid for, and while attempting to do the check in process, United Airlines slams people with added fees. On the day of a flight. That is not ok. I get a voucher for our initial troubles (which We were under the assumption that could be used for the return flight fees) and got denied that as well. A $150 ticket, turned well over 400 dollars by the time this was said and done. Only for my children to miss a return flight, due to the faulty set up of United Airlines .",-1

My husband and I flew out Christmas Eve and flew back New Years Eve and both experiences were terrible. Both had layovers in Chicago flying from Kalamazoo to Denver. The flight out got delayed 6 hours. We updated our connecting flight due to the delay and were supposed to have an hour in ORD before boarding our plane to DEN. However, our United flight spent half an hour searching for a gate causing us to almost miss our connecting flight. Additionally, our checked bag was lost and had to be delivered. It was also not delivered at the time it was promised. On our flight back, we got out of DEN fine, but arrived at ORD at 12 and with our connecting flight leaving at 3.45. Due to United's incompetence, we were stuck in the airport on NYE until 6.10 and did not make it home until hours after we were supposed to. It was 2 miserable days of traveling and United offered nothing to compensate for these errors that ruined our holidays. Do not fly United if you actually wish to get where you're going even remotely on time.",-1

2017-12-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Washington to Los Angeles,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,2,disappointing experience,True,"  Washington to Los Angeles in January 2017. Arrived from another UA flight and the transfer in IAD was eventtless. After a rubbish experience in MCO, I gave the UA Club lounge another try, as IAD is UA’s hub, but the same disappointing experience, although the lounge was more modern and had a nicer design than the one in MCO. However, food items offered again very poor, just soup, salads, some poor looking highly processed cheese cubes and crackers and some veggies with dip; self service beverages items limited to water, coffee and tea; others were served at a manned bar and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks, even for domestic beers. No cash is accepted, except of course for tips which are expected. The flight to LAX was initially announced as being on time, but 10 minutes after boarding should have commenced, a delay of boarding has been announced due to a maintenance issue (change of tire), but still no official delay has been announced. This is especially irritating as UA’s boarding procedure requires all passengers (including children, First Class and Priority) to line up in 5 different queues according to boarding groups like applicants for a free handout before boarding starts. So, instead of waiting seated for boarding to begin, people were standing in line or sitting on the floor for the boarding to begin. Also, the flight turned out to be overbooked. Boarding than started with a delay of twenty minutes. Departure was finally delayed 60 minutes, as in addition to maintenance issue, we had to wait for the baggage to be loaded. Pretty incompetent procedure. On board, classic first class domestic recliner seats in a 2x2 set up. Seats were big but surprisingly hard, so again not that comfortable. The plane had direct tv on a mini screen, but no headphones provided, so useless. Dinner was “chicken”, “salmon” or “vegetarian pasta”, no further information given, no menus provided. Starter was a rocket salad and dessert a sundae. Found the food uninspired and barely edible. Lights were off during the whole (early evening) flight - even during meal service - FA's best part of flight, however FA’s were professional. 30 minutes arrival delay into LAX. The wait for the arrival of the luggage was ok, but priority luggage came out whenever. Finally, UA also managed to mistreat my luggage (broken handle). Was told by UA, that this is not their problem or responsibility. No refinement in UA's service and the word ""please"" is clearly not part of UA vocabulary, as I did not hear it to be used once by any of their employees in the air or on the ground. How is this a First Class experience? My default airline for domestic US flights is AA, and they provide a much better overall product.",-1
2017-12-31,0.4,Solo Leisure,First Class,Orlando to Washington,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,,1.0,2,not a first class experience,True,"  Orlando to Washington in January 2017 on a Boeing 767-400. Although this flight encountered no major irregularities this was not a first class experience. Check in - even for F - was through automated kiosks only. Short line, but taking longer than necessary through to the need to go through many screens focusing on upselling (e.g. to buy UA miles, even if one is not member of the UA frequent flyer program- thoughtless, unnecessary and irritating). UA did not provide TSA priority access at MCO for First Class passengers, but the overall wait was tolerable, as the line was moving fast in spite of many, many people standing in line. Visited UA Club Lounge, which was very basic and food items offered during lunch time poor especially when compared to lounges operated by non U.S. airlines, soup, salads, some poor looking highly processed cheese cubes and crackers and some veggies with dip; self service beverages items limited to water, coffee and tea; others were served at a manned bar and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks, even for domestic beers. No cash is accepted, except of course for tips which are expected. Rubbish and useless lounge. Also, was only allowed into the lounge as I had Star Gold status with an other airline. A First Class ticket alone will not give you access. On board 2-1-2 seat layout, which looked like an international business cabin. Seats were lie-flat, but I was not able to find a comfortable lounging position and fully flat the seats looked claustrophobic. Not an issue for a two hour flight, but would have been very frustrated to end up in these seats on a transatlantic flight. Pre-flight drinks were served. Otherwise, just beverage service on this 2 hour lunch time flight, cabin service professional with FA’s present in the cabin and trying to give good service with the limited options UA gave them, so flight experience was ok, without being great and nowhere close to a first or business class experience. On a positive note, there was IFE available (AVOD with good screens and nice selection of movies), which could be used before takeoff till touchdown. Flight arrived on time in IAD, despite a 15 minutes hold over IAD due to a medical emergency on another plane.",-1
2017-12-30,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kalispell to Charlotte via Denver,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,3,disgusted with United Airlines,True,"  Kalispell to Charlotte via Denver. Due to weather delay, we had to reschedule flights to the next day. Three family members were traveling economy and needed to stay together for travel reasons after arriving to the home airport. The arrangement we were given conflicted with family plans so we tried to get on other flights. Two were given seats on specified flights, but I was told there were no seats available. There were many economy plus seats available and I suggested that I pay the extra fee for one of those seats. I was told that as an economy client, I didn't qualify for the seat. I spoke to five different agents including a supervisor and always offered to pay the uncharge. I was refused. That night, I upgraded my current seat to economy plus. The next day, I asked another agent and she gave me seats on the flight with my family! Was she nice or did my upgrade then make me suitable for a placement on the flight. That is what I had been suggesting I do to all the agents. I am disgusted with United Airlines lack of concern for their ""economy"" travelers.",-1
2017-12-30,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Tel Aviv,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,3,very pleasantly surprised,True,"  Newark to Tel Aviv. After a long time I was flying on United and only because my preferred carrier was not available on this route. I was very pleasantly surprised by both the flights departing on time and arriving ahead of schedule. The 3-4-3 seating layout made for cramped conditions. You really were in constant shoulder touch with one of your fellow passengers! Leg space is barely sufficient. The back of the seat did not recline noticeably. Thanks to being in the aisle seat, I could stretch out my right leg at times. Boarding at both airports were smoothly organized by boarding groups and overhead luggage space was ample. Individual flight entertainment systems were easy to use and they had a good collection of Hollywood, Bollywood, Asian and European movies. Beer and wine were complimentary. Two meals were served, portions were small. Lot of special meals -- kosher, Asian vegetarian, etc -- were delivered by frazzled flight attendants running up and down to match meals with passengers. The plan announcements in English and Hebrew were overly loud and frequent. The toilets were reasonably clean given the nearly 11 hours flight. There were snacks in the galley to pick on. Small bottles of water were available aplenty. All-in-all, a well-managed, though crowded flight.",1

I immediately opened a luggage claim. Today is the 26th of December and they still don’t know where my bag is. I am on my honeymoon without my bag. I am calling everyday the baggage resolution center and everyday they tell me that they need more time. No words for the incompetence of this airline.

Didn’t realize economy class would treat me like a second class citizen. Hated how I was treated and wanted to pay for business class and they did not allow for upgrades. I used miles and never flown United and didn’t know it would be like this. Southwest is way better and cheaper. I will use them in the future like I always have.,-1
2017-12-27,0.8,Business,Economy Class,London to San Francisco,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,very clean and everything was working,True," Flew United from London Heathrow to San Francisco. Check-in was sluggish largely because passengers in front were attempting to travel with massively overweight bags. But once they were gone it went smoothly. Heathrow security was, unusually, working quickly and the staff were even smiling. Unfortunately there was a 15 minute walk to the gate. Boarding was a little confused having been selected for an extra TSA check. This meant that I circumnavigated the ticket process. They then asked why I was on the aircraft. It also seemed slightly pointless because they swabbed one of my laptops without noticing that I was carrying two. I’m totally in favour of tight security but this exercise seemed counterproductive. Boarding was otherwise very efficient. It was a new aircraft – very clean and everything was working. A good selection of movies and an easy-to-understand IFE. I like the Boeing 787. The lighting is perfect, air conditioning pleasant and ample overhead locker space. I usually travel business and was not looking forward to travelling at the very back of the aircraft but I was pleasantly surprised. The cabin crew were excellent – friendly, funny and assiduous in their duties. There was no problem with asking for more wine and the food was delicious. Another pleasant surprise was the lack of annoying announcements – a lesson some Middle East airlines could learn. The flight left on time and arrived early. Given how cheap the ticket was, it is difficult to find anything at fault with this flight. United should be proud of its cabin crew who excelled themselves.",1
2017-12-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Palm Springs,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,made my life hell,True," Portland to Palm Springs. Pathetic, just pathetic. I was traveling with an infant on Christmas day and United made my life hell. The flight from Portland was supposed to start at 6 AM. They made us sit in the flight until 8 AM. My connection flight at SFO missed. They made us travel to Santa Ana. Because there were no flights to PSP, since the connection flight left. We had to hire a car at Santa Ana and travel additional 150 miles to PSP over car using personal expenses. We started at PDX early morning at 6 AM and will be reaching PSP at 8 PM loosing our valuable Christmas time with family. Is ur CEO even listening? I promise that I will never ever travel thru United again",-1
2017-12-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charleston to Salt Lake City,2.0,,3.0,,,4.0,2,recommend staying away from them,True,"  Charleston to Salt Lake City. I booked a flight with United 2 months ago and my flight was re-routed over month in advanced before the flight and yet United failed to inform me. So we showed up to the airport at 6:00am to find our original flight didn’t exist and we were too late to board the new flight. The reason the flight didn’t exist is because United stopped service with our connecting city of Houston for a few months, so we were re routed through Chicago. We then had to come back for a 4:00pm flight instead of the intended 7:00am flight. This we had to pay for an extra Uber trip to and from the airport, we missed our car rental and wasted hours of our day. The entire situation would have been avoided if United had simply informed us that the flight had been changed and made sure we knew! It is now a few days before our return flight and I called United customer service and they have no idea about the re-routing and flight changes. So I am unable I find out the information on our flight going back to Charleston. I am blown away that United is this incredibly disorganized. Not only did they change our flight and not tell us, but their systems don’t even show when they no longer offer flights between two cities and their customer service had no idea that we were previously re-routed for that reason. Our current tickets still show flying through Houston on their end. I’m blown away by United’s incompetence. I definitely recommend staying away from them.",-1
2017-12-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Seattle,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,rude and uncalled for,True,"  Houston to Seattle. On the way to Houston we were grounded for over an hour after we were supposed to take off from a mechanical problem (scary) but hey it happens can't blame bad timing but on the way back after booking our tickets in a year in advance for a family of 5 for the return trip they ended up over booking the flight for the second time in a row (both coming and going to our destination). They ended up scrambling our seats so we had to sit at opposite sides of the plane. When I asked the lady why our seats had be switched she replied in the rudest tone possible told me ""if I would have just read the fine print we wouldn't be having this conversation"" - if it wasn't an airport I would have not just taken my seat. Absolutely rude and uncalled for, did not want to explain what was going on. It is what it is though I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone and will pay the extra $50 to fly Alaska from now on!",-1

I will try to avoid using United Airlines if its not a last minute option. Being a 5'7 male doesn't help at all since the seat is very tight. Food was horrible. Rice and chicken were dry with low quality sauce. Mango sorbet tasted horrible. IFE on my seat didn't work properly while service was okay. Lots of friendly chat with fellow attendants while not so friendly with passengers its more like let me do my job and thats it. Cabin looked tired. Not much left to be desired, just the same horrible experience I had 6 years ago on a memorable 16 hours mind exhausting flight.",-1

I was flying back home from college and had packed so much that I couldn't fit my laptop back in my bag and left it on the plane. The night I got back, I woke up at 3am in a panic, realizing what I had done and filled out their lost baggage online form. To my surprise, I got a text back from United no less than 5 minutes later (at 3am – great service!) that said they had found it and gave me the option to pick it up or have it shipped to me. I chose to pick it up that morning from SFO and the woman working at the service desk in United's baggage claim terminal was extremely helpful – I had my laptop back in about 2 minutes! After doing what I never thought I would – leaving my laptop on the plane United provided me with excellent service on Christmas Eve and returned it back to me. Thank you United and thanks to their lost and found department!",1

Awful, 4 cracked flights 18 hours of layovers - no compensation, hotel or refund. Sleeping on the floor on Christmas Eve in Denver with 77 other passengers! Worst airline ever!

Outbound to Baton Rouge from Austin They tried to rip me off on baggage. I was told by reservations the laptop would not be a 3rd item. When I arrived to board the plane I was told I could not board with 3 bags. The laptop was a 3rd bag. Really? They finally allowed me to board. Inbound to Austin via Houston I thought I would need to check 3 bags. $25 for first, $35 for 2nd and $150 for third. Seriously? I was able to combine. Thank Goodness. Flight from Baton Rouge was delayed. The airline did not notify my connecting United flight so they could wait. Houston is a large airport. No courtesy. I will never fly United again.",-1
2017-12-24,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Pittsburgh,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1,Frequent significant delays,True,"  Houston to Pittsburgh. Frequent significant delays. We have been delayed several times with United- once for seven hours due to no plane, then no crew, then other issues- we had about 10 updates to our departure time, so terrible estimates. Major issues like not having a plane? Isn’t this an airline company? Isn’t that your entire business? A two hour delay seems pretty standard. Yes the flights are cheaper, but if you need or want to depart on time don’t bother with United. Also, twice now the departure time has changed after booking before check in.

Her tone of voice was rude and not helpful. Ticket changing services for emergency situations are not permitted unless you pay an upgrade fee of $25 and then $200 flight ticket change and also the difference in ticket rate.

None of them were friendly or helpful whatsoever.

Not only did we almost not make it on the flight due to overbooking, but we missed our connection due to late arrival. We were lied to over three times when we landed in Houston. The flight attendant told us we would make our connection so we ran there to find out the gate was closed before we even got off our first flight. Each person we talked to was very rude and blamed everything on the weather, holidays or us the consumer. I have never had a worst experience with customer service. This whole thing is horrible. The lady that gave us our flights for the next day gave us a discount for a hotel. Needless to say I didn’t put a hotel stay in Houston in my budget. I will never fly United ever again and the only way they can make up for giving me the worst start to my vacation is a full refund. I didn’t pay to have to starve in an airport for 6hrs while I wait to fly to Denver and then finally to my destination.",-1

This airline will get you from point A to point B but not much more. You can see a big difference between flying an airline like Emirates and then flying United. Their customer service is very poor. One male flight attendant from SFO-SYD clearly didn't like his job at all. I asked for water because I wasn't feeling well and he made no attempt to get it, he had a sour look on his face the whole flight and he would just look at you instead of asking ""what drink would you like"" etc. Everything seemed like a hassle to him and every interaction with him was awkward. The airline is acceptable but if you have the money, fly any other airline with a better reputation).",-1

Bought a connecting flight for my return to Miami. The first plane arrived at EWR late and the airplain taking us to Miami departed early. When we wen to customer service for accomodations, they booked us (my daughter and I) on a flight that didn’t even take us to Miami, it took us to Ft Lauderdale instead and they sat my daughter ten seats away from me. My bags were delivered to Miami on the wrong flight. I am writing this review from Newark to Ft Lauderdale. My plane leaves at 10:06. I am hoping I can have my bag delivered when I get to Fort Lauderdale. My bags are some where now in Miami International Airport. United Airlines had poor logistics coordination. Customer service agents are not caring, and they remove themselves from the responsibility of answering a simple question. I purchased a connecting flight and because of their negligence I ended up paying for a hotel in New Jersey with no coats to protect ourselves from the cold. Me and my daughter stranded by this airline and they didn’t do anything to help us for this inconvenience. I know, I am never flying United again. This is the only way I express my frustration.",-1

This has honestly been the worst experience I have had with any airline. First, they make us pay to check our luggage, so if you think you're getting a good deal on your flight, think again. Then, the gate number changed 3 times during our layover in Houston with only 1 hour to spare and the gates were on exact opposite ends of the airport. My husband recently had bilateral hip replacement and was not able to sprint to either end of the airport in a timely fashion, so we consequently missed our flight. The woman at the check in was rude and told us we weren't paying attention, when in fact we were trying to run from the other end of the airport to make it in time. Then we went to customer service to attempt to reach some sort of resolution, and were met with hostility and deflection. We are now stuck at this airport until tomorrow afternoon.

They had me wait in line for 20 plus minutes after they knew I was already running late. As soon as I got up to the lady she tells me it is too late and I cannot get on the flight. I asked there has to be an alternative, and explained my roommate who I came with and was my ride also we showed up together at the same time and she was able to check her bags. I spoke with a supervisor as she told me the same thing, there is nothing they can do but put me on a 6pm flight (mind you it was 9am at this time) and I was originally on the 6pm flight and they moved me to the 9am flight because of weather delays in Philadelphia.

Not sure if I was singled out or not but I was forced to check-in my carry-on. I carried my suitcase for a reason, I didnt want to check it in. Already annoyed, I boarded the plane to find out that there were multiple issues with the plane causing us to wait onboard. After several hours they told us we could deplane, use the restrooms and grab a quick bite. Being one of the first off the plane, the lady at the door said with an attitude that if we weren't back when they close the doors then we were out of luck. I asked her if there was going to be an announcement. She said we will announce it at the door but not over the loud speaker. How can you say that to people that are deplaning? It's their duty to announce the closing of the gate so everyone that left can hear. Long story short, there was a 6 hour delay and we had to board a new plane. We were given $10 voucher for food but that couldnt even buy me a sandwich. I lost all of my daylight time at my destination. Annoyed about having to wait at baggage claim, once I recieved my carry-on I noticed all of the zippers were opened. This is not my idea of a vacation.",-1
2017-12-14,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Santa Ana to Ottawa,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,crew were unbelievably rude,True," Started with 1 hour and 45 min flight delay out to Santa Ana. The crew were unbelievably rude. Poor elderly folks trying to catch their connecting flights were trying to figure out what they should do and the advise is this, ""if it were me, I would get off the plane and find another day to fly"" or it was a short and impatient tone. The same crew responded to me in the same way when I asked if they could let the gate of the connecting flight know that I would be running almost a half a mile accross the airport to reach my connection. After running accross the airport and reaching my connecting gate, the guy manning the stand said I'm sorry they pulled the bridge back already, the plane had not even left yet. This was the last flight out for the night which led to me missing an event. The next day, the app made me walk a mile out of the way to the wrong terminal. I finally got on the plane and guess what, the plane happens to be the smallest plane available. To give you perspective, I am 6'7m, the height of the roof of the plane was about 5'8. To top it all off, my flight was 30 min delayed on my final departure. I will never again fly with United Airlines.",-1
2017-12-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Chicago O'Hare,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,United has already wasted my time,True," I have flown on countless airlines, internationally and domestically and today, I encountered the worst of my experiences with United Airlines 18 hours before I even needed to be at the airport. Upon receiving multiple emails reminding me that it was time to check in for my flight, I went to the website to check in only to be told that I could not. After multiple attempts on multiple devices, I finally received an email telling me to call United in order to check in. The associates informed me that I could not check in due to the fact that I had booked an economy ticket and did not have a checked bag. If I purchased a checked bag, I would be able to check in online. Please note that this policy change is new and it is buried in the fine print way down a page that can be accessed through a prompt that is in fine print, in a nearly transparent color. There is a red box on the page where you confirm your ticket that offers trip advisory/restrictions on the flight and it can be seen clear as day and this policy is not addressed there. You have to dig for it. I needed the mobile pass due to scheduling and not being able to get to the airport in enough time to wait in line to check in and then again to get through security and after speaking to 3 people, I was informed that there was nothing that any of them could do. So now, 18 hours before I even get to the airport, United has already wasted my time, messed up my schedule, misled me and tried to extort me into purchasing the checked bag (which I don't need), just so I can get the mobile boarding pass and adhere to my schedule. Don't let it happen to you. Such a scam.",-1
2017-12-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Auckland to Boston via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolutely terrible airline,True,"  Auckland to Boston via San Francisco. Absolutely terrible airline. On the way from Boston to Auckland, our first flight was delayed (for no apparent reason) causing us to miss our connecting flight in California. After significant asking, we were transferred to an American flight from LA to Auckland, because otherwise we would be stuck in California. Being aboard the American Airlines flight was actually such a luxury, the seats reclined and the TV's actually worked. Unfortunately we had to fly United back from Auckland to Boston. The seats were cramped, hardly reclined. Then flying back from SFO to Boston, the flight attendants were rude and we actually didn't even get pretzels. Only a glass of water for a 5 hour and 20 minute flight.",-1
2017-12-11,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Denver via Houston,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never traveling them again,True, Terrible company. I used to think it was one of the best companies to travel with. Never traveling with them again. Our flight got delayed in Miami and had a connecting flight to Denver from Houston obviously missed our flight in Houston. Company refused to pay for our hotel room and claimed it was not their fault. Not even offered a amenity bag with products. Traveled with lower cost airlines had a better treatment. Next day flew to Denver from Houston made me pay 50$ for a small personal bag. Are you kidding me?,-1
2017-12-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Houston via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,very bad service,True, San Jose to Houston via Denver. Very bad service with United. My fiancé and I had tickets together and selected seats on both flights but when we checked in they were changed twice and there were people in our seats with our same seat number on our ticket so we were forced to move.,-1
2017-12-06,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Columbus,2.0,,2.0,,1.0,2.0,2,extremely annoyed,True," Chicago to Columbus. Nearly missed the flight because they changed gates (to a completely different area of the airport) and only informed us through an indecipherable, static-y speaker. Extremely annoyed. Last time I flew with them, I missed my first flight on a round trip ticket because of a job interview. They cancelled my return flight with no refund and did not send an email or anything about it. It probably said that would happen in the fine print, but an email would have been nice.",-1
2017-12-06,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Newark,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2,aren't going to fly this airline again,True,"  Vienna to Newark via Zurich with United (Vienna to Zurich on Austrian, Zurich to Newark on United). We checked in two days before the flight and reserved seats, my one was 24K, so we do not sit split across the whole plane. When we arrived at the gate in Zurich, they gave us new Boarding cards with other seats across the whole plane. As we flew with our children, my wife and me would like to sit next to them. But United couldn't change the seats, so we had to accept it. Finally in the plane, most of the flight attendants were very rude, there was just one friendly FA on board. The food tasted horrible. It was the worst I've ever eaten in my whole life. Also the wifi didn't work. During the flight, the FA's were gone, we couldn't order something to drink and all the rubbish had to go into the seat pocket. Just before landing they handed out something like a Leach-Pizza piece. That also didn't taste good and it was full of fat. We aren't going to fly on this airline again.",-1
2017-12-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Orlando, FL to Philadelphia, PA",2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Never flying United again,True," Flew Orlando, FL to Philadelphia, PA. 10 and a half hours sitting in airports! Our first flight was delayed an hour and a half due to United’s fault, causing us to miss our connection. The next flight United could offer us was 9 hours later because they over booked all other flights. This is unacceptable! Basically, if you miss your flight due to United’s fault, you will be stuck sitting in the airport for many hours with a paltry $10 food voucher. Never flying United again.",-1
2017-12-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Savannah,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,how inconsiderate and rude,True,"  Newark to Savannah. Extremely disappointed in my recent experience with United. I was flying back home from EWR with my carry-on dog. I had all the necessary paperwork, carrier, and I had purchased the dog a ticket as instructed (note: this was my first time flying with my dog on a United flight, I usually fly JetBlue with her). When I go to board the woman scanning my ticket said she was changing my seat for me. I said ""thank you"" thinking that would be a nice gesture, but I was wrong. Once on board she came on the plane and told me that I was not allowed to sit in that seat (the one she changed me to) with a pet because it had no seat in front of it to stow the animal. I asked if I could move back to my original seat and she told me no. The flight attendants, as well as other people on the plane tried to talk her into letting me change my seat and she still refused, called a manager, and proceeded to kick me off of my flight. It was the most HORRIFIC experience in my entire life. She booked me on a later flight and forgot to transfer my dog over to that ticket, so when I boarded the later flight they were giving me a difficult time having the dog. This I do understand because they didn't have a record of it. However, once we got it all sorted out and everything was fine, they attendants refused to give me any water or take my trash. It was like I never existed on the flight! I am blown away by how inconsiderate and rude United was to me. From the ticket lady to the flight attendants on my later flight. It seems that across the board they value unprofessional behavior. I am originally from NJ so I do understand the somewhat lack of compassion inside the actual airport, but that isn't something that should transfer over to the airline or flight.",-1
2017-12-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jackson to Aspen via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never book a flight with United again,True,"  Jackson to Aspen via Houston. I will never book a flight with United again. First I called not once but three times to verify I could carry my wedding dress on and specifically how it would be packed and the measurements of the bag which did fall into their accepted guidelines. I checked in at Jackson, MS and could not carry my dress on, or they’d charge me $50. So I had to check the bag, which I was NEVER told about a baggage charge, two of us flying, 4 bags checked - $120.00!!! Then, I understood the small aircraft to Houston, but to Aspen? Seriously? I will say the staff on the second flight was very nice but the pretzels served, all 5 of them (yes sarcasm), the pretzels were smaller than my fingernail but what really made me disgusted was when they were picking up the trash, we noticed they stacked the plastic drinking cups, trust me they were cocktail size cups, later they came by offering water & I realized they simply rinsed the cups!",-1
2017-12-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to San Jose,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,second time I have a problem,True,"  Newark to San Jose. This is the second time I have a problem with United Airlines in the past couple of months. I purchased 3 last minute one way tickets to Costa Rica directly through the airline. When I checked out there was no notifications of having to purchase an onward ticket. When I got to airport I missed my flight because I was told I needed a round trip ticket to board and the only one they had available was over $800 I’d have to purchase 3 of them right away and I couldn’t afford it. When I let the United Airlines representative know I was a Costa Rican citizen she asked if my 12 year old and 2 year old “where Costa Rican citizens as well” when I told her no she continued to ask if “they had same father, because I’d need consent from them to leave the country” I thought that question was extremely rude and felt she asked me that only because of my ethnicity due to the fact she asked if I spoke English right from the start without me even speaking! Honestly made me cry from feeling so humiliated. United Airlines should worn people when buying one way tickets and most importantly should train staff to be more courteous specially in such vulnerable situations.",-1
2017-11-29,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Taipei to Las Vegas via San Francisco,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5,Above-average experience,True,"  Taipei to Las Vegas via San Francisco. Above-average experience on this airline. I originally selected this flight based on price, and was pleasantly surprised. All aircraft clean (including bathrooms) and flights on time. Good selection of entertainment. The only drawbacks were the crew was a bit hurried during the meal service on the international flights. Additionally, two different (senior) flight attendants were not sure what they were serving - one told me she didn't know what kind of noodles she was serving; another told my seatmate she had no idea what was in the omelette and handed her the ingredient list on the foil cover to read. Crew still managed to keep us fed and hydrated during the flight.",1
2017-11-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Santa Rosa via San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst airline I have flown,True," Portland to Santa Rosa via San Francisco. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. I will not use United Airlines ever again! I did not receive notice that my flights were being delayed. Santa Rosa was fogged in, told me I could take a shuttle or drive myself to San Francisco to make my connecting flight, but would not comp the shuttle ride, even though the other airlines were and no compensation for the fact that I was only using half of the flight I paid for. On my way back to Santa Rosa from Portland they delayed my flight by 3 hours, once again with no notice sent to me, and then made my lay over in San Fran 4.5 hours. When I asked for my luggage to take another shuttle since I only live an hour and a half away, they told me I would have to wait 2 hours to get it. They said I could pick it up in Santa Rosa since it would fly with or without me on the plane. I agreed and took the shuttle to Santa Rosa. When I got to the Santa Rosa airport, I went to United and asked about picking up my bag, they said that I could not pick it up after 6pm because they were closed but could deliver my bag to me instead, they took my address name and phone number as well as my bag number. I watched them (I could see and read the screen) pull up my bag info in their system and attach it to an email with all my information and directions on delivering my bag next day to my address between 6-8pm. 6-8pm comes and call the airline, get the run around about them saying that the person I spoke to never submitted a claim, and they have no record of the email that I watched him send being sent. Had to repeatly insist on speaking to a supervisor before being put through only to end up still without any idea of when or if I'll get my luggage back. In the end, I'm out 1 day of my vacation, $64.00 on shuttles that should have been connecting flights already paid for and my luggage.",-1

I just wanted to take the time to compliment United Airlines for the very excellent service my family and I received while we traveled to New Jersey for the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend. We flew out of Jackson/Hartsfield Atlanta airport very early in the morning on November 21 into Newark airport in New Jersey and flew home to Atlanta on November 25. Although we were prepared for and anticipated heavy traffic during those times, we were pleasantly surprised that everything went smoothly and we arrived at our destination a little earlier than expected. Both flights were smooth with just a little turbulence. The staff on both flights were friendly and on our return flight home we even received complimentary drinks and snacks which was a nice returning home luxury. We travel often due to having family on the west and east coasts and I will definitely look into picking United on future travel dates.",1

We flew with Spirit a few days before and they were much better.,-1
2017-11-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Hartford,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Get your act together United,True," I have never written a review about anything, however I have had a ridiculous amount of horrible experiences with United that have outraged me so much that now for the rest of my flying career I will avoid flying with them at all costs. I have never had issues with any other airline, it is clear that United has many problems and does not know how to deal with any of them. I have been on a flight that they overbooked by 40 people coming back from Switzerland. I have flown with them to Shanghai in the summer of 2017 and the flight was not only delayed by 13 hours but they also kept us on the plane for 8 of those hours without providing us any reasoning or even doing the simple act of giving us water. And today, my flight to Chicago was delayed so I missed my connecting flight to Hartford which I had to rebook and now that second flight is also delayed. Get your act together United, you seem to be the only airline that just can’t figure it out.",-1

I had flown from Cancun (United Airlines again) to LAX and had a 3 hour layover. All my bags were carry on, so were my companions. However, upon boarding our last flight to Seattle, we were told that our bags were not carry on size. I asked for the opportunity to put it the bag sizer. I knew it would fit because I was previously asked to do this. This United employee would not allow me to do that. She just dismissed me and my companion and said that we had to check it. Very rude and unprofessional. I am on the flight now and there are empty seats and overhead space available. I will not be flying United again and nor will my companions. Very disappointed.",-1

United Airlines is the worst airline I have traveled, allowing only 1 checked in baggage on an international flight. One of my checked in bag came with the zipper hooks & the TSA lock missing. When I called to report this, they directed me to contact the Charlotte Airport United Airlines Baggage Counter desk that was supposed to be open from 8 AM to 12 Midnight. There was nobody there & after waiting for over 15 minutes, I went to the United counter who paged the baggage guy. This person came to the counter & was extremely rude to me. He refused to compensate for the damages. I do not intend to travel United Airlines ever again.",-1

Absolutely the worst airline and customer service I've ever had. I fly at least 4 to 6 times a year, and I will never fly United ever again. I'd rather walk.

I booked reservations as a small group going to a women's conference November 8-12, 2017. Upon arrival to the counter we were informed that we would need to pay for our luggage. This would not have been an issue but I checked with an United airline agent on two separate contacts days prior to our departure. Our initial flight was accommodating as we had a handicapped person with us but upon arrival to Dulles our airport agent was very unfriendly and of no assistance to a ticketing issue. I additionally was dissatisfied with our airport agent at Greensboro who seemed to be unsympathetic and not bothered to our delay due to mechanical difficulties. There was no concern to whether we might miss our connecting flight to Pittsburgh. Overall I had a less than pleasant experience with United Airlines.",-1

When I checked in the desk said it was ok for me to have one small rollaway bag for the flight but when I got to the gate I had to pay $50 because the agent said it wasn't allowed. Flight itself was $126 and had to pay $50 dollars cause of their communication gap. Really not happy about it won't prefer United airlines when flying from now on.,-1

Why do they offer cheaper flights if they go out of their way to punish you. They make strenuous concerted efforts to make your life difficult. There were 12 window and aisle seats available and I asked for one. ""No. With your kind of ticket you get what you get."" Made us low life ""discount"" ticket purchasers wait while 30 people on stand by got called up individually, got their ticket, and boarded in front of us with their aisle and window seats. Absolutely pointless. They really go out of their way. If they want to exhibit vein-popping fury when you got a meager $20 discount for the basic economy ticket that was $500 then they should stop offering such services and just let themselves get beat out by better options.",-1

They don’t allow any free carry-on of any type anymore. I had a tiny carry-on bag with a pair of jeans and a shirt and they told me I had to check it with a charge of $50. The attendants are rude and there is no seat selection. My flight was over an hour late so my ride had to wait an extra hour. Everything was done wrong. I’ve never complained about a flight before but this is my first United Airlines and definitely my last.,-1

The most garbage airline. They don't have moral and ethics. They have issued me a ticket worth $2400 for 4 passengers (3 adults and 1 infant). Some kind of problem with the payment processing system. After 4 days they wanted to charge me $3870 for the same ticket. They don't want to honor their own system.,-1

We purchased our first class tickets on Aug. 4th 2017. We were given the option of selecting our seats so we did. (Seat 3A and 3B). We wanted to sit next to one another as most married couples do. Fast forward to today when we used the United Airline app to check in and download our boarding passes. Once we had gotten them and started to look them over guess what we found out? Our seats had been changed. When we called to verify we were told by someone not speaking very good English that since the plane was changed our seats had to be changed. I asked if this plane had seats 3A and 3B on it. We were told that indeed it did, but those were already occupied. We were then told that we agreed to ""any necessary changes in planes or seat assignments"" when we agreed to the ""terms and conditions"" of our ticket purchase. Since we don't have any way of changing airlines at such a late date we will have to live with not sitting in the same row as we had planned. This is the second time in as many first class flights that United has done this to us. I guess someone paid more money or had better connections then we did. Don't count on being treated like a paying customer by this airline. Once they have your money they don't care if you are happy flying the friendly skies or not.",-1

The flight wasn’t until 6 am and I couldn’t believe she wouldn’t let us in by 5:38 am. I will never use this airline again. I’ve never experienced such a thing.",-1

Took this flight for a Job interview in Houston and ended up not being able to make it to the interview unless I would have had $600 to purchase another plane ticket to leave later in the evening. I had called with in an hour of purchasing the tickets when I had realized the time was not going to work for me and was told there were not any other flights just that I would have to purchase a more expensive ticket to get what I would want. So I decided to try and make it work and one thing lead to another and I didn’t make it to the interview.  I would definitely recommend that United think more of there customers and not the bottom line but I am probably the one in a million that actually wrote a review that wrote a reply to your questionnaire. Good Luck and thank you but no thank you I will never fly United again.,-1

Delayed flying from New York to DC thus arrived 25 minutes late. Missed the connecting flight despite the plane still standing at the gate. Arrived at 9:30pm with a rescheduled flight. Instead of 3.30pm. United did not offer an apology. Don’t waste your time and money with an airline that has no standards.,-1

At least with a bus you can get off and walk or talk to the driver so you know what is going on. Shortly after booking our flight our layover was extended 4 hours with no option to reject this or get a refund. Now I am sitting her and layover continues to be extended with no communication. This is by far the worst airline. They used to set the standard and now their standards are nowhere to be found.,-1

2017-11-15,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Havana,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,What a terrible experience,False,"  Newark to Havana. What a terrible experience. I would expect at least a small meal for a 4 hr flight. None. On the way to Havana there was in-flight entertainment but you had to pay for this! I didn't know this was possible nowadays. Beyond this, the quality was so bad, it was definitely not worth it. I asked whether I could buy food and she asked what I wanted and left, my husband didn't even get a chance to order something himself. When the flight attendant came back with my food, my husband ordered something and I overheard one flying attendant saying to the other ""now the guy also wants something"" in a bad tone. Seriously? Also, there was no restriction on carry-on baggage size, so people had such oversized carry-ons that all the compartments were basically full before half of the people had entered the plane. On my way back the seats didn't even have screens! I felt like I was in the 90s. And there was no fresh food available, only snacks to purchase. One of the flight attendants was super unfriendly. What a bad experience. I didn't book the flight myself but if I ever get the chance, I would never book a flight with United Airlines. The only good thing about it is the nice terminal at EWR.",-1
2017-11-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Salt Lake City via Newark,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2,most cramped seating in memory,False,"  Perhaps the most uncomfortable flight in 40+ years of flying. Flight segment from Newark to SLC on a 737 offered the most cramped seating in memory. Legroom/seat pitch was the smallest I've experienced. When I asked the flight attendant if there was a better seat available, and if so what the upcharge might be, he offered to move me to a seat with a vacant center seat so that I could sit crossways with my legs under the middle seat. After an hour or so ""restless leg syndrome"" set in, a very unusual condition for me, and remained for the duration of the flight. I spent the last hour plus standing up. I should add that there were legroom seats available, but not offered. I strongly resent being required to pay $100 plus for such an upgrade, even if it had been offered. The seat pitch in economy is absolutely unacceptable for me. I also resent being required to pay for any video.",-1
2017-11-15,0.1,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Salt Lake City to Portland via Newark,3.0,,2.0,,1.0,1.0,1,avoid flying United Airlines again,False,"  Salt Lake City to Portland via Newark. After having received no email invitation to check in for this flight, I called the UAL phone number to check in. I notified the agent that I was extremely dissatisfied with the seat comfort (legroom) on my last flight and requested an upgrade. He offered an upgrade for $99 and refused to change my seat until I paid this. I paid it, but the process took over 20 minutes when he was unable to communicate well enough to take down my billing information (both the CC number and the address were taken incorrectly more than once). His English was only marginal. The process was extremely aggravating and I resent being required to pay extra for adequate legroom. If the airline had clearly communicated their available legroom on the original booking, I would have booked another airline with more. I will spare no effort to avoid flying United Airlines again. This experience makes a mockery of the concept of ""the Friendly Skies"".",-1

Now you not only have to pay for food but you also are provided with no entertainment in a 4-hour flight, unless you pay for Direct TV. The worst part is you are forced to pay with credit card if you want to see old movies such as The Lion King or Office Space. How can they rip you off that badly? They force to travel like sardines, they have no empty seats so checking in and out of flights involves standing in long lines to make sure that when you get on board your carry-on luggage will have space. They keep asking us for our cooperation because of a full flight. What do they do to make sure we have an enjoyable flight? We have to pay for food if we want it, pay for entertainment and suffer through the entire flight with the extra tiny space that they have given us in, for example, a Boeing 737. We, us customers, deserve a little better than this. Now you pay for checked bags, what are they going to charge us next? It needs to stop.",-1

Customer service is the worst, if you would like to prevent your bags from being destroyed, it's best to pack light and carry on the plane, or check in your bag at the airplane. I purchased a bran new bag before flying and United destroyed it. Im not someone that flies all the time, so I didn't know I needed to get this taken care of within 24 hours, flying for the first time in 10 years and flying to Chicago was scary and it was a business trip. So I decided to wait until I got back to Richmond as I figured my bag would just get destroyed more. Once in Richmond the lady in the baggage desk for United just wanted to argue with me that the quality of my bag wasnt good. Didn't even apologize that United destroyed my bag. And for that lack of empathy on her part, I will never fly United again.",-1

However it was clearly stated on United web that if you have United  explorer Credit card you can bring small suitcase Carry on to the plane free of charge. I was told during check in that ticket must be purchased with United explorer Credit card in order to bring carry on inside plane free of charge.

2017-11-07,0.8,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Tampa to San Jose via Houston,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3,a pleasant day of flying,False,"  Tampa to San Jose via Houston. Check in at TPA was quick and efficient. Boarding was timely and disciplined. Once we were all.seated and the main door was closed, the captain came on the PA to announce that there was a mechanical issue that would take at least an hour to fix. We all disembarked and general panic set in amongst those of us who were connecting in Houston. The experienced flyers amongst us understood that a one hour mechanical delay is usually the precursor to a cancelled flight, a missed connection, and an overnight stay in Houston. The harried gate agents began to reschedule connecting passengers. They had made some progress with the long line of nervous customers when at exactly one hour later, the head agent came on the PA to announce that a hydraulic leak had been repaired and that we were ready to reboard and depart for IAH. On both flights, I had the window seat in the forward over-wing emergency exit with the middle seat unoccupied. This is the seat I always reserve because the leg room is awesome and the passenger in front of you can't recline into your space. On the IAH-SJO flight I had the whole row to myself, which in some aspects is better than getting upgraded to 1st class. Pretzels and beverages were distributed efficiently on both flights, and more elaborate snacks and meals were available for purchase. The attendants were pleasant and courteous, the flights were smooth, and we arrived in San Jose safe, sound, and early. Despite the delay departing from Tampa, this turned out to be a pleasant day of flying.",1

Flight there was bearable but my flight back got cancelled on me (it may have been my fault) but the airport staff was terrible. They were basically saying well suck for you it’s not my problem. I ended up having to drive because of the absurd prices. Then the sad thing is that we went over to Delta and they were the nicest people ever and tried to help me. Later my brother left the same day to Fargo and his flight got so delayed that he missed his next flight. I ended up having to pick him up on my way just so he could get back without having to buy a whole other ticket. Will gladly say I will not fly United in a long time again.,-1

Bassinet not removed for landing, people with tray tables down, seats reclined and exit row persons had their screens still out. Would have been an absolute disaster in an emergency.

I went to ask questions about seating and didn’t even finished my question yet  “her respond was we have a full flight, single seating we have a full flight” and shook her head at the same time. Ok, I understand seating is full but does she need to be rude about it? Is this United Airlines value for customers service?

2017-10-27,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,couldn’t wait to get out of the plane,False,"  Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago. United used to be a good airline company. In the past, if you’d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, and you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, that’s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family. Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). I’m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, it’s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage I’ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply can’t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt they were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldn’t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc. I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called “developing countries” are better than United Airlines and treat their customers better than they do. As far as I’m concerned, From now on, I am going to make sure of one thing: to only put my feet on United Airlines planes if I have absolutely no other choice.",-1

Worst airline I have ever flown in the world. Their ground staff, phone customer service, email response everything is pathetic. Frequent delays, poor service is unparalleled.

Unfortunately, United is the most convenient option to travel to SJO, nonetheless, I will try to avoid flying with this airline from now on.

First, our flight was cancelled and they texted us with an alternative flight leaving a day later, with a 9 hour layover! I'm, excuse me? Since this was a weekend trip we would have had to turn around and get back on a flight back to SF a few hours later. I called and they didn't even offer the option to refund the ticket! I finally got us on an alternative flight leaving earlier after waiting for 30 minutes to speak with a supervisor because the person I initially spoke with had no power to do anything to help. We ended up flying Alaska Airlines on the way there and I wish we had originally booked through them because the way back was awful. They wouldn't seat my partner and I together because we were flying Economy class, which they reminded us of repeatedly when I complained. The agents claimed they had no power to do anything because of the computer system which randomly selects your seats. I asked what about people traveling with small children and they didn't seem to have an answer. As if we got a better deal than with any other airline out there after all the bag fees. Oh yeah, that's another thing. The Economy class/the majority of the people flying have no carryon allowance. By the way, when we got on the flight we were able to sit next to each other because the seats next to us weren't even occupied. Ridiculous. Never flying United again. I've been bumped off of flights and had bad experiences before but this was the last straw for me.",-1

First time flying with United. First class left much to be desired. Typically when we have flown in First, we are offered a beverage while waiting for passengers to board and during taxi.

2017-10-16,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Denver,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,humiliated and disrespected,False," My last trip on United Airlines left me feeling angry, tricked, humiliated and disrespected. The new Basic Economy fair offered by United appears to be a marketing trick to make their lowest fair seem competitive with other airlines' basic fares. They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one's boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one's allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment that they cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter's personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child's size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before getting to the airport. One is forced to print one's boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process with having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, but I was able to get the bag into the box. I was very tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter's very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. The suitcase fit with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. The kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn't even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to get another attendant to finish printing them. The attendants are there for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever. Despise United.",-1

If you fly basic economy, you can’t do standby, no options, they do not state this on their website either. My flight was delayed 2 hours, no explanation and no sympathy from their terrible company.

Never have I experienced such delays for no apparent reason other than the flight was late to begin with - they boarded us two hrs late, as soon as the prior flight de boarded. Bathrooms filthy, no beverage service, other than warm water. After boarding they notified us that we would be sitting in the plane for another two hours. Not a full flight so we found some seats to stretch out in, as soon as I got comfortable in my new seat I was informed that I had to relocate to my original cell of torture - again, for no apparent reason. The attendant begrudgingly gave me warm water as if! Suffice it to say, I will avoid flying this airline at all costs.",-1

United Airlines delayed the flight due to some maintenance issue and when we asked them to transfer our reservation for the next flight or book us with some other airline they said nothing is available for the time we wanted but when we personally checked for available flights we saw it was available. When we asked them to do it they showed inability and we could not fly with other airlines too bacause this airline wasted the time and we missed our international flight and we lost $860 for it's cancellation and more $3540 amount for new tickets also. It's like we are paying for United Airlines mistake. We were going after 2 years to our country and they simply said sorry for whatever happened.,-1
2017-10-12,0.3,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Orange County,4.0,,2.0,,,4.0,1,get nothing in return,False," Total scam! I purchased a basic economy which does not include luggage, but was told if I get a United Airlines credit card, I would get the first bag free. The United Airlines credit card has $95 annual fee, which is high, but if I get priority seating and 1 free bag, it will be worth it. When I check in, none of what they told me is true. Not only that, I could not check in my very small backpack on wheels because basic economy does not allow any carry on that fits in the overhead bin. No matter how much money I was willing to pay extra to keep my very small bag, smaller than airline regulation size bag with me, it was not an option and I had to pay $25 for the first checked bag and $35 for the second checked bag. The sales people push you to get their credit card with $95 annual fee and you get nothing in return - no priority seating and no carry on bag when you purchase basic economy ticket.",-1
2017-10-12,0.2,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Orlando,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,"unwelcoming, and inconvenient airline",False,"  Flew San Francisco to Orlando. Two words, never again. I fly very often and I will no longer fly United. As I arrived to the gate the women checking the tickets let me know by her body language that I would not enjoy my flight. She appeared as though she hated her job, was irritated, and completely unwelcoming. Never looked up to take my ticket or anything. Once I scanned my ticket I was told I had to check my bag, there were still about 40 people waiting to board the plane. When asked why I received attitude of ""it just does, there is no room on the plane."" As I get on the plane I notice empty overhead bins everywhere and as I am walking down I see that a majority of the bags are small personal items. Purses, small backpacks, plastic bags. So basically I had to check my bag because United fails to enforce policy and as well prematurely calls the aircraft ""full"". The whole point of me traveling light is so that I do not have to check my bag as this is one of the biggest headaches about traveling. I'll tell you I have never had this issue on competing airlines. Judging by the reviews of 3/10 I'd say that is accurate. Moving forward I would rather pay more than have to deal with this unfriendly, unwelcoming, and inconvenient airline.",-1

The seats were so small, besides the nasty disgusting food and tight seats, the flight was on time and smooth. I travel this route four times a years and finally got a chance to complain",1
2017-10-11,0.2,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Tokyo Narita,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,I instantly regret it,False,"  San Francisco to Tokyo Narita. SFO lounge closed at international terminal, food was terrible, bag was lost and delivered only a day later despite a direct flight. Terrible service. Every time I use United Airlines I instantly regret it. The ground staff wasn't helpful nor friendly in SFO",-1
2017-10-11,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to San Francisco,2.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,not be flying them again,False,"  Las Vegas to San Francisco. I purchased a last minute flight home to Las Vegas to spend time with family. Because it was so last minute, I was looking for cheap tickets and United had the best deal. I booked a 5:50 AM flight back to San Francisco in order to land and get to work. Having flowing in and out of McCarran International Airport quite frequently on early morning flights, I knew that I should be able to move through things fairly quickly. I arrived at the airport at 5:05 AM. I went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and was stopped. United Airlines employees told me that I was too late to get on my 5:50 AM flight, and that I would have to wait in the ticketing line to rebook my flight. I kept trying to explain to them that at I still had over forty-five minutes until my flight left and that I wasn't checking any baggage, but they wouldn't listen to me. Instead, they forced me to stand in a ticketing line for 20 minutes by which point it really was too late for me to make the flight. When I got to the counter the woman rebooking me acted as though I was checking my back. When I explained that I wasn't, she got what can only be described as an ""oh no"" look on her face. Then, she very apologetically explained to me that a mistake had been made, and that I should have been permitted to pass through and get on the flight. Apparently, despite having tried to explain the exact same thing multiple times to the other employees they chose to stop me anyway. I had missed the cut off for passengers trying to check luggage (45 mins) but not for people just trying to print their boarding pass and go straight through to the flight (30 mins). What made it even more frustrating was that I arrived in the terminal at the gate for my first flight before it had even taken off. At that point, I should have been offered some sort of compensation for the wasted time, but United didn't give me anything. I filed an official complaint on the website, but unfortunately I don't have any proof of what actually happened, and so I don't expect that it will be resolved in my favor. I definitely will not be flying them again if I can avoid it.",-1
2017-10-11,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Rapids to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3,definitely do not recommend,False,"  Grand Rapids to Newark. Worst customer service ever. I will not use United Airlines again.They have nothing good to offer besides a cheap flight. My luggage was destroyed and they said they were not responsible. The ac unit on the entire plane was out, nothing was offered. And on another flight my chair was broken and wouldn't stay in one position. Super uncomfortable ride. I definitely do not recommend.",-1
2017-10-11,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Washington via New York,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,nothing negative to mention,False,"  As someone who attaches a lot of value to reviews that I find online about companies, I feel compelled to share my positive experience with United Airlines. After having read a lot of the previous reviews I expected the worst, but I found a half price multi-city ticket for direct flights from Amsterdam-New York and Washington-Amsterdam with United Airlines, so decided the trip would be worth the money no matter what happened on the flight. In the end there's nothing negative I can think of to mention about my experience with United Airlines. Both flights were on time, the food was great (butternut squash pasta for example) the staff on the plane was very friendly and customer service was helpful and easy to reach. There were enough interesting movies/series on the flight to make the 8 hour flight go by really fast.",1
2017-10-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Taipei to Las Vegas via San Francisco,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,1,condescending and patronizing,False," The flight from Taipei to Las Vegas via San Francisco was very good! Better than expected. However, dealing with United Airlines customer services is another story. We wanted to cancel our return leg of Las Vegas to San Francisco as the transfer time is too tight and did not want to miss our international flight San Francisco to Taipei. I called customer services and at first they were quite polite on the phone until they told me I had to pay a cancelation fee of US$100. So, I said OK, what if we do not cancel the flight, but just don’t board the plane? They responded by saying I would still have to pay US$100. I asked why? UA will be able to resell the seats and I am not asking for a refund. Then she started being condescending and patronizing. I was outraged by their logic and treatment. How can they call themselves customer services? They did not service this customer!",-1
2017-10-09,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Charlotte to Munich,,,,,,1.0,1,Will never fly them again,False,"  Charlotte to Munich. I purchased a premium economy ticket through United (a Lufthansa operated flight) for approx 3000.00, get a receipt for economy, I call and they said it will be changed. Cannot check in until day of flight or pick my seat. They tell me at checkin that that is the price for economy! That is twice as much as their partner Lufthansa and 600 more than premium economy. Total rip off bait and switch, worse service. All about the money with no concern for customers. They are in the news all the time for a reason and that is because they don't have credibility. Will never fly them again!",-1
2017-10-08,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hartford to San Diego via Washington,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,thankful to the great agents,False,"  Hartford to San Diego via Washington. We missed our original flight by 2 minutes. The agent on the gate got us on another flight immediately. When we got to our layover destination, we went to the customer service desk and the agent there put us on an earlier flight than originally planned. We only got to our destination 2 hours later than originally planned. I'm very thankful to the great agents who helped us out.",1
2017-10-07,0.1,Business,First Class,Louisville to Tulsa via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Absolutely the worst!,False,  Louisville to Tulsa via Chicago. The only reason they got any stars is because no stars wasn’t an option. Absolutely the worst! I picked up my checked bag at the baggage claim. Halfway out to my car I checked to see why it was pulling funny to find that the baggage handlers had somehow managed to break the frame of duffle bag. When I got home I called to make a claim only to be told that there was no way for them to correct the issue unless I drive an hour and a half back to the airport. Southwest might treat you like cattle but at least they’ve resolved every issue I’ve ever had.,-1
2017-10-06,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Des Moines to Orlando via Chicago,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,now we are absolutely disgusted,False,"  Des Moines to Orlando via Chicago. Basic Economy ticket, though my pregnant wife and I did not realize the restrictions now in place. We usually fly Delta, but booked these tickets later than usual and Delta flights from DSM were limited. I cannot believe any company would think it's is a good idea to force families or groups to not sit together. Even if there is extra room on the aircraft, they will not allow you to change seats. Tried online, tried when checking on at front desk, tried prior to boarding at the gate. These tickets were not basement bargains by any means. We were disappointed with United two years ago (last time we flew them), now we are absolutely disgusted. I don't care if you hold off on assigning seats until at the gate, for your ""cheapest tickets"". But if there are empty seats in the economy cabin, let families, groups, kids, parents, and couples, have the opportunity to sit next to eachother. Really, it does not matter, for you will never have our business again. And we will be strongly encouraging others to follow suit. We tried your services again expecting sub par service, and honestly were even more disappointed. Please stay away from this airline. Worst on the business, does care about it's customers. I feel sorry for the people working on this sinking ship.",-1
2017-10-03,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Washington,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3,unacceptable response by FA,False,"  Ottawa to Washington. FA serving drinks put a full glass of juice on my six-year old son's tray. It immediately slid off onto his lap. She tossed napkins at us and got some paper towels from the FA working in the small first class cabin. The man behind my son seemed to have got some juice on his pants which passed through the back of my son's seat. The FA apologized up and down to him, advising him on how he could get some compensation and telling him how sorry she was. I was sitting there with a soaking wet six-year old. I told the FA that she put the drink down and it slid right off the tray. She proceeded to give me a lecture about how there's an indented part of the tray specifically for glasses and that when an airplane is ascending, it is on an angle - talking to me - a seasoned 1K or Global Services flier with United - as if I'm the six-year old. I found the purser and told him about the rudeness of his flying partner. He apologized profusely and said he'd speak with her. Completely unacceptable response by the FA working in the economy cabin.",-1
2017-10-02,0.7,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Newark,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,4.0,4,I was pleasantly surprised,False,"  San Francisco to Newark in Business class. Despite many negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised by United. Firstly the fact that I was able to change my flight time at no cost (Star Gold) on day of departure was a huge help. Boarding at San Francisco was organised and orderly. The plane itself was old and the cabin pretty gloomy, but for a decent price I got a flat bed, comfortable seat large range of entertainment options, decent food and drinks, and an ahead of time arrival. Arrival in Newark was a breeze although priority luggage wasn't first off. I had very low expectations, but would fly United again.",1
2017-10-01,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cincinnati to Chicago,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,1,outrageous and unacceptable,False,"  Cincinnati to Chicago. I booked the economy fare for a quick trip. I read the rules and saw that I could not bring a full size carryon bag; everything would have to fit under the seat. This was fine, I would not be able to carryon or handle checked luggage anyway because of recent shoulder surgery. I shipped my things via UPS to my destination. I had no problems from CVG to ORD other than the plane being delayed an hour – no big deal. The problem was when I got to ORD for the return trip. When I got to the airport they would not give me a boarding pass to get through security because I had a small purse and a 13"" laptop case. They interpreted the rule as only 1 carryon which was my purse. I brought both of them from CVG to ORD with no problem but in ORD I could not take the laptop. My purse was considered my 1 bag. I talked to 2 people and they both refused me. I tried to get them to let me take it to the gate for their checking but was refused that also. I could not check the laptop in the hold because it was a flimsy case that would not take the beating of the conveyor belt and it had a lithium battery. I had to leave my laptop with a friend to express ship to me at a great cost. I found this whole incident outrageous and unacceptable. You should not let people get through half of their trip and then enforce some policy and you should make this clear when buying the ticket that a purse is considered your carryon.",-1
2017-10-01,1.0,Business,Business Class,Dublin to Newark,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,go via Dublin wherever I can,False,"  When flying to the States I go via Dublin wherever I can as the Security clearance in Dublin is a bit of a no brainer and after months of deciding how to get there this time decided to try United Polaris, it was around £400 cheaper than the alternatives. Security was quick using the Fast Track, and we were soon in the new Fifty First and Green lounge where there was an array of breakfast pastries to enjoy before boarding.  We’d chosen row 8 and boarding was painless and we were soon enjoying a pre take off Mimosa, having stowed the Saks of Fifth Avenue bedding. Menus were handed out and crew came and took orders for mains before take off. The seat was spacious and comfortable. This was a brunch flight and crew came out with a trolley to make signature Bloody Marys and Mimosas which were served with warm nuts. Meal service with a delicious smoked salmon starter was followed by a succulent steak with scrambled eggs and potatoes. After the cheese plate a United sundae was served, drinks were regularly topped up by crew who were absolutely outstanding, and friendly. Great inflight entertainment and a nice range of snacks were available and about an hour before landing lunch was served which was roast chicken with cous cous and veg. Flight landed on time at 1110 and thats where the benefit of Dublin security kicked in - we were out of the airport with checked luggage and in our taxi at 1130. A great way to get to the States which I’d happily recommend.",1
2017-09-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chattanooga to Hamburg via Chicago,3.0,,4.0,,,2.0,1,United Airlines is an absolute mess,False,"  United Airlines is an absolute mess. I was supposed to make an international flight from Chattanooga to Hamburg with two layovers in Newark, NJ and Copenhagen. Well the United flight from Chattanooga to Newark was cancelled due to “air traffic problems”. There was never any notification of the cancellation and everyone had to find out at check in. Since I was supposed to be making an international flight, they quickly rebooked me to fly to Chicago, then Frankfurt, then Hamburg. The flight from Chattanooga to Chicago was decent. I had a 4 hour layover in Chicago waiting to board my international flight to Frankfurt. As I was boarding the employees pulled me aside and told me my boarding pass wasn’t valid. They said I was booked going to Stockholm in the computer system. So they didn’t let me board the plane until they could figure out what’s going on. Then the plane closed the door and took off without me because they couldn’t sort out my ticket situation. So whoever rebooked my ticket, did something completely wrong - gave me a boarding pass that wasn’t actually valid, and I missed an overnight international flight. Since the error was 110% due to United’s employees lacking the simple skills to print a valid ticket, I was at least given a hotel room for the night. Unbelievable that this would happen.",-1
2017-09-28,0.8,Solo Leisure,First Class,San Francisco to Las Vegas,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,Service was efficient,False,"  Flew San Francisco to Las Vegas. The on time performance on this flight impress me. From boarding to the landing gate it was early. Service was efficient, just beverage and snacks, since it was late evening. Flight attendant comes regularly to check up on the passengers, although still missed taking away my glass before take off. The seats comes with PTV, but are showing their age on this ex Continental 739, still was a comfortable ride. Luggage arrive at the carrousel before I did. I see improvement on this flight.",1
2017-09-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Dayton,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I'd rather fly with Spirit Airlines,False,"  Flew Chicago to Dayton. I wanted to see the quality of United as we always fly American. Let's say I'd rather fly with Spirit Airlines. I will never book another flight with them. First we taxi out to the runway and wait for 15 minutes, then we turn back and go to the terminal and 3 people get off the plane. Let me tell you there was no communication at all to us. And we are now 45 min past departure time. We were supposed to be landing by the time we took off. Absolutely terrible.",-1
2017-09-25,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Chicago,1.0,,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,would never recommend this airline to anyone,False,"  We got on the tarmac to leave from Philadelphia, right as we were about to take off the captain announced that there was a maintenance problem. 20 monutes later: captain announces the maintenance crew still hasn't arrived. 1+ hours later: finally leaves Philadelphia. Thankfully, we didn't have a connecting flight but I feel bad for the dozens of other people who did. I was already unsure about flying with United in the first place after hearing about other friends experiences. Now I understand where they are coming from. I don't care if it's typically a little cheaper compared to other airlines - I would never recommend this airline to anyone. Not worth it.",-1
2017-09-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rochester to Newark,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,2,$25 to check in their bag,False,"  Rochester to Newark. I understand things happen, flights are delayed for safety purposes, I get it. But do not tell your customers they can't bring the standard purse and smaller carry on until they get to the airport and you trick them into paying $25 to check in their bag. I only realized this while in line using their terrible app trying to check in and avoid the line. Extremely poor user experience. This should be made clear to customers and shouldnt even be their new policy because there is plenty of room under a passengers seats and in the overhead bin. This almost caused me to miss my flight, i just made it. Once you leave a bad first impression like that, doesnt matter if your crew is friendly and services you well. You have now given me a negative perception of your airline and i will gladly pay more to fly with jetblue and american where i have had great experiences. You really expanding those profit margins per the few extra passengers getting tricked into paying $25 to check a bag?",-1
2017-09-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Atlanta,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,never recommend to anyone,False,  Los Angeles to Atlanta. Never using united again! My flight was extremely delayed. There wan no flights to get me and my family to our destination the same day. We're on a layover until the next day extremely unacceptable. There was no refund given So we had to still take the flight or lose all the money I paid on tickets for my family one infant and 2 toddlers waiting days for a flight at the airport is unacceptable. I hate United and will never recommend to anyone.,-1
2017-09-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Cedar Rapids via Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,Why does this airline exist,False,"  Why does this airline exist? Worst experience, seats were filthy. The seat pockets had dirt in it, and service is usually bad.  I went up to the customer help desk in Chicago to ask if I could jump on an earlier flight from Chicago to Cedar Rapids (I had a layover in Chicago). They told me the flight is full. When I mentioned there are tickets available on their website, I was told I can book it online then. While boarding the flight from Toronto, my carry-on bag was taken without my permission and checked-in. I am really speechless with the horrific experience. I am going to avoid United in future. Will pay few dollars extra for a better service.",-1
2017-09-22,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Orlando,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,worse than low cost airlines,False,"  Worst service ever! I booked Chicago to Orlando economy ticket without knowing how bad and awful it was all the restrictions and the way they ask for them it's rude and disappointing. I realize that United Airlines is worse than low cost airlines, and this is the last time I book a flight with United",-1
2017-09-22,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Charleston via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,3.0,1,I feel taken advantage of,False,"  Boston to Charleston via Newark. Being charged an additional $25/way to carry on a bag on a United flight is a terrible way to get extra revenue for a company. On our connecting flight to Charleston thru Newark from Boston, and the airplane was half full with plenty of space to store additional bags in the overhead compartments. I feel taken advantage of and this will be the last time I ever fly United.",-1
2017-09-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Los Angeles,,,,,,,1,No apologies offered,False,"  Well, let me start off by saying that I never made the trip with United Airlines since my flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles was cancelled the night before (roughly around 15 hour before departure time). I simply got a one-line message saying that my flight was cancelled due to aircraft maintenance. No apologies offered. I called the customer service to confirm this and ""uh huh"" was the only answer I got. Again, no apologies made. The customer rep's attitude was extremely indifferent and just plain rude. Never, will I fly with this airline before. If you're thinking of flying long-haul flights with them, I advise you to think twice!",-1
2017-09-22,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Milwaukee,2.0,,3.0,,2.0,1.0,2,luggage never made the flight,False,"  I had a direct flight from Denver to Milwaukee. My flight was fine, however my luggage never made the flight. How is that possible on a direct flight? I was told that they were sorry and my luggage would be on the next flight (which was later in the day), but would personally be delivered to me by the next morning (Tuesday). That was 1:30 in the afternoon on Monday and it is now Wednesday, late afternoon. I keep getting the ""run around"" giving me different answers every time I speak to someone. Luggage is still in Denver, now it's in Milwaukee, on its way to Chicago, on its way to Green Bay, back in Milwaukee, etc?) Extremely Frustrated.",-1
2017-09-21,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Portland to Austin,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Dissatisfied and angry,False,  Portland to Austin . This trip was by far my worst experience flying and I fly pretty frequently for work. This trip started off by being diverted from Houston directly to Austin and having to sit 1.5 on the tarmac in a hot cabin. From there my luggage was lost and I had to have it shipped to my hotel missing my evening meeting I had arranged. On the way back I could not confirm my flight and I had to lose my original seating assignment flying into San Francisco. Now I'm in the SFO airport and I have been waiting since 430 for my flight but after three delays and three gate changes I am worried I will not even get home today. I haved use other airlines and never have this many screw ups. Dissatisfied and angry. Avoid booking with United at all costs.,-1
2017-09-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moline to Salt Lake City via Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,I will no longer book with them,False,"  Moline to Salt Lake City via Denver. I had a very unpleasant experience with United Airlines on September 18, 2017. I was told that because I was two minutes late, my seat was reassigned. It was unclear that I had to be at the gate 30 minutes prior to my departure and if I were late my seat would be reassigned. On my confirmation email, it clearly states that my seat will be automatically assigned prior to boarding and can't be changed once they're assigned. Thus, I had to take the next flight at 5AM. When I was on my flight the next morning, I asked the flight attendant if I could move two rows back because the plane was not to capacity and it would be more comfortable for both myself and the gentleman next to me. I was told by the flight attendant that, ""They had already made a count and that the weight distribution would be off"". Having flown previously, I've moved seats before with no issue. Because of these experiences, I don't feel that United Airlines values their passengers and therefore, I will no longer book with them.",-1
2017-09-20,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Rochester,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,4,wanted to congratulate United,False,"  Washington to Rochester. The flight was very pleasant except for the rather disturbingly rude person who sat next to me. He was quite rude to the stewardess. I believe he was upset because it was a short flight and couldn't give him the amount of alcohol that he had hopped for. He fussed and decided to write very awful things about her. Dispite this the stewardess was very patient, calm, and kind. I find this very admirable, and just wanted to congratulate United on hiring such a resilient woman.",1
2017-09-19,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Denver,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,treats their basic economy class as lower individuals,False,"  United has quickly become my least favorite airline. Upon my 2 day travel to Phoenix, I arrive to the airport with my purse and my backpack. I'm unable to carry on my backpack because ""that's just the fare that I purchased."" After asking when they implemented this new rule, the women replied, ""don't argue with me ma'am."" I was simply asking a question. As a woman, I should be able to carry a purse and a backpack onto a plane. Now, after careful planning, on my way home I now have to check my small 8 pound backpack and will be late for work in order to wait for it at my destination. These ""new rules"" were never clearly stated when I purchased my ticket. I also purchased 2 tickets under one credit card and they put my husband and I on opposite sides of the plane. United treats their basic economy class as lower individuals and I will never travel with them again.",-1
2017-09-19,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Ft Lauderdale via Dulles,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,"worst service, worst flight",False," Worst service, worst flight, ran late and landed after our second flight was departing and no one tried to assist us!

I would highly advise any airline is better than United if you want reliable helpful crew.",-1

I cannot remember the last time I flew United. For this trip, United had the best tickets for the price. The planes were planes, the snacks were the same. I was truly shocked at how good the crew were on all four legs of the trip. I was traveling with my three year old son and they could not have been more accommodating. He was so sick on our way to Oregon that we were running back to the bathroom every 45 minutes. They were kind and generous and offered to help me during this very stressful flight. On the way back home my son was feeling better and we did not need as much help or support. Although, we received it anyway. Both crews offered help, extra drinks or snacks through out the flights, as well as offering to help me off the plane. I cannot remember the last time I had such a positive experience on any airline. Great job United!",1
2017-09-18,0.1,Business,Business Class,Boston to Shanghai via Chicago,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,like a third world airline,False,"  Boston to Shanghai via Chicago. It has been years since I flew United and I forgot how bad it is. They totally milk their ORD frequent flyers. Departure lounge is spare with no food or alcohol. The business class seat configuration is 8 seats across, barely wider than coach and less place for a bag than coach. Both flights took too more than an hour late with no explanation or apology. Flight attendants bark orders. Wi-Fi broken with no explanation or apology. Meal choice - forget it, only one left unless you're 100K in which case they will literally take the meal of another passenger for you. AC power outlet broken, so no charging for 15 hours. This is like a third world airline. For a $5,000 ticket this is shameful and a good reminder that not all seats are equal.",-1
2017-09-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Orlando,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,flight that gives you cramps ,False,  Newark to Orlando. Friendly skies more like lies in disguise.  If you want to be nickle and dimed for an average flight that gives you cramps and where the people generally do not care about you or your business then United is the flight for you. You will be charged for every step along the way and don't expect staff to be friendly or helpful. In a market where other airlines go out of their way to ensure your comfort and to provide the best value for your travel I'm shocked that United still chooses to act the way it does.,-1

2017-09-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Mexico City,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,The unfriendly skies,False,  Newark to Mexico City. The unfriendly skies. Flew with my 3 and 5 year old boys. They were not able to seat us together despite I asked when checking in and on the plane. The plane was not full. This is the first time an airline place my kids away from me. One kids fell sleep and the other came up to me on my middle seat. The guy next to me tried to help and moved one row forward to the emergency row so my boy could be next to me. Immediately a sour purser came and threw him back as the emergency row is a premium seat on United. I understand their policy but do think the purser could have helped. Lounge food is very low quality compared to Lufthansa or BA. We are gold and silver level on SA which seems to be only reason to fly United so you can board early and bring more luggage,-1
2017-09-10,1.0,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to San Francisco,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,grateful to United Airlines,False,"  I purchased non-refundable round-trip tickets from Boston to San Francisco for my husband and myself to attend my dear cousin's funeral. A day before our scheduled departure, I canceled my husband's flight because he had a bad cold and was coughing too much to get on a plane. In my conversation with United, I was told how to file for a refund (even though my tickets were non-refundable). I traveled to San Francisco myself. The direct flight both ways went fine, but the return flight was remarkable. By chance, I ended up sitting next to my sister and brother-in-law who were returning to Boston from the same funeral. We chatted with one of the flight attendants who knew we were returning from a funeral. She was exceptionally kind and gave us complimentary snacks. Her kindness was greatly appreciated during our bereavement. After I returned home, I filled out the online Refund form to see about getting a refund for my husband's ticket. I explained that not only was he coughing too much to get on a plane for six hours but it would have been very inconsiderate to other passengers for him to be hacking away. United Airlines was kind enough to promptly issue a refund for my husband's unused round-trip fare - a full refund, not a credit for future travel. I appreciate the refund - the thought of having to pay for an unused round-trip ticket for a funeral would only add insult to injury. I am grateful to United Airlines for making a very unpleasant situation (me traveling across the country alone, without my husband, for my cousin's funeral) as comfortable and pleasant as they could.",1
2017-09-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,disappointed with the quality of service,False," I travel frequently and United consistently lacks in quality compared to American, Southwest and Frontier. The customer service here needs serious improvement, for example today I asked a flight attendant if there was any room left in overhead compartments for my carry on (even though this is still 7 minutes or so until boarding ends and all of the compartments had been closed early) very kindly and politely and the response was completely rude and dismissive to my question she told me ""that can comfortably fit under your seat, in the most condescending offensive tone"" well I am a 5'10"" woman whose knees already touch the seat in front of me and would like to be able to enjoy my flight. She acted like it was too much to ask and so I then had to be uncomfortable unnecessarily on a flight that I paid for. So instead of arguing about it, as it was not worth my time and energy I then said forget it and then just bitterly deal with it the rest of the flight. I am very disappointed with the quality of this service, it's a Friday afternoon and the last thing anyone wants is to start their weekend feeling annoyed.",-1
2017-09-07,0.4,Business,Business Class,San Francisco to Boston,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,2,seems to use inaccurate scales,False,"  My daughter and I were flying business class from San Francisco to Boston on United night flight. We both had 2 bags weighing of which one was weighing 67lbs and the other ones 70lbs. Upon check in, someone who acted like the manager in charge helps us get the baggage tags from a machine and then put our bags on the scale. He told us they were overweight and that we had to pay for the extra lbs. We did not agree because we had weighed the bags before and they were good to go. An argument started and the man became very rude to us. Then we took the bags and put them on another counter scale and the weights were exactly like the ones we had measured ourselves before going to the airport. Then my daughter started taking pictures of the scales and suddenly another employee came to us and said ""don't worry it's ok you can go""! Apparently, the company seems to use inaccurate scales to get some extra money from voyagers. This is unacceptable and I am filing a complaint with the company. My advice is that you weigh your bags before going to the airport and once there ask to double check on different scales.",-1
2017-09-07,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Hong Kong,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3,FA's ruin the experience,False,"  Newark to Hong Kong. I only fly United because they dominate the Newark airport, which happens to be the closest to my home. To be fair though, and to set aside all my prior experiences I will review the flight from a fresh slate. The aircraft, a 17 year old 777 with the old Continental interior. There was personal in seat IFE but it was slow and unresponsive. The movies that were available were recent and best sellers. I was very happy to see that the drink cart was busted out maybe 4 times during the flight and about every hour there was an FA distributing water. Flight was only about 20 minutes. Food itself was a choice between western and asian meal. To be honest, none of the meals were good. But what kills me the most about United is the horrible customer service, flight attendants are all rude and cold. No matter how decent the actual flight may be, the FA's ruin the experience.",-1
2017-09-07,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to San Francisco,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,Staff were rude and unhelpful,False,"  Atlanta to San Francisco. Staff were rude and unhelpful. It amazes me how you can wait for an hour to rebook a flight only to have the gate attendant look at the line and say ""we have other flights to deal with, if you were on the moved / delayed flight, take it somewhere else. We're not dealing with any more of you."" Made it to the next gate and had to convince that attendant just to check and see if I'd make a 10pm connection. Her answer was ""no"" and she seemed to think her job was complete. Waiting on hold and in lines for hours just to be told I won't make it home. No effort whatsoever to actually rebook or solve the problem. Of course no compensation or hotel was offered after finally rebooking for the next morning after being on hold with United for almost an hour. Pay hundreds of dollars for a service, and they truly seem to have no to minimum interest in actually delivering that service to you.",-1
2017-09-06,0.4,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Boston via Chicago,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1.0,3,join them in this boycott,False,"  Austin to Boston via Chicago. I booked these flights for me and my daughter to take her to college, so we had 4 checked bags between us, a carry on and personal bag. The flights were fine, left on time, and arrived early. No surprises with our seats, or food (we brought our own). On the way home, I even got to upgrade my seats, not all the way to first class, but at least closer to the front. The staff were all pleasant, so no complaints. However, a day after our arrival at our destination, my daughter called and asked if I had some of her underwear. I said no, they must have been left at home. She said no, that she remembered packing them. However, I wanted to wait until I got home to make sure that we hadn't just left them. When I got home 2 days later and they weren't there, I called United. I was told very rudely that because I hadn't called within 24 hours of the flight, I couldn't make a claim. I told him that I wasn't interested in monetary reparation, I just wanted to make the complaint to let them know that they had a pervert baggage handler somewhere. He was still rude and said that they couldn't do anything because I didn't call within 24 hours of the flight's arrival. Really?? No shock and horror at one of their employees stealing?  United blew it at the last moment. No wonder so many people refuse to fly United, including 3 of my family members who fly all the time for work. Now I will join them in this boycott.",-1
2017-09-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Chicago,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,airline does not respect customers,False,"  Flew Washington to Chicago. This airline does not respect customers. My Washington inbound flight was delayed on Sep, 1st and now, Sep, 4th I am sitting for 3 hours in the boarding room waiting for guess what, another United delayed flight. Remark: Both cases caused by aircraft maintenance. Ground staff answer to questions about food was the best: ""Oh, Sure, we can provide water and some snacks""! The pictures show the snacks and the quantity, it was a great exercise to get one for my wife and another for myself. Hoping for better regulations to make this business more serious. Thanks, United.",-1
2017-09-04,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Chicago,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2,inflight entertainment would not work,False,"  London Heathrow to Chicago. I booked through Travelup and thought I was on an Air Brussels flight and I discover it was United Airlines one. At check in I was impressed by all the help while taken aback to be asked the address I was staying. I unfortunately gave them an old address out of my address book which I then had to somehow correct, the staff reassured me with address labels. The staff on the plane seemed older. I started to be unimpressed when I found myself sitting in a seat that had a yellow sticker on its arm indicating that the inflight entertainment would not work from that seat. The staff alerted technical support who confirmed this so I and other passengers were given the opportunity to sit in any other spare seat. What unimpressed me was the staff could not get the inflight entertainment to work for any of us, we were given the option of buying into their wifi service (about $25) which out of principle I was not going to do, especially when the staff commented it was a bit intermittent anyway and there was no way of recharging my ipad as there is no USB port at the seat. I asked if they had any magazines, no. As compensation we were, at the end of the journey, alerted to their online 'appreciation' service. This I duly filled in, however their site did not allo me to put in my uk county for my address so i had to lie to make the page move forward and say IL for Illinois where I am staying. Promptly I had an offer of $100 offered me towards another United Airlines flight to be used within a year, which is not something I will use.",-1
2017-09-04,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Indianapolis via Chicago,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United never again,False,"  Orlando to Indianapolis via Chicago. After sitting for 30 min on plane at the gate we were notified of a hydraulic leak seen by nose gear. We sat at gate on plane for almost an hour before finally being cleared. Our connecting flight was to leave Chicago at 12:15, there were about 8-10 of us just on this flight due to be on same connecting flight. We arrived and ran as fast as possible to get to the gate and got there at 12:06 and gate was already closed. Their delay in first place caused us to be late and yet they couldn't wait a few min for us to get there. Plane was still at gate, luggage still being loaded etc. so in a nutshell their plane leaving an hour late wasn't an issue but waiting 6-8 minutes for 8-10 passengers to arrive due to their issue late by 6 min wasn't good enough. United never again.",-1
2017-09-02,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to San Francisco,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1,the worst experience ever,False,"  Orlando to San Francisco. My trip with United was the worst experience ever. They have this new rule with no carry ons. We bought the tickets from expedia and we had no forewarning. At the check in kiosk we found out about this new rule. We checked in our carry on much to our annoyance about not receiving any previous warnings. At the gate my husband had his suit in a hanger and a backpack on him and the employees were rude and obnoxious before we even got a chance to talk. The employee immediately started baddegering us about receiving 17 alerts about no the more than one item per person rule. When we tried to explain we bought the ticket from expedia and didnt receive any warning, she went on to imply that we were lying! Another employee had to intervene and let us through (as if they were giving us a pass) This is ridiculous! Make an announcement if you are changing policies! When we entered the airplane was hot while we were being seated. No air! Till we took off for 40 minutes. This experience is the worst I have ever had and my family or I will never fly United ever again.",-1
2017-09-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Honolulu via San Francisco,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,entertainment simply buffered,False,"  Vancouver to Honolulu via San Francisco. Two flights each way to Hawaii, and on all 4 flights the film entertainment simply buffered beyond belief after 30 minutes and the wifi failed completely eventually. I would have been even more annoyed if I'd paid $9.99 to borrow a screen. On the last leg of the flight home, we persevered with a film and it took us 3 and a half hours to get through it! The staff were polite but knew nothing: one even told us that ""oh yes, the network doesn't work well over water"".",-1
2017-08-31,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Seattle,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,terrible customer service,False,"  Chicago to Seattle. Flight was delayed for 45 minutes, making us miss our next flight. We have to wait four extra hours and don't even get to have seats together in the next flight. Unites Airlines terrible customer service strikes again! What a great start to our honeymoon.",-1
2017-08-31,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,delayed 45 mins with no explanation,False,"  A 45 min flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco was delayed 45 mins with no explanation, no water, nothing. Seat comfort was noticeably worse than anything I've flown domestically, and felt much more cramped than the Delta SFO-LAX I fly regularly. I'm 5'10 and my knees were painfully pushed the entire way without front person reclining. Its time for the FAA to step in and force airlines to have some humane minimum seat dimensions. Hope to never fly united again.",-1
2017-08-31,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Lisbon,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,3,fulfilled the minimum requirements,False,"  Lisbon to Washington return, and I did not see any major glitches with the service. Meal was tasty, a decent choice of entertainment, and staff was helpful. It wasn't stellar service but it fulfilled the minimum requirements. More importantly, on the way back we had to change planes when we were already seated because there was an electrical problem and United managed to prepare a replacement aircraft in just over 2 hours, which I found impressive. I don't think flying through the US is the best option to fly to Canada, but I would probably fly United again to Canada via Dulles if I could not find an affordable flight that is direct.",1
2017-08-31,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Newark,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,will never fly United again,False,"  Chicago O'Hare to Newark with my 3 year old daughter, 5 year old niece, and 11 year old nephew along with my mom and sister. Was told and shown that we all had seats together. This is very important considering we are flying with young children. We receive our boarding passes and see that all of us are separated. Uhm no. The lady at the gate was incredibly rude and seemed as if we were a bother, pretty sure it's her job to help customers. She told us ""it's ok, you are all near one another anyways so it's not a big deal."" Not a big deal? Excuse me! We board the plane, my 3 year old daughter who has never flown before has a seat between two adult males. I question one stewardess about this, she tells me, ""oh it's fine she can sit there and you are back here and you'll be able to see her."" Well I don't know about you but I'm pretty sure I can't see through the bathrooms and around the corner! I then not so nicely told her that she must be losing her mind if she thinks I'm going to let my 3 year old daughter sit on an airplane for 2.5 hours in between two strangers and out of my eyesight. Her response, ""ma'am, you need to sit down in your assigned seats."" and walked away. Attempting to control the anger that was bubbling up from my insides I found another stewardess who was able to help me and have people change seats so I could sit by my daughter. My sister had the same encounter with the same stewardess about her children. Absolutely ridiculous! What airline thinks it's ok to place a small child alone between two strangers on an airplane? The employees at the concourse were rude and unhelpful. We had checked in online to save some time, not sure why because when we arrived we had to check in again at the kiosk. We were then told we were all TSA pre checked and to proceed to that area.  Except, we weren't. Only 2 of us were and those 2 were the 3 and 5 year old. Because that makes sense doesn't it? Let's send a 3 and 5 year old through security alone. So then after finding this out we then had to walk all the way back down to the ""regular"" security. Flight after all of this was uneventful. On our trip home we were delayed over 7 hours due to weather in Chicago. I can't hold United accountable for this as I am a smart and rational person and realize they have 0 control over the weather. We were all given $15 vouchers to get food and drink while we waited for our flight. Which was great, except the vouchers didn't work. For any of us on that flight. The computer system wouldn't recognize the voucher and would lock up. So we were not able to get those over priced $12 chicken strips.  I was unimpressed with this airline. Horrible customer service. Horrible employees. Horrible experience. We will never fly United again. Ever.",-1
2017-08-31,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Lexington,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,treats customers very poorly,False,"  Chicago to Lexington. I fly on an occasional basis; usually about 6-8 times a year. The last few tripsI have used United Airlines due to finding the cheapest ticket available. It wasn't worth it. Once on the plane, things are okay. You get the usual economy service for the price; a cramped seat, and service of beverage and a small snack. Getting onto their planes is an issue. Out of the last 4 planes I've been on with United, 2 of flights had gotten cancelled, including my most recent flight from two days ago. One of those four was a 3 hour delay with bright, sunny skies. Apparently there was a mechanical issue. So one out of four flights I had actually been able to board on time as scheduled. Not a good record! For both cancelled flights (the one two days ago, and one in January 2017) they refused to assist with paying hotel fees, even when it was an ""air traffic problem"". They also provide very little notice of cancellation. I was at the gate both times about 20 minutes from boarding, late at night. So I have to scramble to find another another flight and a hotel when its very late. Their lines are long and slow to get through. Calling them is hardly better as there seems to not be an option to wait on hold. Two nights ago I called, then was promptly informed by the automated system that the lines were too busy and to try again later before being disconnected. Not even a callback option! Just ""call back later"" before it hung up. I had to pull strings with a family member who is a travel agent to assist me in getting a flight while everyone else waited for hours. I realize some of this waiting cannot be avoided, but its simply ridiculous. Overall, this airline treats its customers very poorly. It was a very bad joke when I went by a sign claiming United had the most on time flights.",-1
2017-08-30,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Boise to St Louis,1.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,I am finished with United,False,"  Flew United twice in past 2 years and both trips were at least 2,000 miles and both were non discounted fares - for 2 passengers. I paid for premium economy because I am tall, long legs and the airlines keep adding rows now and again to squeeze more cattle aboard. You see, I am discriminated against because I am tall. I cannot shorten my legs so I am forced to purchase premium seating now. Each of these 2 flights required connections, the connecting flights were cancelled so we had to spend 7 hours and 8 hours - respectively - sitting in connecting city airports. Since the flights were canceled for mechanical or flight crew issues, there was nothing to be done. I waited in line at customer service but United Customer Service told me I was in the wrong place to file a complaint! So I complained online and I was sent a measly $100 voucher - which I won't be using, since I will never fly United again. I was United premier several times and Delta Million Miler and have flown extensively for the past 35 years. I will fly other airlines or drive but I am finished with United.",-1

We were treated very poorly from the beginning. From the moment we checked in on 18 August at 7am we were told our plane had mechanical issues but go ahead and check in. Every few hours we were told that it wouldn't be long. After half the day at the airport we were told to book another flight. Lines after lines at the United podium we were told that it would not be much longer, couldn't get another flight. After 10 hours of waiting at the airport we finally got notice that our original plane was about to approach. Then we found out that they had switched my ticket to another plane than my husbands. We booked out first class tickets together with seats next to each other. After more long lines we finally got them to put on the same flight but they did not put us sitting together. We were supposed to be in Bozeman, Mt at 1pm but finally after all of United's fiasco we arrived at 11pm and missing one of our bags that was checked. It arrived 4pm the next day. Everyone associated with this airline is a joke!",-1

I called in to try to change it to a new flight at a different airport or on a different day. The system told me ""press 1 to receive a call back or stay on the line to wait."" I didn't press any buttons and I planned to wait, but their automated system said ""great, we'll give you a call back"" and the call was ended. So I waited 50 minutes and never got a call. I am trying to call again now. This time it didn't give me the option of a call back. It just said it'll be over 30 minutes and hold music began playing. I have now been on hold for an hour and 34 minutes. I'm still waiting for someone to answer this phone and have no idea how much longer it'll take. I cannot stand when companies don't have enough staff at their overseas call centers. I flew once with United in July (that was my first time ever flying with them) and my flight got cancelled then too. I've flown American, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta and have never had a flight cancelled in my life. Flew twice with United (once in July, once in August) and both times they've been cancelled. And it's impossible to get anyone on the phone. Safe to say I will be avoiding United for the rest of my life. Two absolutely terrible experiences.",-1

",False,"  Flew Birmingham to Los Angeles. Disappointing and lying customer service. While in the middle of a wedding ceremony, I was notified by text that our flight has been cancelled. I waited 1 hour 45 min on customer service (after pre-recording said it would be 30 min) to have our seats changed so we could sit together. We received our boarding passes minutes later only to learn the seats had not changed. Do not tell me that something has been taken care of in order to get me off the phone and make your job ""easier"". I would have respected the truth much more than this lack of integrity. It's a shame that this was my last impression of United. They re-routed me out of Houston during the hurricane and did a great job with that call. I will avoid United in the future as it is apparent that they continue digging their own grave and are often times deserving of their poor reputation.",-1

However, this morning, I received an email saying that I received a refund for the flight, which I never requested. I requested to have a different flight cancelled, but I have yet to receive confirmation of this. Upon calling United, we were told that there was nothing they could do about the flight they wrongfully cancelled, that he could not get onto the flight. No answer wasn't provided as to why I received a refund or how it was even requested. The representative could not answer any of our questions. However, the flight is still available, but for $110! We are truly baffled by and disgusted by this experience with United Airlines. Neither of us will be flying with United again.",-1
2017-08-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Washington to Denver,,,,,,,1,incompetent rude staff,False,"  Washington to Denver. I called to try to resolve an issue with my name change and my miles and was transferred to four different people over the course of 45 minutes before it was then only partially resolved. The first person literally couldn't even understand the simple issue I was raising. On the fourth person who was a supervisor, I asked to check on my seat assignment and was told I had to be transferred to yet another person. I waited 30 minutes to talk to that person, with no option for a call back like the other airlines offer, only to be told that they could not change my seat to an aisle or a middle seat without a $160 fee. Almost half of the economy seats were economy plus, so even though they were available, they could not be assigned to ticketed passengers. I fly 15-20 times per year, mostly on American, Southwest and Delta. I have had pleasant experiences with all of these airlines. Never have I dealt with an airline with such incompetent rude staff only to have that conversation end with an explanation of a bad policy that I should have been able to get from the first - or even the 5th - person I talked to. This will be the second time flying United this year. I will never choose United again.",-1

I got delayed and stuck in Oahu coming to and going back home to San Diego. Venturing to Oahu, both connecting flights were delayed and I missed my plane going to Lanai. And was stuck in Oahu. But at least I had my luggage. But was not offered a hotel or anything. However, the venture back home, they wouldn't let me onto the flight despite having a seat and confirmation number. Since I bought through expedia they were having issues giving me a paper ticket. I missed my flight and was stuck on Oahu with only my backpack and the clothes on my back. My suitcase made it home before I did. I didnt get a voucher or any accommodation. And Missed a day of work. Dont fly on united even if it is cheap. Fly Hawaiian if you travel to Hawaii.

We previously reserved our seats for a family of five going on vacation; however united kicked us out of our seats that were all together in row 20 (or maybe 21 I can't remember exactly) to all in different rows in middle seats. I was bumped to the very last row. The man next to my mom was bumped up to first class so she asked if her husband could move up to sit next to her (as he was originally going to according to her reserved, confirmed ticket) and the stewardess said no because that seat costs extra money. Keep in mind he was originally supposed to have a better seat than that had United not messed everything up. We weren't alerted of our seat change until boarding the plane. Absolutely no respect for this airline. Will never fly them again. Also no free wifi or TV.",-1
2017-08-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Charleston, SC to Cody, WY",3.0,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,1,Our travel experience was awful,False,"  Me and 2 friends were flying to Yellowstone for a vacation. First of all, there shouldn't be a 35 minute layover in the Houston airport as an option. My bag had to be courtesy checked in Charleston, so when I landed in Houston, I had to wait 10 minutes for my bag. We ended up having 10 minutes until the gate closed for our next flight. We ran (I kid you not) 0.7 miles across the airport from gate B to E. When we got to the gate (we made it 2 minutes after the gate closed), they said they could only let 1 of us on. When I asked why, the lady hesitated and said they couldn't let anyone in the gate after it closed. But she let one of us on, so that made no sense. Found out they gave our other 2 seats away. Wouldn't they know we had a connecting flight that was tight on a layover time? Well, we went to customer service and she says ""You had 8 minutes to get to your gate. Did you get lost?"" Are you kidding me? She wouldn't comp us a hotel or anything. Said they weren't liable. She couldn't get us on any flights until the following day at 11pm. Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn't they do this on the way there? The next morning, our flight from Houston to Charleston was delayed an hour. I have never in my life experienced so many flight issues as I did for this trip. Our travel experience was awful, and if United would at least compensate for some of that ridiculous amount of extra money we spent, I would be way happier right now.

No wonder United is getting such a bad reputation. I booked my flight months ago so I could be in Knoxville during the eclipse. My flight leaving Seattle was delayed causing me to miss my connection in Houston. I was originally supposed to arrive in Knoxville at 10:34 am. Now I'm not going to get there until closer to 5:00pm causing me to miss the eclipse. I was told United couldn't book me on another flight because I had a economy ticket. I paid over $500 for my ticket. I will never fly United again. Not one apology!,-1
2017-08-21,0.5,Business,Premium Economy,Tokyo to Washington DC,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,3.0,2,it was a poor to average experience,False,"  It was my first time to fly with United from Tokyo to Washington DC and after the bad press they've been receiving, I was a little nervous. Overall, it was a poor to average experience. On the ground (US side) their staff can definitely be better trained. I'm a vegetarian so I requested a special meal - probably the worst airplane food I've ever had. Don't bother requesting the vegetarian meal and just risk the regular food service where they usually have a meatless pasta/noodle option. The seats in premium economy have a good amount of legroom and the entertainment on board isn't bad either. I think my biggest issue with the experience overall was the disinterest of the flight attendants. After being repeatedly hit by the cart going by and the patronizing tone the FAs used when giving me the veggie meal, it makes you wonder how they continue to use their 'friendly skies' pitch. One of the flight attendants was really helpful though he was helping from the first class cabin.",-1
2017-08-20,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Medford to Newark,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst travel experience,False," Absolutely the worst travel experience I have ever had both ways with United. 14 people were not able to board the plane, it sat there for at least a half hour while we all tried to convince the staff to let us on, but our connecting flight was delayed so they could load three people long after the departure time. Our return flight the flight attendants were very rude and skipped over multiple people when handing out snacks and drinks, our final connecting flight home was delayed 45 minutes because they were waiting for a flight attendant to arrive. How is any of this good business practices. The absolute worst!",-1
2017-08-19,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Will not fly United again,False,"  Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. Took my kids for their first plane trip. Wanted them to have a good view, seating chart (Embraer 175) showed our selected seats in front of wing (row 11). Got on plane and guess what, over the wing! Needless to say they strained their necks the whole flight trying to see things out the window. The seats are very uncomfortable, hard as plastic, comparable to a city bus. I've flow other airlines, and never expected the level of discomfort I found in this plane. Will not fly United again.",-1
2017-08-19,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to London via Washington,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,good value for your money,False,"  Orlando to Heathrow via Washington. The only problems that I encountered was severe weather which delayed are flight by 40 mins but they turned the plane around very quickly. Even after the delay I still didn't miss my connection, the second thing was the food on my flight back to London, it wasn't the best but then it wasn't horrible. On both flights the ground staff were helpful and informative, also on both flight the seats were cushioned and had a lot of hip room. The cabin crew on both flights were funny, helpful and informative. The inflight entertainment has a ton of stuff. The wifi was easy to access and has good connectivity. The food and beverages are good but personally I think pasta and mushrooms aren't the best mix. Overall very good value for your money.",1
2017-08-18,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Syracuse via Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,Extremely rude staff,False,"  Phoenix to Syracuse via Newark. I purchased my ticket a month before my departure date. I got to the airport and everything was fine. I paid for my carry on bags and got on the plane. We ended up having to land the plane in Atlanta because of weather. The staff told us we should only have a few hours layover and be back up in the air. A few hours passed by and we were told to board the plane. We all got on and sat for 30 minutes then we're told to get back off because there was no pilot. That itself annoyed me because it's a waste of time. We were told we had to stay in Atlanta. They gave me my carry on bag because everything I needed was in it and since I was going to be stuck in the airport over night I wanted to brush my teeth and use deodorant and have my phone charger to charge my phone. After the staff gave me my carry on bags. I was told I'd have to pay the baggage fee again. This delay and overnight stay in the airport is not my problem and I didn't feel like I should have to pay for my bag again. Ridiculous. I told the staff is there anyway they could accommodate for unexpected food and bag fee to wave it and maybe give me a voucher for food. I was told by all the staff that because I was a solo traveler, that they would not make any exceptions for me and told me they have more important things to deal with. I explained to them that my bank had locked my card because I tried to use it in the airport so I had no money and it was to late to contact my bank. The only cash I had on me had to go towards this carry on bag fee. The staff told me they could not help me and I needed to go find a spot to relax until the next plane had a seat for me. I am extremely upset with the carry on bag fees, the staff were very rude not only to me but everyone. I am upset that we had to sleep in the airport over night with no food or drinks offered to us. No blankets and they charged me another carry on bag fee because I needed my bag due to being stuck in the airport. I will never fly with United Airlines again. Extremely rude staff have no sympathy for people at all.",-1
2017-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Burbank via San Francisco,,,,,,,1,nothing but terrible,False,  Chicago to Burbank via San Francisco booked for November 2017. The customer service I have received through this company has been nothing but terrible.  While on the phone with them they were very rude and couldn't give me any alternate options or help. They only told me to contact costumer service via email. They didn't provide me with an email address and I couldn't find one on the site so I had to use an outside source to find the email. When I contacted via email it took them two weeks to write back to me and another week to reply to my response just to tell me that they couldn't help me at all. This is highly inappropriate. If you wish to run a business then make sure your agents are trained to solve all problems and trained to actually respond to costumers in a timely manner. I also want to add that the website never works and is beyond difficult to navigate. I am beyond upset with the service I was given and I plan to never fly United again.,-1
2017-08-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,La Guardia to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Will not fly United again,False,"  We had a flight from Washington to LAX, aircraft had problems, they asked us to deboard. Little by little a 20 minutes delay turned in to a 5 hours. End of 5 hours they send passengers scrambling. Today again, on my flight from New York La Guardia to Washington, aircraft was disabled. A 15 minutes delay turned to hours of delay while waiting for parts to fix the flight. Sending passengers scrambling again. United staff were so un accommodating and mean, made me feel like it was my fault the flight got issues. Horrible experience. Will not fly United again!",-1
2017-08-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Santa Rosa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,told the flight got cancelled,False,"  San Francisco to Santa Rosa. The flight got delayed due to awaiting aircraft. Fine. After hours of waiting, we finally get onto the flight, sat for another hour on the plane and were told the flight got cancelled. Got back to the airport customer service and it is 9:00 PM (another hour wasted in the waiting line for so called ""compensation"") and asking for the next flight to get to Santa Rosa, got the boarding pass then got told you have to get your own hotel room. Now I am still in San Francisco, paying out of my own pocket for a hotel room simply because and I quote ""United policy says if (the delay or cancellation) it is due to weather, there is nothing we can do"" Even though, there is no rain no fog or whatever in San Francisco area at all, and Santa Rosa is right next to it! Come on UA you can do way better than this! When you cancel the flight you should think about consequences instead of throwing your customer out of the flight like trash.",-1
2017-08-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Redmond,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,1.0,1,general disdain for passengers,False," United is terrible. Boycott them for their plane delays, terrible front desk service, and general disdain for passengers. Sat and sitting in the SFO Terminal 3 waiting for 4 hours while they constantly switched our gates around and changed the departing times probably 12-15 times. Absolutely horrendous. They need a huge change up. Will gladly pay more to fly other airlines in the future.",-1
2017-08-13,0.2,Business,Premium Economy,Toronto to South Bend via Cleveland and Chicago,4.0,,4.0,,,1.0,4,no information as to where the bag was,False,"  Having not chosen to fry the friendly skies with the unfriendly United Airlines I now remember why. Had booked a flight to South Bend Indiana from Toronto via Chicago. Received a text indicating my outbound flight from Toronto was being delayed. The text did not mention I would miss my connection. Luckily I figured this out myself. Not that difficult. Called to re-book and the utterly useless staff members only suggestion was to spend the night in Chicago or leave the next day. I was able to find an alternate route. Toronto/Cleveland/Chicago/South Bend. There was availability on an Air Canada outbound to Chicago but she would not consider this. As time was becoming of the essence and I did not want to miss the possible flight, no time to argue. As it turned out the text message I received was wrong and I would have been able to make my connection. How do I know this? When my Cleveland to Chicago route was delayed I had plenty of time to check Fligthtracker. When I showed this to the agent in Cleveland he said the United Text system is often wrong and in future I should call. Really? Well the good news is I made all my connections. The bad news no bag. The very helpful agent in South Bend advised he had located my bag in Chicago and it would out in the first flight in the morning. He may have been very helpful but not truthful. Woke up this morning. The text message from United said still looking for the bag as did the website. Called the lost baggage number provided, their lost baggage centre is located in India so there were obvious communication difficulties. Not her fault but took about 20 minutes for her to tell me that though the bag was last scanned in Chicago there was no information as to where the bag was.",-1
2017-08-13,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Tampa,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,most pathetic excuse of an airline,False,"  I purchased a ticket from the United Airlines counter at George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Friday afternoon, August 11 2017. I purchased this ticket from a United Airlines ticketing agent. I was assigned seat 21C on flight 1789 leaving at 7.25pm. I was at the gate 2 hours before the flight departed. We boarded the flight, sat in my assigned seat 21C and settled in for the flight home. Suddenly a gate agent boarded the flight and asked me to gather my belongings and exit the flight, this happened without any explanation, I was embarrassed in front of many passengers and told to deplane the aircraft. I was brought to customer services were they finally provided some poor answer that their agent mistakenly did not finish the ticket purchase and that I would not be allowed on their flight. Very rudely their customer service personal basically said we will do you a favor and not charge the $50 rebooking fee, here is a ticket for tomorrow. I requested my bag and they told me it had left with the airplane that I didn't have a ticket for. The most pathetic excuse of an airline I have ever experienced.",-1
2017-08-13,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Melbourne,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,2.0,3,staff are horrendous,False," Overall, United Airlines economy service is ok from Los Angeles to Melbourne, seats comfortable enough, food ok, entertainment good but the staff are horrendous. They are loud, bossy, burnt out and just plain rude. They seem only to be able to manage the absolute minimum of words necessary to convey the intended message, for example, ""Eggs or French toast?"" Yelled at you in military style, then when somebody dared to ask a question, the staff member replied ""Just Choose,"" then continued with, ""that wasn't so hard now, was it?"" Clearly they have forgotten that it is their chosen profession to provide a service and that the general expectation from that service is that it requires a certain amount professionalism, diplomacy, helpfulness and even some basic pleasantries wouldn't go astray. It's really not very nice having your food practically thrown at you. The passenger on the window seat of my row had her sandwich tossed in such a manner that it fell on the floor and she had to scramble around under her seat in the dark to retrieve it, disgusting! I would suggest retraining or maybe a pay rise for inspiration!",-1
2017-08-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santa Ana to Newark,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,The service was terrible,False,"  United has to be the worst airline I have ever flown on. Flew Santa Ana to Newark. It was more than an hour late going to my destination. Coming home, first it was delayed, then delayed again, then the flight was canceled. A true nightmare. I had paid extra money so that my minor son could sit with me. Because they had to put us on another flight, there were no seats together. Would they refund the extra $50.00 that I paid. No way. The service was terrible. I highly recommend choosing another airline.",-1
2017-08-10,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Little Rock to Kalamazoo via Chicago,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,4,attendants were beyond kind,False, Little Rock to Kalamazoo via Chicago with United. This was my first flight with my 4 month old and I was very nervous. The flight attendants were beyond kind and accommodating. We were lucky to be on two flights that were not full and the crew so kindly gave us a spare seat which made our trip significantly less stressful.,1
2017-08-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Reno via Denver,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,will never fly them again,False,  Detroit to Reno via Denver. United Airlines was the most unorganized airline I have ever flown on. They didn't provide good customer service on or off the ground. We arrived well over 3 hours for a domestic flight and no one kept us informed if we would make the flight or not due to the computer problems they were having and could not print tickets. This is understandable but to pick people who were yelling and causing the most commotion as opposed to calming veryone down letting all passengers know that the flight crew is aware of the problem and no one would be missing their flight. When i would try and ask questions i was dismissed without answers and they were rude.  Leaving the trip had a horrible experience with them as well. Again we allowed ourselves plenty of time especially after our first encounter with them. We again waited in line for hours when we finally approached the desk They only let 2 of us check our bags. The other 2 family members they refused to allow them on and had them fly out later that night. I have never encountered such an uncompassionate and unorginized company. I will never fly them again even if the flight is free.,-1
2017-08-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Salt Lake City via Houston,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,"rerouted, delayed and put on stand by",False," 3 out of 4 of our United flights from Dallas to Salt Lake City via Houston return were delayed and one ultimately cancelled due to 'operational/staffing' issues. We were told for two of the flights that the Captian 'didn't show up'. We were rerouted, delayed and put on stand by. We ended up with an extra 10 hours of time spent waiting. In the end, we rented a car and drove 7 hours from the airport just to get home so we could make it to work.",-1
2017-08-08,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Toronto via Chicago,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4,They were the cheapest,False,"  Tokyo to Toronto via Chicago.  The food was good for the long flight from Tokyo. Standard. My complaint is that I was not given a choice due to being in economy class as they ran out of the other choice. I guess that's what I get for being poor.  The flights were mainly on time, but they were delayed a bit due to things that were out of control. Otherwise, it was reasonable. Customer service was standard and expected. The staff was efficient and friendly enough and were able to answer my questions. They lost my luggage and I was disappointed. But I was able to get my luggage back delivered the next day and the help desk was nice and friendly. Standard amenities, the blankets were thin and did not keep me warm, no extras but for the price, I did not expect any extras. They were the cheapest airline.  Overall it was a good experience, standard and I'm happy I got my bag back so quickly.",1
2017-08-07,0.5,Business,Business Class,Newark to Berlin,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,2,Polaris not a good business class,False,"  Newark to Berlin. I was excited to be on one of the first Polaris flights but turned out to be a total disappointment. First of all, United serves Champagne in plastic glasses -  Plastic? The food was not great and the cabin layout neither. All in all not a good business class. The wines though were good.",-1
2017-08-07,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Bay City,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,1,squeezed into small planes,False,  Flew Chicago to Bay City. This is worse than terrible. United does not offer First on these flights. You are squeezed into small planes. The bored stewardess walkes down the plane once to check that the belts are on. I sat next to the lavatory. It was smelling. The door did not shut well either. I found this experience really horrible.,-1
2017-08-06,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Houston to Amsterdam,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I will never fly United again,False,  Houston to Amsterdam. We spent 8 hours at the airport while they tried to get the plane going - it was clear while we onboard the engines didn't turn over properly and no air conditioning was working . Finally they said we would get another plane and we had a new gate. Around 10pm they suddenly cancelled this flight. We were on the next day departure and they took our plane to give to another route and then we had to wait now for another 3 hours while this farce continues. United - this is disgusting. Enough is enough and I will never fly United again.,-1
2017-08-06,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Newark,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,very dissatisfied experience,False,"  Atlanta to Newark. I am a mileage plus member and I paid my ticket through my card in order to avoid the check in fee. When I approached the customer service at airport, they made me pay for the bag as their system has incorrect expiration date of my mileage plus card. Very disappointing. After I reached my destination, it seems my bags never left Atlanta and they said I would get my bags by next day afternoon. After 24 hours they has still not located where my bag was. We were in the same clothes for two days. And since this was a holiday for a short time we ended up spending most of our time indoor rather than touring NYC worrying about our bag since we had everything in the checkin bag. I have had another very dissatisfied experience with united. Strongly recommend against flying united.",-1
2017-08-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,attitude is careless and useless,False,"  Denver to Tampa. The passengers were boarded two times - one on a defective plane, second with pilots who expired their flight time. The flight was supposed to take off at 5:45 and it is 9:39 and now we are again at the gate waiting for a fresh crew. The flight attendants did not bother to provide us with water even if we stayed in the plane for over an hour. I had to ask for water. I had an injury at a leg and a flight attendant made fun of me instead of providing assistance. The overall attitude of United personnel is careless and useless.",-1

We have to extend our trip for 2 more nights - One in san diego and one in Chicago. No hotel or food compensation. They give us hotel rebate, not able to have room for four. Have to sleep on the floor at the Hilton Rosemont Chicago. Worst company, no customer services Dont ever flight with",-1
2017-08-05,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to San Francisco,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,1.0,2,A huge disappointment,False,"  Frankfurt to San Francisco on August 2, 2017. My flight was scheduled to depart from Frankfurt at 13:55 and we boarded the plane. After 2.5 hours on the plane with a faulty filling of fuel above tank level, the plane system shut down, upon restarting the engines a small fire started and they called the fire trucks to put it off. No maintenance was able to get the flight at such short notice while risking the lives of 550 passengers. We were shuttled back to the airport to spend the night at hotels. This is when the mess started - The instructions from service counter was not through a microphone; messages were mixed up and confusion about who is to go out and who is to stay in and what followed this chaos was really bad. We were told that we will be met by hotel representatives and will get meal coupons. I followed the United Airlines rep. And at passport control I was asked to go back to C terminal (after walking and riding trains to get to it, i found out it was Z and not C that I had to go back to). Some needed a visa to go out to the outside hotels and some didn't. After Finding my way back to Z terminal where United Airlines were supposed to be; nobody was there. Asked Lufthansa service desk and they said we have nothing to do with it. I waited for 7 hours to board this flight then ran around in circles for 3 kilometers and security checks and trains without food and water all day I lost it. I asked Lufthansa to help and find out where do I go for the night. They eventually told me to go to Z22. The United Airlines rep gave me directions to the hotel inside the airport and gave me meal coupons. Stating that the flight is tomorrow at 10am. I checked out of the hotel by 6:30am and waited for further instructions of Service counters which opens by 8am. There was no flight at 10am. They booked some passengers on the 13:55 flight and told us that our flight is now at 17:00. The UA flight 2720 left at 18:00 from Frankfurt. By the way, the UA planes are not equipped with screens and you are required at short notice to download their application to your smartphone and watch movies! Do you expect international travelers to be connected with internet to download applications on the plane to get to the entertainment of your flights? My iPhone was not able to connect and open any movie, barely a slow connection stopping every minute when you access a trailer version of the movie. A huge disappointment that I will never repeat.",-1
2017-08-05,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hartford via Newark,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,will not fly again,False,"  Washington to Hartford via Newark. Absolutely awful expirwnce. Flew back from DC at 6 am. Was required to get my carry on bag checked, and pay the money. Then the staff in the plane was very rude. Arrived at my stop in New Jersey. Confusing airport, but made it to my gate. They said the flight was on time, but we were not going to board yet. I went up and asked the guy st the desk if he knew the boarding time. He literally said ""sit down, I'll make the announcement when I do"". Got on the plane after a uninformed hour delay. Didn't take off for another hour, of just sitting on the plane. Rude staff on their cell phones. Finally get off and it takes me a hour to get my checked bag. Left feeling so stressed and a travel home at usual takes me a hour, took me 5 hours. Would not recommend, and will not fly again.",-1

Another departure, yet again starting with a delay. I intend to post to this site every time I fly United. The comments will not only be made when I have a negative experience, which I hope is the case, but here we are again with a 90 minute flight home. More time spent dealing with the delay than it takes to complete the flight. Supposed to depart at 11.17am, yet here we are on the runway at 11.52pm.",-1
2017-08-05,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Cleveland to Melbourne via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,United is a disgrace,False," We were late an hour leaving out of Cleveland en route to Melbourne via Los Angeles on United Airlines. They scheduled the international leg to depart less than 45 minutes from the flight arriving from CLE. Upon taxiing into LAX they advise us our gate is unavailable due to another plane being there for maintenance; something they could have and should have known when we were in the air. We sat for 23 precious minutes on the tarmac and when we were released from the plane ran to our international gate where we could see our plane only to have the door slammed in our faces followed by an insincere ""I'm sorry"" from the gate crew. Then we had to wait in the customer service line at 10:30 pm for almost two hours to be given paperwork for another flight the next evening that amounted to nothing. The airline wouldn't pay for our hotel of which at midnight cost us $293 for the night. When discussing with United's customer service agent he continually blamed it on weather which was never even an issue. They lie, do not care at all about anyone's feelings, are unapologetic, and rude. We will never fly them again. United is a disgrace.",-1
2017-08-04,0.1,Business,First Class,Ontario to Columbus via Denver,3.0,,4.0,,,4.0,1,No more chances,False,"  
Flew Ontario to Columbus via Denver. I only fly a few times a year, when I do, I confirm First class. I have a wide rump, so I pay for the extra room. This trip, United Airlines chose to change the aircraft, resulting in me getting bumped from First to Economy, even though I paid for First. They would only provide $250 for the forced move to Economy, which is less than I paid for the difference between the two classes. I can only assume that the original aircraft was not oversold... they downgraded the size plane, so they wouldn't have any unsold seats. United Airlines will forever be at the bottom. No more chances.",-1
2017-07-31,0.1,Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,how this airline still exists,False,"  London Heathrow to San Francisco. Not sure how this airline still exists in modern days. The least you can offer is proper entertainment on an 11 hour flight. The only entertainment is connecting your own device (mobile, tablet or laptop) to their wifi. Now, imagine this: 300+ passengers trying to connect to the same wifi at once. I had to wait until they served the meals and everyone was busy eating to be able to connect. I have to say, later during the flight it was better, but i guess because most people were bored from trying and just went to sleep. I am not a tall person, and I never notice leg room, but not on this flight. It is noticeably crammed. Seats are old and torn in places. I unfolded the tray and seat in front was torn. They provide electrical sockets under the seat. However, due to short leg room, it is very hard to plug anything in, and to even keep it without knocking it out. Food is a disaster. Lame and old, and not properly packaged. It was just wrapped in a plastic sheet, not sealed. The quantity is small. I was never hungry at the end of a flight like this one.",-1
2017-07-30,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Indianapolis,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,been sitting on the plane for almost 3 hours,False,"  Will never fly with United again. Flew Chicago to Indianapolis. Was told at the terminal that there would be a slight delay due to cleaning and maintenance of the plane. Once this was ""completed"" all passengers boarded the plane. Then to find out there was still an issue. The service crew was called by the captain and they either ignored or blew off the call several times. We have been sitting on the plane for almost 3 hours, and are still waiting. This is utterly ridiculous. It is causing people to miss connecting flights and delaying others arrival home.",-1

2017-07-29,0.7,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to London Heathrow,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,return journey wasn't so good,False,"  London Heathrow to Newark on a morning flight and really enjoyed the experience. We were supplied with drinks and hot food, and had a great selection of entertainment whilst being able to charge our phones & laptops. The staff didn't keep trying to flog us duty free goods which is always a bonus.  However our return journey on 18th July wasn't so good. Poor entertainment with very limited choice and screens the size of postage stamps with no device charging facilities. Not everyone wants to sleep on a night flight. Also the hot meal was dreadful. Slimy cheesy sauce with horrible wilted spinach and some substance masquerading as chicken. These minor gripes aside, I would fly United again - just not on a night flight. Much better facilities & entertainment on the day flight which was an all round more enjoyable experience.",1
2017-07-29,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Newark,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"No offer to reimburse""
",False,"  We flew United Airlines from Seattle, WA to Newark, NJ on July 1, and from there we were to have a connecting flight to Norfolk, VA. Originally our route was supposed to be Seattle - Chicago - Norfolk, but a day or two before our flight United changed the route to go through Newark instead. We arrived in Newark with no mishaps and when we went to a United counter to see what gate our connecting flight was leaving from, we were told that flight had been cancelled, but no reason was given. Instead, we were directed to a customer service counter with a very long line and only two agents assisting customers. Come to find out, United cancelled several flights from Newark that day. After standing in line for almost two hours (while also trying to talk to a person on the United hotline number while in line and receiving no help), it was finally my turn to speak to a desk agent. The agent was no help at all, and told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and since it was a weather issue, he told me United was not responsible to help with lodging, rental cars, etc. The soonest we could be booked on another flight was the following Monday, July 3. His solution was my family of four was welcome to remain in the airport throughout the weekend. That being an unacceptable option we, and apparently every other United customer affected by cancellations, went to rent a car and finally found a car available to drive to Norfolk. After cancelling our flight, the best they can offer is for us to stay in the airport for two nights and three days? No offer to reimburse, no offer to help with the rental, not offer to reimburse baggage fees. Not even some empathy form the agent. Not flying United again. And after relaying my experience to family and friends, neither are any of them.",-1

Flight attendants had ""I hate my job attitude"".  One gave a sarcastic remark when I asked if she still had the same drink available. They served 2 small meals that were over 10 hours apart with a snack in between. The snack was a small sandwich that was smaller than your palm and a mini bag of M&Ms so you feel hungry for most of the flight. Whole atmosphere was unpleasant -  dirty bathrooms, uncomfortable seats, unhappy crews. I was hesitant to choose United but gave it a try because of cheap fare and my prediction was accurate. The entertainment screen was small and not in good working order.",-1

Traveling with a legit (60lbs) service dog and notified the airline 45 days in advance. Told me they was seating me where the service dog would have ample room not to effect other passengers. On day of flight we load the plane and in the smallest area on plane squeezed in with another passenger. Guess that's what I guess for being conciderate and letting them know well in advance. Staff seemed like they could care less. Last flight with this airline.,-1
2017-07-26,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Washington,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,I am severely disappointed,False,"  Upon approaching the customer service representative in order to upgrade my ticket to Business for my flight from Zurich to Washington, the rep was rude, abrupt, curt, and completely inattentive. I am a nurse and was landing in IAD directly going to work for my night shift. All I wanted to do was rest. I had explained that to the rep who didn't seem to really care at all. At that moment of contact with that Rep I chose to not upgrade as I felt that United does not invest the money that I would have spent to train its employees but rather allow them to get away with treating the passengers in an ugly manner. The rest of the reps at that station were no better. Every single one of the customers at the desk (total of 8), walked away grouchy and angry and I cannot blame them. I am severely disappointed especially given the ugly reviews of United as of late, thinking that more effort has been put into better customer service. This may be the very last time I fly United unfortunately as I would much prefer to support an American airline but not at this cost.",-1

I was enroute to my wedding and their first craft was gate swapped with another. We had to deplane and move to a different gate and after getting on the new plane it just stopped there for hours. By the time we left it was 4 hours late. I asked if they could call the gate to hold my connecting flight since I can make it. All I need was 15 minutes. None of them cared. None of the flight attendent was willing to help. They are also a bunch of racist scums that sarcastically told me that I better run to my connecting flight across the airport. So if you wanna be treated like this then fly with UA. For me I'd rather fly with another, even if I have to pay more.",-1

We got into the flight and the flight started moving at 6am which was the original departure time. After 5 min they realize that there were aircraft issues.

Unreliable, unpredictable, unapologetic, and uncaring. I was originally supposed to depart from Rochester at 10:15am, stopover in Chicago, and then connect to Madison, but my flight from Rochester was delayed for an and hour and a half due to mechanical issues, causing me to miss my fight at ORD, which they resassigned me to a 3:50pm flight which is now delayed for an hour and a half. I was supposed to arrive in Madison by 1:30pm and now I won't get in until after 6pm. The entire point of my trip was to surprise my older sister at a dinner before she leaves for Indonesia for two years, and I now I won't even make it.",-1
2017-07-22,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Miami,,,,,,1.0,1,still suck just as much,False,"  Houston to Miami. You would think after everything going on with United lately, they'd get their act together but they still suck just as much. I had a flight this morning which was cancelled due to ""weather"" even though there are flights before and after that one that are still on. I was told it was probably due to weather elsewhere and so they couldn't get their crew or airplane here. They send me a message at 2am and my flight was at 10. I call and the wait is over 45 minutes. I only had the option to reschedule for 7 am and I was about an hour from the airport. I saw this message when I woke up and rushed to the airport. I actually had plenty of time to make the flight but I was told to make a line for about 45 minutes, even though I told the United Airlines employee that helped me that my flight was cancelled and I was on another one which departed in about an hour. After making that line I was redirected to a second one that took no less than 20 minutes. So, by the time I actually got to speak to someone, that flight was no longer an option. I asked her if she could send me on another airline (I know they can do that when they screw up) and she said no because it was due to weather. As if it was due to weather where I was at or as if them being so slow and having such long lines was also a weather issue. I am now on standby for a flight at 2pm which she told me I probably won't be able to get on because it's fully booked and there's nothing else available until tomorrow. Nice one United!",-1

When I flew with Delta to Boston, they sent me and email to confirm the night before and everything was efficient. Here, there was no email and they forced me to pay $25 for a small carry on bag.

2017-07-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Business Class,Orlando to Calgary via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Never fly with this horrible airline,False,"  Flew Orlando to Calgary via Denver. I've been to more than 25 countries, flying with many different airlines over the world and United Airlines is for sure the worst one I have ever been with. In 5 days a flight was cancelled, our bags got lost, other flight was late, making me lose a connection flight and making me stay one night in the connection city. They didn't even want to give us a hotel voucher because it ""was not their fault"". Most of the company workers treat customers horribly with bad manners and being rude, with some rare exceptions. The workers are never there to help you. When you ask for their help for ticketing or luggage issues they simply say: ""There is nothing we can do"". United Airlines managed to mess up me and my family's vacation in a few days. So my recommendation: Never fly with this horrible airline. Oh, and a small detail: mine and my whole family's tickets were for Business Class, and you still receive that poor kind of treatment. And when they change our flights, they put us on economy class. Such a joke.",-1

Two years ago I flew them and they delayed and cancelled my flight, after 7 hours of promising we'd get off the ground.  United Airlines string you along in the hopes that no one asks for a refund. No regard for their customers, they should just be honest so that people can make arrangements early. Flew them again (no other flights ) last week, and low and behold, the same thing happened again. Fool me once I guess. On top of that, their staff was incredibly rude and dismissive. Terrible airline, avoid at all costs.",-1

This airline doesn't allow you to take a carry on larger than a backpack, so I had to check my small suitcase that any other airline would consider a carry on. My flight that was supposed to leave at 1:00pm was delayed 11 times and cancelled once. When I was finally able to fly out it was 10 pm. When I arrived in Washington I was told that they had left my luggage back in Cleveland and it would not arrive until 11 am the next morning. This was a problem because I had a meeting at 10 am the next morning. United said they would update me about my luggage, but they never did. I called at 11, when my luggage was supposed to arrive and they told me they would deliver it to my hotel in 6-7 hours. Needless to say I drove back to the airport to pick the luggage up myself. The entire trip I encountered rude and incompetent staff who seemed unwilling to perform the job they had been hired to do. I will never fly United again.",-1

Every gate that I passed today was delayed for no apparent reason other than what seems to be business as usual. Then they have the nerve of creating this Basic Economy class that limits you from taking on a normal carry on so they can charge you an extra $25 each way to check what would normally be a regular carry on. Today, before my flight from Asheville to Newark I passed numerous empty seats and overhead bins and sat on my 3.5 hour delayed flight. I will avoid United at all costs.",-1

2017-07-16,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kansas City to Hartford via Chicago,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,wouldn't fly with them again,False,"  Kansas City to Hartford via Chicago. My flight (#1936) from Chicago to Hartford was supposed to depart at 9:17 on July 17th, 2017, and arrive in Hartford at 12:30 am on the 18th. Before arriving at O'Hare, many passengers had received multiple texts/emails stating the flight was to be delayed with significant fluctuations in the delay time with each message. After everyone had waited at the gate for 2+ hours, we were told that the flight was to be cancelled because there was simply ""no crew."" The manager thought it was a proper compensation to just give $10 meal vouchers to the passengers and then told us to all get in a line for customer service. Almost all the passengers, including myself, waited in line for over an hour, being told that perhaps we could get a hotel room courtesy of United until the next flight out that wasn't already overbooked, which made many for around 9:20 PM almost 24 hours later than the original flight. As we were standing in line, an employee gave us papers telling us to call a customer service number that might be able to help us out, which had the majority of us on hold for 15+ minutes. When I was finally able to speak to a representative, the conversation was unhelpful as there was seemingly nothing that could be done. As the end of the line reached the desk, we were told that the hotels that United could offer rooms in were booked up and that they couldn't offer us that either. I managed to get on a flight out at 6 AM on the 17th as part of a standby with a few other passengers- out of the fully booked flight that needed to be in Hartford 6 hours prior. Overall the experience was disgustingly unprofessional on behalf of United Airlines, and I wouldn't fly with them again, even if I was paid to.",-1

This airline has no regard for customer service and are rude to their customers. I'm waiting an extra 7 hours for my flight with no compensation because they don't care. This seems to be happening time and time again with this airline. Can't say I will fly with them again. Very disappointed with the customer service. The flight attendant on my connecting flight looked like he had just rolled out of bed and didn't even come around to offer drinks or collect trash. Customer service was disrespectful and did not help at all.,-1

2017-07-13,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Harrisburg to Minneapolis via Dulles, Chicago",3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0,1,my worst flying experience ever,False,"  First and foremost this was my worst flying experience ever! We started are day by being at the airport at 7.30am. in Harrisburg, PA. We boarded plane (American Eagle) and were pulled out on tarmac and we had to stop due to no flights in or out of Philly. Weather cleared, we pulled out and the crew had to abandon flight due to mechanical issues. That brought us to our only option of flying United Airlines to IAD at 2.25 in the afternoon to get to a larger airport with more options. We had to wait for an incoming flight from IAD which was delayed due to a foul smell but we finally left after 4.00. Before leaving Harrisburg we had to change our connecting flight to MSP thinking there is no way we will make it. As it turned out we did make the flight, just barely. The plane was loaded and the door shut and we were ready to pull out. The entire flight had to get off and re check in because of a computer error. We were reloaded and then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours, flight crew not helpful, we were finally told we had to go back to gate for more gas which was a lie. In reality the flight crew timed out. No other crew available. The United help desk was so not helpful and horribly slow to re-book passengers. After nearly half an hour to 45 minutes we were able to finally get re-booked on flight to Chicago and then we would have to stay overnight and fly to MSP in the morning. At this point it was after 9 at night. We flew to Chicago (O'Hare) and luckily the flight scheduled for MSP was delayed two hours so we were able to make it home at 2.30 in the morning. I have to say the only good thing about the whole day was the flight crew on that last flight. Thanks to them my 13 year old son was able to make it to his soccer tournament.",-1

Worst experience I have had. Maintenance issue on the plane out of Fort Wayne to Chicago, they delayed it twice. The first time they delayed it, we were going to miss our connecting flight so we had to change our flight from Chicago to Anchorage. After getting off the phone the first time, I check my new itnerary and it didn't have my husband and I sitting together after I had told the lady we had a lap child. I called back to explain this again and she said for us to sit together I would have to pay to be upgraded. Meanwhile the flight out of FWA was delayed even further due to a part not coming in, and so I had to find an alternate route. She couldn't find me anything out of FWA that day, so we ended up having to drive to Chicago. Only then, when I told her we were driving did she upgrade our seats for us to sit together. On the way back, we cancelled the flight back from Chicago or Fort Wayne as our car was parked in Chicago. The desk in Anchorage said our last leg to FWA was never cancelled so our luggage was going to be sent there, I asked her to cancel our last leg and the lady at the desk told me I had to call to cancel it myself, and that they couldn't print off a baggage tag to have our luggage end up in Chicago. After being on the phone for 20 mins and the lady on the phone not understanding anything (as they never did every time I called, which was 5+ times) they were calling all United flights to Chicago to check in. So I finally gave up and had our luggage sent to Fort Wayne. I wouldn't recommend flying on this airline if you have a conncecting flight. I wouldn't recommned flying this airline if you have children. The fact that their plane was screwed up due to maintenance and the unhelpfulness of the staff to try and help us get to our destination was absolutely ridiculous.  When she couldn't get us out of Fort Wayne on June 28th, the lady on the phone said she could reschedule us for July 30th! I had also gotten up to change my son's diaper in the lavatory. There was a drink cart blocking the lavatory in the front due to the pilots using the bathroom / getting coffee at the front lavatory and the pilot told me I had to use the back lavatory. So I walked back and the flight attendants were about 5 rows from the back with the drink cart, then the flight attendants said I had to wait until the pilots were done to use the front one. I asked if they could push the drink cart back for me to get through and I would wait to go to my seat until they were finished. She said I needed to wait to use the front one, I just couldn't wait up by cockpit. So I held my son for about 10 mins in the aisle before the pilots were done getting coffee to change my son's dirty diaper in the front lavatory.",-1

The policy has changed so much that it almost sounds like United doesn't want to retain cutomers anymore. On this flight from San Francisco to Phoenix, for basic economy passengers, not only they now want $25 for each carry-on they also force everyone to checkin the carry-on. This is a disgrace. First of all, the airline is greedy enough to charge carry-on fee. Secondly, they like to cause an incovenience to their passengers to have to wait for baggage claim after landing when it is carry-on and can be stored in the overhead bins. United Airlines is a prime example of corporations that wrongly put profit before customer experience. In my next time flying, I will surely stay away from United Airlines.",-1

I've flown with United Airlines many times, and this one was the last straw. They are typically unresponsive, slow, and rude. This time was no exception and it resulted in a delay.that delay turned into a longer delay due to weather which wasn't their fault, so I was understanding about that. However, after an hour and a half, the crew didn't want to wait any more and went home. At that point, my 9:17pm flight got bumped to 8:30 am. United offered no compensation with the exception of a 40% off coupon for some hotel I didnt want. They don't care about their customers. That's all there is to say. I'm never flying with them again.",-1

Website showed nothing saying I couldn't. Upon check in I was told that we were unable to take a carry on and would have to pay $25 dollars per bag to be checked. So there went $50 dollars. Let me add how rude every employee I met for them was! Absolutely no help or care in the world. Then we get to the gate and I see almost everyone bringing on both. With normal amount of overhead bins in the plane. So there is absolutely no reason for them not allowing carry on bags. I will never fly with them again.",-1
2017-07-03,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Chicago,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,1,never been charged to watch tv,False," We have been met with charge after charge flying with United. My husband and I originally booked our tickets to San Francisco and had to pay an additional $100 for the option to sit together and have a carry on! How does one go on vacation without clothes?! The trip fell through and we ended up changing to go to Cancun, Mexico instead. We were charged $400 plus about $50-100 in processing fees to change. Not only that, we were met with many additional costs that are new to us. I have flown many international flights and have always been given a meal. On this flight however, we were given a bag of pretzels and would be charged extra for snacks or a meal. I have also never been charged extra for a checked bag on an international flight. (We were actually allowed a carry on) Lastly, I have never been charged to watch tv. United offered no free entertainment and their directv option was $8. It was not a pleasant experience and I will absolutely be avoiding united in the future.",-1
2017-07-03,0.3,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to London,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,"delayed flight, bad service",False," It is a comedy to fly United from San Francisco to London. 11 hours flight without a personal screen and TV. I have never seen it in my life. The flight departed with 2 hours delay and I had to buy new train tickets. The food selections were limited and all the time the options were finished. A delayed flight, bad service and horrible experience.",-1

Four out of four flights have been delayed, missing all connections. So disappointed and cannot imagine how I could recommend United Airlines. Four out of four flights is no coincidence - perhaps poor planning, poor employee compensation, as well as poor service.",-1
2017-07-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Boise to Detroit via Denver,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,United culture does not value the customer,False,"  I had purchased my ticket a week before my flight and paid double what it would have cost. I paid over $900 for a flight from Boise, Idaho to Detroit. I was forced to pay an extra $25 to check my carry on bag. I explained to the attendant that there is no reason to check my carry on. At the gate I saw everyone coming off of my plane with backpacks and carry ons. I explained to the attendant, that I will be arriving in Detroit at 1am and I could not spare an hour or more to walk all the way to baggage claim to collect this carry on bag that I could easily take on the plane with me. It was your typical, the customer is nobody attitude. She could not care less about my opinion. Obviously United culture does not value the customer. I ended up wasting 1 hour and 45 minutes to collect my small carry on. Does anyone at United care that I got home at 3am? I don't think so.",-1
2017-07-02,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Minneapolis to Manchester,2.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,2,so many delays,False," Horrible. So many delays on this United flight from Minneapolis to Manchester, NH. After sitting all day in the airport, we finally start boarding and many of us are given tags for our bags to gate check them, saying they don't have enough room in the overhead compartments. There was plenty of room when I boarded the plane. I wanted to grab my bag so I didn't have to wait after landing for then to get it from under the plane. They wouldn't let me! It was sitting 4ft from the door! Needless to say it was a mad rush to the next flight. Not impressed.",-1
2017-07-01,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Kona,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,use a different airline,False,"  February 2017 UA1721 Moved to Hawaii, because of the time of year, locked in to using United Airlines PetSafe program. A fiasco. My recommendation is to fly a different time of year, use a different airline. United is more expensive than any other. We were told to be at the PetSafe cargo area 2 hours before flight, we arrived 3.5 hours early so we wouldn't miss the flight. The woman checking in pets was so slow that all of the pets ahead of us and ours got on the flights on time, we all got to the airport late. All missed our flights. A few minutes late to load luggage ruined the whole trip. Luggage has to be with passengers, pets do not? Put on another flight with 2 airlines, 2 airports, pets had to be boarded, needed a hotel, etc. until the next day. The price difference with the next booking was over $600.00 with no price adjustment. There is never enough help at the counters, people miss flights because of lack of employees. Pets are put in overnight boarding, an extra expense and extra stress on them. Money spent on hotel and food because you need to stay your first night on the island to pick up pets the next morning. Never again.",-1
2017-07-01,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Washington,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,their bad customer service,False,"  Newark to Washington. I'm currently waiting at the airport in NJ. We where suppose to leave here at 8:29. They've cancelled the flight went back and said it wasn't cancelled, and they've re-adjusted the flight 10 times within the last few hours. We called customer service to see if we could be compensated for this major inconvenience and they say ""well your still leaving tonight"". They offered no compensation at all. Now they claim we are leaving at 2:09am. This is ridiculous and unprofessional. I had a 4 hour delay with southwest before and they compensated everyone on the flight and we didn't even have to ask them. They did it on their own accord. My husband waited on the phone for over an hour just to be told that they aren't going to do anything. This is why they're always in the need for their bad customer service.",-1
2017-06-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Knoxville to Boston via Newark,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,By far the worst experience,False,"  Knoxville to Boston via Newark. By far the worst experience I have ever had flying! Our flight was delayed in Knoxville for 4 hours, we were supposed to leave Knoxville at 11:15, we finally left Knoxville at 3 (no one could ever explain to us why) we landed in Newark, NJ, around 4:40. We were told we would be able to make the 6:25 flight to Boston (granted we were supposed to land in Boston at 4pm) our flight was delayed 2 additional times, we finally left Newark, at 9:20 and landed in Boston around 10:15. We lost an entire day. No one would/could ever tell us what the delay was. We spent a total of 12hrs in 2 airports. I have flown on numerous occasions and I have had minor things happen but I have never had such a horrible experience with an airline. Not only was the flight experience bad, dealing with the rude airport staff was worse! Customer Service is obviously not part of their training for the job. We only had one lady go out of her way to help us, she was at the Knoxville airport, she was the only good experience we had with United! She did all she could to keep all 6 of my family members together. One lady I talked to had my 8yr old on a separate flight with her 15yr old brother. It was an absolute disaster. My family and I will never use this airline again.",-1
2017-06-30,0.6,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Honolulu,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3,"Legroom was also tolerable"" ",False,"  First time flying this route from Houston to Honolulu and I was not looking forward to it. Why? 8 hours in the sky with no free hot meals (you have to purchase from a menu and it's not cheap - $10 for a burger), no in-flight entertainment screens, and a sardine can economy cabin with the 3-4-3 seating arrangement. All this in mind and I was not eager to fly. As I boarded the plane and settled in my seat I noticed that yes the seats got narrower to accommodate more seats across but the seats are also new and well crafted with details. The seat was made out of this leather with detailed stitching patterns and a tag on the side that had the United logo on it and it had a cool color scheme to it too. Not only did it look good but it felt fairly comfortable for a small seat and the cushioning was decent. Legroom was also tolerable and take my word for it because I have very long legs. The seats didn't have those necessary in-flight entertainment screens but all seats were installed with a tablet/device holder so you can comfortably watch free entertainment on your personal device via the United wifi. (Make sure you have downloaded the United app before you board). The wifi connectivity was fairly strong though it didn't work the last half of the flight. Cabin crew were pleasant. They had poise, well groomed and very polite and I have no complaints or problems with them. The only huge disappointment I have is that for an 8-hour flight, no free meals were offered! It felt like a long-haul budget carrier flight! Of course, there was a full drink service. If you wanted to eat, you had to order from the menu a wide selection of hot meals that costed upwards $10. If it was that expensive then it should taste good I thought - which did. $10 Mediterranean chicken wrap was a rather small portion for a $10 meal but the tastes were worthy enough for you to think it came from Chipotle or something.",1
2017-06-30,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Very dishonest business practices,False,  Flew United Airlines from Denver to Los Angeles. Very dishonest business practices. I packed super light so I could fit everything in a small backpack since you have to pay extra to check a bag. Now you have to buy an upgraded seat to even use overhead space! I was forced to check my 7lb backpack for $50 round trip because it's too big to fit under the seat in front of me. Outrageous! I won't be flying with this airline again.,-1
2017-06-29,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Los Angeles via San Francisco,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,2,will not be using them again,False,  Honolulu to Los Angeles via San Francisco. I just completed four flights with United Airlines within a weeks time and will not be using them again. The ground service attendants were downright rude in all three airports. All of the flights were overbooked and slow to board. On the three of the four flights all inflight entertainment and wifi was by purchase only. The LA to Honolulu flight we could use the screens on the seats for free with a variety of movies. The other flights had Direct TV screens which required credit card swipes.  The 5.5 hour flight from Honolulu to San Francisco only offered one beverage service and no food cart. The flight attendants came through only to ask for garbage. Overall the airlines came across as a penny pinching organization that didn't care about customer service and lost sight of the cost involved for families to travel.,-1
2017-06-27,0.6,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to San Diego,4.0,,4.0,,,3.0,3,a pleasant experience,False," Check in was a challenge given the touch screens did not work properly. Staff were on hand but while friendly left before they could verify that the issue was solved. It was solved in the United Club. This meant that check in took much longer than it could have. Security cleared quickly, lounge was pleasant. My wife and I despite having the same booking number could not be seated together but this may have been due to changing our flight the week before. This also meant a downgrade to economy but on this short flight from San Francisco to San Diego doesn't make much difference as there is little on offer in either class. Flight left a little late but arrived on time. Plane was clean and comfortable and crew were very friendly. In all a pleasant experience, bags were available within 5 minutes of being at the carousel.",1
2017-06-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Los Angeles,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,recommend going back to the drawing board,False," I am reviewing the Boeing 737-900 I flew from Chicago to Los Angeles with United. Basically a bad design (from the 1970s) with a new plastic facelift. No legroom for a 5ft 10in person - knees hit table metal, and no room for feet under Seat in front. Seat recline limited with entertainment screen in my face when person in front reclines. Use of laptop impossible! Now for my comments on the 1970 entertainment system, paid $8 and could not watch movies on demand - 5 hour flight, but always missed start of movies and tv shows - it's 2017. And then the controls for the entertainment system were located on the seat arm - needless to say that my neighbor got very upset several times after I changed her viewing channel  Finally my expensive headphones could not save the poor quality 1970 audio jack plug and sound. Recommend going back to the drawing board!",-1
2017-06-24,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never been so disappointed,False,"  Detroit to Newark. My mom has been working for United for over 28 years so when I fly I use her buddy passes. Using her buddy passes this means that I fly standby (which means I only get a seat if one is available). I decided to fly home for the weekend so I decided to fly from Detroit airport to Newark on June 23rd. There were about 15-20 open seats on this flight so I knew there should be no problem getting on the flight. There were a few delays due to air traffic control and that is normal and expected on a busy day like Friday. After waiting a few hours in delays, it was finally time for my flight to board. I stood right by the podium as I waited for everyone to board and once they finished I went right up the front desk to ask if any stand bys have been called yet. The lady said she wasn't sure and that she had to wait for one of the other agents to come back because she would have the answer. I waited about 5-10 minutes for the other agent to go back and I nervously kept looking at the screen to make sure that I didn't miss my name being called but the screen still said ""Boarding"" and my name was not checked off the screen yet despite all of the empty seats. The United agent finally returned and when I asked her about the stand by's she had nothing to say to me. All she said was that the doors were already closed and that I would not be making it on the flight. I did not understand what she was saying because there were no announcements made AT ALL about final boarding. Not only did the agent forget to call the whole stand by list, she never announced that boarding was coming to an end. Before the flight even began boarding, I specifically went up to the Agents and told them I was flying stand by and I asked them if they would be calling out my name so that I could receive my ticket. They assured me they would call me once everyone else was boarded. However, this was not the case at all. While this whole ordeal was happening, I was talking to my mom on the phone who told me that she never has seen something like this in her 28 years of flying. She was very upset by this as was I and instructed me to see if there was something else I could talk to. When I asked the lady if I could talk to someone else about this problem, she told me there was nobody else I could talk to about this issue. The lady then began to ignore me when I continued to talk to her about this problem. I was absolutely baffled on how an airline could just get away without giving a final boarding call for a flight. There was also another person on stand by who missed out on this flight because the agents never made the proper announcements. This was the last flight out for the day so it caused me to be stuck in Detroit for the night when this never should have happened considering there were over 15 seats open. Not only did the lady refuse to help or even tell me what happened, she failed to do one of her basic duties as an agent - which is make the proper announcements. I am a college student who cannot afford to pay to spend a night in a hotel so this left me in a terrible situation. I have flown United my whole life and I have never been so disappointed with them as I am today.",-1
2017-06-24,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Washington,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,attendants offered excellent personalized service,False,"  This was the best economy class flight I have had on United in a while. Flew San Francisco to Washington. The service was great, all attendants offered excellent personalized service - eye contact, smiles, all the right stuff. Beverages were offered at least four times during the 4 hour flight with snacks being offered twice. It was a real pleasure. We took off on time and landed about 30 minutes early. Even boarding, with an outsized Group 1, was fast and efficient. A very positive experience overall.",1
2017-06-24,0.5,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Houston,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4,close to mediocre,False,"  Tokyo Narita to Houston. I've previously taken this route four years ago and I was expecting the same. Well, that wasn't the case. For a trans-pacific flight, the flight crew was not approachable or polite in any matter besides maybe two who did an excellent job. There was one who was very sarcastic and rude to a passenger and another who was not knowledgeable of the food she was serving. The food portions were rather small compared to a domestic trans-con flight. For dinner, they served chicken rice or pasta with a roll and a cup of salad, and vanilla ice cream.  In the middle of the flight, they served snacks. Ice-cold ham & cheese sandwich with Asian-style trail mix and a chocolate. The sandwich was terrible. I gave praise to the crew walking around the cabin giving away water in between meal times. Then before landing, breakfast. Cheese omelet with a ""rubber"" sausage and hashbrowns or this Japanese chicken rice with this bourbon cookie. The crew was not very presentable and mediocre, some of the crew looked like they just lazily put on their uniform without a care of how they looked. There were only two crew who had a smile on their face the whole flight. Some had the expression of regret for choosing their career as a flight attendant, some were just tired and wanted to go back to the crew rest, and some had great poise. The seat was rather decent for a 12-hour flight. Great legroom and recline degree and the cushioning are comfortable for sleep - there were even pillows and blankets. There was also an IFE screen on each seat but none of them worked the entire flight. The crew tried their best to reboot and get it to work but it wouldn't budge. No movies or TV programs would work but games and the flight map did. It was a good thing there was in-flight wifi which you can connect to use the United app where you can enjoy free entertainment with latest movies and TV shows free of charge. Before I went on this flight I flew into Tokyo Narita from Manila and arrived at Tokyo on-time at 2:50 PM but this flight was due to depart at 4:30 PM. So once I arrived my boarding pass didn't have info on the gate number but there was a United representative giving info specifically about that. Approachable and polite. The overall flight experience was decent - close to mediocre due to inconsistent cabin crew and meager cabin product compared to ANA who fly the same route on a higher level of service.",-1
2017-06-24,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Dallas to Omaha via Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,offered no help whatsoever,False,"  Dallas to Omaha via Chicago. My colleague and I were traveling for business this morning and had to be in Omaha by 10:30 AM. Our initial flight from DFW was delayed due to weather and that was going to cause us to miss our flight from Chicago to Omaha. We ended up cancelling the whole trip since we would not be able to make our meeting. I get it, no one can control the weather and flights had to be delayed, I'm not upset about that. What I am upset about is their solution to this series of unfortunate events. We were immediately shut down at the airport by the United concierge lady and she said that these reservations were non-refundable and there was nothing she could do. She suggested that we call the 1-800 number and they may be able to help us further. Once I got back into the office I called the United Airlines 1-800 number. Once I was connected to a live representative she said that she would be able to credit those trips back to both of us for future use with United ($128.80 each), but we would have to pay a ""flight change"" fee of $200 EACH. She basically told me that we would each have to give United Airlines $200 before we could use the $128.80 credit that each of us have.  What I am taking away from this is that United Airlines does not care about it customers and the situations that they are put in. We had no intentions of cancelling these trips and only did so because we had no choice given the circumstances. They offered no help whatsoever and did not provide any sort of solution to the unfortunate situation that we were both in. My colleague and I wasted $257.00, and United Airlines said that we can still use that money with them if we give them an additional $400.00.",-1
2017-06-23,0.8,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Denver,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,experiences continue to be positive,False," For a domestic, US flight, United 1262 Newark to Denver was reasonably pleasant. The row 20, exit row window, provided more-than-ample leg room. The advertised food options were available and of quite good quality, and the service, despite the fact that the aircraft was completely filled, was very satisfactory. The AVOD screens in the seatback in front offered an excellent choice for in-flight entertainment. I don't know if this was intentional, but the screens were activated w/o charge. In addition, the personal device entertainment system worked well, and I was able to watch ""Lincoln"" while keeping the flight map on the AVOD screen. My experiences with United continue to be positive, and I hope that this positive experience will balance the plethora of negative reviews.",1

Plane left late, so I missed my connection. Then new connection delayed over two hours, so I will get in after my rental car office is closed. Customer service was no help at all. Inflight WiFi kept stopping. I am a United Mileage Plus member, and it gets increasingly more difficult to earn upgrades and flights. Wife is a big Delta Airline fan and gets upgraded all the time. Flew Delta last month and was very happy. Time to switch from an airline that just doesn't try any more.",-1
2017-06-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Jacksonville,2.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,This was a huge mistake,False,"  I booked a flight with United Airlines flying from PHL to JAX, with a connecting flight in Newark. First of all, I always fly American Airlines, but this time I decided to try out the cheaper option. This was a huge mistake. I signed up for flight updates twice, once when I bought the ticket, and once when I checked in for the flight ahead of time. I get to the airport and it turns out that they booked me on a train to Newark without making that clear. Luckily, I was early like I always am for my flights so I lugged my two suitcases to the train station to catch the train to Newark. After all this, I get to the counter in Newark and they tell me my flight was canceled. Mind you, I made sure my phone was on and charged all day to make sure I would be notified of any changes to the flight. The United employee told me the next flight out was for 7am the next day, but that they would not cover the cost of a hotel for the night, despite it being their error that put me in this position. I then ask if I can have them cover the cost for a train back to Philly, and they print the ticket out right there and hand it to me, and then they tell me if I want to get to Jacksonville (my original destination) that I would have to pay for a whole new ticket. When I make it clear that it's unacceptable for me to be forced to buy two full-priced tickets to the same destination, they tell me the ticket they handed me back to Philly was non-refundable. Then I ask if I can at least get on the 7am flight they mentioned before, but now they're telling me that it's completely booked, as well as the flight after that. The next flight I could be guaranteed a seat on is over a day from then, and again, they will not help with hotel costs. By now, I'm livid, and I talk to a supervisor and they take the ticket back, telling me they wouldn't be able to give me a refund on my ticket at all, despite it being their error that put got me stranded in Newark. After calling customer service I finally talk to someone who will give me a refund, but now I'm forced to buy a ticket for over a hundred more because it's last second, when I originally bought my ticket over a week ahead of time. They should have at least offered me the soonest flight from a competing airline, but they gave me nothing except a guarantee that I'll be paying hundreds more out of pocket for an absolutely terrible experience. I have been on several flights, both domestic and international, but United has by far been the worst experience I've had ever. Bad customer service, bad reliability, no notification system for flight changes, and little clarity in their system overall. I will gladly pay extra to fly with American Airlines (really any airline except United) from now on!",-1

Haven't flown United for years and now I remember why. Had entertainment that we were required to pay for and very uncomfortable seating. Of course, we only had a cookie and one drink going to Maui. Return trip from Maui was over an hour late boarding, and we are sitting on the tarmac as I type because the gate is blocked with a broken plane. Going on 30 minutes so far. We had no entertainment since wifi was not operating and the free entertainment was thus not available. I won't even mention the stewardesses. Not into their job.

2017-06-20,0.1,Business,Economy Class,"Chicago O'Hare to Jacksonville, FL",1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,you cannot select a seat,False,"  Flew Chicago O'Hare to Jacksonville, FL. Basic economy, what a scam. Means you have no options, no rights. You cannot select a seat, it will be assigned upon your arrival, good luck. You cannot check-in 24 hours in advance. You have to check-in at the airport and hope you get a seat. I booked a flight under Basic Economy fare for $585 (not cheap!) not fully understanding the restrictions. My bad, buyer beware. You will be the consumer that is ""bumped"" when they are over-sold, which is the case on every flight. I am a Premier member and a loyal United customer for over 25 years. The member who would always select United over American, Delta and other airlines. I called for help. Answer: Sorry nothing we can do, the system won't allow us to override it. But, if you pay a $200 change fee plus additional $35 fare difference, we can cancel the Basic Economy and issue a non-refundable ticket. Now, no longer a United Loyal customer.",-1
2017-06-19,0.5,Business,First Class,Kona to Los Angeles,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,3,experience was kind of bizarre,False," As a long time Hawaii resident, I stopped flying them years ago for the same reason as everyone else. I decided to give it another try from Kona to Los Angeles and was really hoping for a good experience. It wasn't horrible but well below the standards of even Delta or Hawaiian.The aircraft is ancient and the only entertainment available is if you know in advance to download the United app. There is no advance notice of this, there is no WiFi at Kona airport anyway. If you haven't done this there is nothing. Unbelievably no one told the crew boarding had commenced and I walked into a dark cabin to find flight attendants sleeping in row 2. Embarrassing for all. Once they woke up the senior staff was actually fine with the minimum they are given to offer. Food was ok although oddly dessert consisted of a single piece of chocolate offered on the tray next to some crackers. No bread or salad was offered. This for a 5 hour flight in first class us a bit bizarre. The flight was on time, the crew was fairly pleasant, the seat minimally acceptable for 5 hours but really the experience was kind of bizarre due to all of the above.",-1

Mediocre airline, seat is normal US ""first"" class. If we had breakfast, I don't remember. Plane was clean, on time departure and arrived in Cancun.

2017-06-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Seattle via Chicago,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,airline is just a joke,False," This is my first time using United Airlines and it is by far the worst. When I first arrived to print my tickets for Baltimore to Seattle via Chicago there was only one lady at the counter and about 7 customers waiting for her to take the bags, and it was slow. I didn't give it much thought, figured it was just one bad apple in the batch. Then I get 3 texts saying the flight was delayed a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes. Now I'm standing at customer service in the Chicago airport were they only have 2 people helping a huge snaked line. This airline is just a joke.",-1
2017-06-18,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Cedar Rapids,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4,felt well informed,False,"  Flew United Airlines from Denver to Cedar Rapids. Pilot did an excellent job of communicating with passengers as we encountered threat of developing severe weather and possible need to divert route on a late day/night flight to Cedar Rapids. He kept us updated as flight progressed and really appreciated his emphasis on safety, felt well informed as we saw flashes of lightening and huge thunderheads in the dark and dealt with turbulence for much of the flight. He was able to move alongside the line of storms while just keeping ahead of them. We no more than touched the wheels down in Cedar Rapids and the rain hit. The passengers erupted in appreciative cheers and clapping; grateful to be safely on the ground just before midnight and did not have to divert to Minneapolis. Thanks to an excellent pilot and crew.",1
2017-06-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Melbourne to Los Angeles,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,1,the flight worst I have ever taken,False," United Airlines hasn't improved. This flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles ought to be the worst I have ever taken. Not because of the lenght, nor because of aircraft, simply because of the rudeness of most flight attendant on board. I think United should review their interpersonal skills with some of their staff. Only 3 staff were polite, the rest were just plain awful. Flight attendants going down the aisle pushing people without excusing themselves - really! I understand they have to work but could they have been polite. Working with public isnt easy, so if you cant do it: find another job. I had never flown United before and for sure now, never will. Next time I will go Air New Zealand again: ""They"" know how. You might as well be stuck somewhere than flying United. It avoids aggravation.",-1
2017-06-17,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,disgraceful level of service,False," I've been flying United for years and this was one of their worst flights ever. They fly a massive Boeing 777 on this  Honolulu to Houston route and every single seat was sold. The boarding process was disorganized and unpleasant. Due to slight turbulence, the frowning flight crew weren't allowed to serve drinks until 2 hours into the flight. Once they got moving, they were constantly hitting into people and waking them up all night. There were no free meals, no AVOD, no smiles, and the flight crew were absolutely unapproachable and miserable. It's a shame that Americans are willing to tolerate such a disgraceful level of service from this carrier.",-1
2017-06-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Albany via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,horrible customer service,False, United is the worst airline I've ever flown. Started out at 3:00 am traveling to Las Vegas to catch flight to Albany via Newark. I've never seen so many delays in my many years of flying. Still sitting here in Newark at 10:00 pm with no end in sight. The just keep delaying our flight. Who knows when we will get to Albany. Rental car and hotel booked in Albany and United couldn't care less. If you're planning a trip - don't fly United. I would look elsewhere. Horrible customer service.,-1
2017-06-15,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nassau to Houston,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,do not recommend this airline,False,"  I always hope for the best when flying United, but I am always disappointed. Today our flight was late arriving to Houston, my sister's bag was not on board the flight and has to be delivered later to her home. I do not recommend flying this airline. I prefer Southwest. This is the third time my bag, or someone I was traveling with have lost their bags.",-1
2017-06-15,1.0,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Houston to Boston,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,4,both flights had great service,False,"  Flew Houston - Boston and return last week with United Airlines. Both flight were on time, both flights had great service and friendly helpful staff. Is there room for improvement? Of course there is, but this time I'm not complaining. B737 and return A319 were clean and crew were excellent. I came in late on Icelandair on my way back and had to run from E to B in BOS and the staff member at the United desk did save my day by issuing my boarding pass and guided me to security so I made my flight back to Houston.",1
2017-06-15,0.6,Couple Leisure,First Class,San Francisco to Washington Dulles,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4,the food is mediocre,False,"  
Flew San Francisco to Washington Dulles and return. United's standard domestic first class is reasonably comfortable. The new Boeing 737-924s have United's latest amenities, including entertainment and flight information delivered to your pad, smart phone or computer via internal wi-fi. The selection of entertainment options is quite good and free. You must bring your own earbuds or headphones, even in first. Wi-fi otherwise is pretty dreadful and not worth whatever you pay for it. The inflight dynamic map is completely useless. First class service is quite good and attentive, but the food is mediocre. Gone are the days when the flight attendants constructed an ice cream sundae for each first class passenger, replaced by mango sorbet in a cup. Meal selection is handled rather oddly, with first choice going to those with the highest frequent flier tier status. Thus, even if you pay full price for your first class ticket, you may come up at the bottom of the pile in choosing your meal. Not endearing.",1
2017-06-14,0.7,Business,Premium Economy,Orange County (CA) to Orlando via Houston,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,a fairly happy frequent flier of United Airlines,False,"  I am actually a fairly happy frequent flier of United Airlines, but you (and they) need to know what inconsistencies and problems flyers experience. Here are just some of the many independent situations I've experienced in 6 months (2017), all with United Airlines. 2 x jetway failures – Upon arrival at gate, had to push plane out and had to wait on tarmac for another available gate. This made us 45 minutes and 35 minutes late these two examples. One of these examples, I missed my connecting flight. Had to sprint to connecting flight on the other. 2 x flight crew members didn't show up for work - one 1.5 hour delay and one flight cancelled (after several hours) and had to stay overnight in Houston. Was forced to pay for most of hotel room. Luckily I was first in line to get rebooked the next morning and was also able to get an airport hotel room. Others were not so lucky 2 x sensor failures - On two separate trips had to return to gate after pushing off, one time there was no immediate gate and had to wait on tarmac for over an hour. Another time, plane was taken off service and we waited for several hours for a replacement. 2 x late planes – Planes didn’t arrive on time (not weather-related) and once we took off and landed at connecting airport, I had to run from terminal to terminal to make connection. Most other passengers doing the same connection did not make it. On the positive side, I will say that my status does help me solve many other problems that come up (some weather-related, some not), but for non-status passengers, those other situations would have been horrific. Also, Economy Plus is really the only reason I can enjoy my experience as much as I do. I am treated well by United team members, and Economy Plus seat spacing is enjoyable even for a 6'3"" person.",1
2017-06-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dulles to Denver,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,staff were unprofessional,False,"  Flew Dulles to Denver with United Airlines. The staff at the front desk were rude! They refused to answer any questions I had and wouldn't even tell me where I needed to go. They were unprofessional and forced me to check a bag after one employee said ""it's good it fits"", the other employee refused to let me past the desk. Then the person at the counter allowed 5 different people to cut me in line for no apparent reason. The staff were unprofessional and honestly due to the lack of customer service, I will never fly United again!",-1
2017-06-14,0.9,Business,Economy Class,Lisbon to Newark,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,4,amazed with the level of service,False," Flew United from Lisbon to Newark and then returned to Brussels. I really did not have any great expectations of this airline. I just hope that I will arrive and return safe and sound. Not to mention this is my first time flying with them. It turns out that the flights were really pleasant. FA did good job on both flights even though not particularly charming if you used to fly with QR or SQ except for a male FA on United 999 who was exceptionally nice and polite. B767 looks very spacious with newest IFE, B777 shows its age but still in a good shape. The inbound flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we arrived just slightly behind the schedule. Both landings were probably among the smoothest I have experienced. The food was rather small in portion but with a decent quality. My pre-order meal (MOML) was well served something I really appreciated. The collection of movie might be limited if we compare to those of EK, QR, or SQ but I managed to watch two very good ones released in 2015 and 2016 respectively. All in all I am very happy and quite amazed with the level of service.",1
2017-06-14,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Portland to St. Louis,1.0,,1.0,,,2.0,2,will not be flying United again,False," For my Portland to St. Louis flight with United, I was forced to check my bag when I had the correct carry on with me. I did not want to wait for baggage claim when I got home because I knew it would take a long time. They told me that the carry on was too big and made me measure it. (This is the same bag and belongings I flew with on the way here and it was totally fine). They bag was packed a little too big and I said all I had to do was move my belonging a bit around because I had just gotten something out of it and that's why it wasn't fitting correctly. I was told I still had to check it and no one seemed to want to help or accommodate. It was the worst customer experience I've experienced in a long time. I will not be flying United again.",-1
2017-06-13,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Denver,3.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1,they nickel and dime you for everything,False,  Flew from Salt Lake City to Denver. United Airlines is now joining the ranks of prestigious airlines like Spirit and Frontier where they nickel and dime you for everything. For the first time ever I was charged $25 for a carry-on bag and only allowed to bring my backpack. This is why I avoid Frontier and Spirit and now I'll be avoiding United.,-1
2017-06-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,San Jose to Washington via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,treat customers with contempt,False," United's Basic Economy fare gives employees a mandate to treat customers with contempt and provide sub zero service. Unfortunately, United fare's from San Jose to Washington via Chicago was the cheapest. I work for the City of San Jose and have to book the lowest fare. I figured the fare was the lowest because of United's recent issues and as a result I would get at least okay service. This has not been the case. I've now learned that United has now created a new class called Basic Economy, which apparently does not work with self check-in. I did not realize that this fare meant, not only would I have to check my bag but would have to pay $25 or $50 if I took it to the gate. My seats get assigned at the gate by rude agents. As required by this fare I was the last to board and saw many open seats. I got all the way to the last window seat I was told with a huff that taking one of the many open seats farther forward would be a $119 upgrade.",-1
2017-06-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Dallas Fort Worth,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,delayed almost 12 hours,False,"  Due to United Airlines incomparable incompetence my arrival was inexcusably delayed almost 12 hours. For a company who's customer service is already hanging by a very thin thread you would think that they would be doing everything to make your flights as smooth and pleasant as possible. And yet, on this day at the end of a very long journey, I find myself inflicted upon by their abysmal brand of service especially in regards to scheduling, and accountability. United Airlines first moved my first international flight up, only to delay it when I got to the gate back to its original time. I faced frustration and boredom being trapped in San Francisco airport facing not one, not two, but what became seven delays? Delays that have been caused by runway maintenance. A almost four hour delay that could have been easily avoided if you just had things together and scheduled your planes around the affected runways. Let's not forget the additional delay caused when the flight crew simply couldn't be found to come to the gate so we could start getting underway! After the above delays myself and my fellow passengers were finally able to board our flight - only to be told by the captain that there would be another brief delay while we waited for another crew member because one of the pilots was near the end of their union hours. We sit on the plane stuck for another 20 minuets or so, only to be told they can't find anyone, and can we please get off the plane because our whole flight is cancelled. A whole flight full of people kicked off of a plane, the majority of them with no other flights to their destinations. There were other flights, my bag for instance was on one of them. I know this because it's now 11.37 at night and the airport is very full, as were the lines to the customer service kiosks. Speaking of the customer service, the kiosk I get to is uncrowded but understaffed and run by clearly undertrained employees. The ones I'm dealing with keep having to ask each other for help, and give advice/plans that contradict one another. (All of this happens while the loudspeakers ask for a last call to a last flight to Dallas - the city I'm trying to get to) one of them even takes what seems to be a personal call while 'assisting' me (could have been work, but there was a lot of giggling). When I finally get hold of a supervisor I have to plead to get the next flight out of this godforsaken place, which I am reluctantly given as its with one of your competitors. Almost 12 hours later I do finally make it home - thanks to American Airlines.",-1
2017-06-09,0.9,Solo Leisure,First Class,Los Angeles to Honolulu,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,5,good and experienced crew,False,"  Los Angeles to Honolulu. Very good flight experience thanks to very good and experienced crew. As usually on the route from California to Honolulu the aircraft was not the newest and the seats were not the latest either. And as usual the staff is rather older and more experienced (seniority principle on this routing) then on any other route on the planet. But the always friendy, smiling and efficient crew did more then compensate for old seats or plane. One staff did the cooking and the other one did the service. All in a very personal and efficient way, one felt like being already in Honolulu. The food and the drinks on offer were good and well sized. The entertainment system is rather limited and on a small tablet screen. The crew was one of the best ever on a plane, and it was most enjoyable to watch them serving with joy and fun.",1
2017-06-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Corpus Christi to Houston,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,they are not competitive at all,False,"  Corpus Christi to Houston. United Airlines is the worst airline. The people are unfriendly and do not know how to treat customers well. I will try at all matters to never step in again in a United Flight unless they improve their service. By the way, they charge for everything like checked bags. Basically, they are not competitive at all.",-1
2017-06-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Houston,1.0,,2.0,,,3.0,1,Who knows if I'll ever get home,False,"  Don't fly United! They always have delays for whatever reasons. I fly a handful times each year, and unfortunately, I have to fly United since they're based in Houston. I'm sitting at the airport in Vegas now waiting for our plane to be repaired. We all boarded, sat there for half an hour, then deplaned. Supposed to leave at 11.30 am, delayed until 3 pm, delayed again until 4 pm. Who knows if I'll ever get home. So many people missed connecting flights. While sitting here waiting for the plane to be fixed, I hear agents announcing that this flight or that flight is overbooked! This seems to be the norm with United. I've only left on time once in the past 8 flights. Some delays were due to weather, but most were not weather related. If you have options, choose another airline.",-1
2017-06-08,0.4,Business,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Singapore,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4,ground staff need major changes,False," The flight San Francisco to Singapore itself wasn't bad. The negative review is for the United staff at SFO. I am Star Alliance gold via Krisflyer but was using my MileagePlus. I was told I cannot use the priority lane or get a priority luggage tag because Krisflyer isn't Star Alliance. When I showed them the card which clearly says Star Alliance gold, they reluctantly gave me the priority tag on my bag. Upon arrival to Singapore, my bag is one of the last bags out (35 min wait) and does not have a tag. Furthermore the bag is all wet. The flight wasn't bad but the ground staff need major changes.",-1
2017-06-08,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Washington DC via Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,So much of our time wasted,False,"  
United is absolutely ridiculous. For the price you pay you get no guarantee you're going to get there on time. After delays then sitting on runways for upwards of an hour to incur further delays on the next flight in Jersey. You pay a ridiculous price for a service expecting to get where you request at the time you request it. Totalling upwards of 3 hours of delays, a food shortage on the plane, overhead bins clearly designated for passengers instead crammed with United employee paraphernalia, they've clearly taken away what precious seat space was left as you will be knees to the seat in front of you. Wifi isnt free as they advertise, no it is only free to view their partnering sales advertisements. Don't bother making plans for transportation upon arrival as you aren't promised you'll arrive on time. So much of our time wasted. Planned on using the metro train systems upon arrival but that can't happen as our flight will arrive hours after close of major public transportation. So we will incur further unexpected costs in transportation, to make up for the mess United Airlines has left it's passengers in, with No regard to the inconvenience or disregard for their customers time. I suggest Delta or Southwest to this airline any day. Never again.",-1
2017-06-07,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to IAD,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,unprofessional travel experience,False,  On flight from Los Angeles to Washington Dulles the staff was extremely unpleasant. Not over concerned at that position not but then on arrival one piece of our luggage was lost. This was a direct flight and one piece missing? Came to find out that 10 people from our flight lost luggage. Several conflicting explanations were offered but after an hour we all left without our luggage. On our return flight was told after boarding that the only way to watch anything was by streaming thru our own devices and that we must download the United app. Of course that wasn't possible for the large number of attempts to access internet and App Store. Probably wouldn't complain but then we were delayed after we were seated. It was explained that they had no pilot or flight crew. Would drive to get us a flight crew and pilot ASAP. An hour after boarding we were told that the pilot Was at the airport and would begin preparing to leave. Still attempting to access App Store. I will never use United Airlines again!! By the time we back away from the gate we have already been seated for an hour and 20 + min. Most unprofessional travel experience.,-1
2017-06-07,0.6,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Hamburg to Newark,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,5.0,3,"nothing exciting, but solid",False,"  Hamburg to Newark. We got a free upgrade to premium eco so me and my travel companion could sit together - which are standard seats with standard service and extra legroom - which was a decent move. Customer service is friendly and helpful, however the crew was a little rude. The Boeing 767 was old but not worn down, the IFE was aged as well. Cannot complain about the food (chicken or Pasta), but both flights were delayed at least one hour, HAM-EWR even 2,5 hours. Thus, United is a typical US carrier: nothing exciting, but solid.",1
2017-06-07,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Tampa,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,poor planning and management,False," United is garbage. They loaded the plane from Houston to Tampa and we sat there waiting for the pilots for over an hour at the gate. Terrible communication. No remorse, poor planning and management. Try to avoid flying them. Worse then the budget airlines in my opinion",-1
2017-06-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Raleigh/Durham,1.0,,4.0,,,4.0,1,haven't learned how to treat their customers,False," I am officially done with United Airlines and do not plan to use their service ever again. They are on the same poor quality list as Spirit Airlines now. Yesterday I checked in early for my flight from Newark to Raleigh/Durham via the United Airlines app and received a pop up message. The message stated one personal bag was allowed and a full size carry was not allowed. I was instructed to check in my full size carry on for the price of $25. When I attempted to bypass this message another message popped up stating if a full size carry on arrived at the gate I would be charged $25 to check the bag in and an additional $25 would also be added as a service fee for last minute baggage check. I went on the United's website where I saw carry on bags were allowed on the plane. Nevertheless I didn't want any problems so I checked in my carry on for a price of $25 when I arrived to the airport. At that point I asked a floor customer service representative about the notification I received regarding the full size carry on. I was informed that I was not allowed to bring a full size carry on because I purchased a ticket at a reduced rate on priceline.com. If I purchased my ticket through United at regular price I could bring my carry on onto the plane complementary. I could not believe it. To make matters worse when I arrived at the gate and they began to call passengers by group number, the representative clearly stated in her announcement passengers boarding with group numbers 1-4 may bring on a carry on luggage. I of course was in group 5, therefore I was disqualified. Although I saved money purchasing a ticket via priceline.com, in the end United made that money back by forcing me pay for my carry on bag. That is a clear Spirit Airlines move. You can get a cheap flight but you have to pay for other things. I see United still haven't learned how to treat their customers.",-1
2017-06-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Detroit via Chicago,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,just appalling,False," Have flown United Airlines from London Heathrow to Detroit via Chicago several times over the last few years. The aircraft are old and the minute you step in you get the feeling of arrogance from the crew, old women about to retire and clearly fed up. Not enough chicken meals for everybody, had to get a tasteless pasta meal. My connection to Detroit got delayed by 6 hours and got an apology email with a silly $50 discount on the next flight. No thanks. Worst airline ever. Avoid United Airlines at all cost. Just appalling.",-1
2017-06-02,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Bangkok to Cancun via Houston,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,the worst inflight experience,False,"  Bangkok to Cancun via Houston.  Narita to Houston return I paid extra for a Economy premium seats. In flight service was extremely poor, flight attendants on both flights were unfriendly, spoke in rude tones. None of them ever smiled or expressed a word of greeting. Snacks were thrown on the lap of passenger who was next to me since he was sleeping. Quality of food was extremely poor, no presentation, servings were small. Bun/sandwich served for snack was dry and hardly edible. There was absolutely no value for additional money I paid for Economy premium seat. It was uncomfortable seat, with hardly any difference of leg space in the ordinary Economy class. There was nothing pleasant about the in flight service of 12- 13 hour flights both ways. I have over 30 years of flying experience with difference air lines, United Airlines was the worst in flight experience. I will never choose to fly UA again.",-1
2017-05-31,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to San Diego,5.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,3,"ok to ""Dip"" tobacco and spit",False,"  Chicago to San Diego. Service was great, Flight Attendants were friendly. Food was offered on our flight, I got a chicken wrap and it was larger than I expected and tasty. The seats and leg room were larger than on most planes I've been on lately so for a almost 4 hours flight it was comfortable. My only complaint is when did it become ok to ""Dip"" tobacco and spit in a bottle ? The guys next to me enjoyed dipping the whole flight, getting fresh dip several times. The smell (minty like malox) gave me a headache but that fact he was allowed to spit in a bottle while I was eating was just gross. I don't normally fly United and I have never had this happen before. Is this a normal allowed practice?",1
2017-05-31,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to San Francisco,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,planes are old and very dated,False,  Frankfurt to San Francisco. This is the return leg of a flight I booked with Lufthansa. The first flight was both Lufthansa planes. This return flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco is United Airlines. I know they are sister airlines but I swore last December I would never fly United Airlines again. United planes are old and very dated.,-1
2017-05-31,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Denver to Boston,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,"anxiety, anger, and tears",False," Extremely disappointed with the treatment of a first-class passenger. We purposely booked our 16 year old daughter in first class so she could feel safe with the attention of the airline staff since she was traveling a long way by herself (Denver to Boston). She was booked in row 3A, and upon arriving at the gate, was called to the counter. The gate agent said, ""We are trying to find a seat for you"". No explanation. She called me upset because she did not know what was going on. I told her to go back to the counter and show them her itinerary and confirmation. She did, and the same agent responded with, ""There is a broken seat in first class. We are trying to find a seat for you"". Again, no confirmation that she will get eventually get a seat on the flight. My daughter looks at the available seats being displayed on the monitor and notices middle seats available from row 10 and up. Thirty minutes goes by with no communication. Then my husband asks to speak to the agent via my daughter's cell phone, and the exchange was so heated, the agent slammed the phone down on the counter. My daughter picked up her phone and walked away from the counter without either gate agent saying a word to her. Simple, clear communication showing they care would have gone a long way instead of leaving a 16 year old in tears. I ended up calling United and the agent switched me to a manager right away. The manager said she was being assigned seat 21A window seat (even thought the gate agents at that point still hadn't said anything to her); or the reservation manager could switch her to a first class seat on the 12:30pm flight instead of her 9:50am flight. My daughter preferred to wait until the 12:30pm flight just to avoid the gate agents. A simple, caring, clear communication from the gate agents would have avoided a lot of anxiety, anger, and tears. I know she would have easily taken row 21A if she wasn't so upset, but now she never wants to fly United again, and I don't blame her. We'll all do our best never to take United again.",-1
2017-05-29,0.3,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Denver,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,3,poor customer service,False,"  San Francisco to Denver. United continues to have no clue what their customers want. I attempted to fly standby on a flight in order to get home 1 hour earlier. Yes I was asking for a ""favor"", for my own convenience but i figured if there was room, why wouldn't an airline take care of its customers? After talking to customer service, they confirmed the flight to have many empty seats. Unfortunately unless I was premium status, there was a standby fee of $75 per one way flight. Wouldn't it be easier to keep customers happy whenever possible? Beyond customer service, this is bad business practices. The airline business is time critical; once a flight leaves, an airline can't make any more money from that flight for ticket sales. By moving up passengers to earlier flights, an airline can reserve the future potential to sell more seats on later flights. Why would an airline limit future growth potentinal? Especially when at the expense of the customer experience. My complaint is small compared to many news worthy stories, but just another example of continued poor customer service from United.",-1
2017-05-27,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,will never fly them again,False,"  Chicago to Los Angeles. United Airlines has the worst service. Having a trip with multiple intenarys I was told I needed to check my carrying on bag, normally I would not have an issue with this but seeing I had a flight to catch with a $1000 ticket this was not an option. The staff loading the flight were unwilling to cooperate and allow me to bring the carry on aboard or offer a solution to get my bag. They forced me to check my bag not giving me enough time to make my next flight. I will never fly them again.",-1
2017-05-27,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kona to Portland via San Francisco,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,not fly United ever again,False,"  Kona to Portland via San Francisco. While checking in bags for a flight from KOA to PDX the credit machines /kiosks went down and though the ticket agent asked us to try several times (3 to be exact) we were not able to pay on the kiosk with a credit card. We waited patiently with the attendants and a growing line of passengers behind us for over a half hour. After the agent confirmed there was an issue with ""the lines for the machine"" and we were told ""it was being worked on"" the attendant said she would check our bags for FREE. She checked us in for our flight printed our bag tags and boarding passes and we went on our way, boarded, and flew home. Today there are three separate charges for $75 each on my bank card, for a transaction I was assured was free! Unacceptable. I was extremely patient and understand that tech issues happen but there is no excuse for poor customer service from the 800 number provided by the charging agent. When calling the phone number next to the 3 transactions on my bank account for customer service I was told that they can't help me! Why have customer service agents that cannot fix problems. I am currently waiting on the phone and have been waiting for an hour and five minutes for a resolution to this problem and will certainly be filing a formal complaint. To top it all off, during my call with customer service the supervisor that I spoke with tried to blame the ticket agent! All of the agents at the airport, physically checking passengers in did a great job under the conditions. With every kiosk down they managed to help all of the passengers checking in for their flights while dealing with technical issues. I'm certain there are several other passengers that have experienced the same problem! I stood at the counter and waited while the gate agent called for assistance and was told it was a system wide problem or slow age. She did a fantastic job and provided excellent customer service and I wish I remembered her name so she could be recognized for been extremely helpful while trying to check in my family of five, included three children, for a flight home. We will not fly United ever again after this experience. The only reason I'm giving them any star for a rating at all is because the page forces me to.",-1
2017-05-24,0.9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Los Angeles,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,crew were friendly enough,False,"  After all of the awful publicity that United received in the months leading up to our flights I was concerned that I had made a terrible choice for our journey from Sydney to Los Angeles. However, my 14 hour economy flight was probably about as enjoyable as any economy flight can be. United flies the lovely new 787 on this route, the air quality is better, the lighting is better and the seats, although they look really small, are actually amongst the most comfortable I have flown on. Video Entertainment is great, although the lack of audio was a bit frustrating, take your phone or Ipad along for this. Wi-Fi for purchase is a fun option to pass the time and costs are reasonable. The food was OK, a meal on departure, a snack in between and then a rubbery egg breakfast before landing in LA. The reality is this was an economy flight, the fare was really really good value. We resisted the constant sales push before the flight to purchase economy plus which does provide extra leg room if you feel you need it, at least with United have this option at a pretty reasonable rate if you feel you need it. By the way, this flight was spot on time as were all of our other United internal flights, boarding and disembarking was smooth as anything. The crew were friendly enough and seemed pretty happy about servicing our requirements, they appeared older than on most other airlines but were chatty and responsive.",1
2017-05-23,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Saipan to Guam,2.0,,1.0,,,4.0,3,average and unfriendly service,False,  All United flights between Saipan and Guam are operated by Cape Air aircrafts. Actually it's about 30 minutes flight and so I could put up with uncomfortable seat and average and unfriendly service. Anyway there's no alternative flights. Check in is quite quick and all other Saipan airport services as well.,1
2017-05-22,0.2,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Washington to Dublin,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,2,most outdated and terrible business class,False,"  Washington to Dublin. Worst Business Class in the world, aircraft was a Boeing 757-200, in Business Class. This flight was advertised on the UA website and even on the boarding pass as new United Polaris Business Class, with ""Redesigned seating, luxury bedding and calming amenities offer the ultimate comfort for relaxation and sleep"". My expectations were quite high. You cannot believe my disappointment and disgust when I boarded the plane and found out the business class cabin was most outdated and terrible business class I have ever seen. The seats were incredible old, tired and dirty. There was no access to the isle for every seat. There were scratches, dents and dints everywhere in the cabin. The crew was working in the galleys without any curtain to the cabin. So we had the full galley light in the cabin at all time. Toilets were outdated. They were clean but the bins very completely full soon and have not been emptied during the flight. There was no mouth wash, hand cream, toothpaste, combs or anything similar which is standard for all other decent airlines. The food was kind of okay; the wines were actually excellent.  The UA lounge at Dulles airport was the usual UA standard (slightly disappointing). At 9 pm there was plenty of seating available which was nice. There were two just soups on offer to eat; most of the alcoholic drinks you have to pay for.",-1
2017-05-21,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Santa Barbara,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,United would not work with me,False,"  United would not work with me when my flight was cancelled due to weather. My flight in SPS was cancelled to DFW, which meant I could not make my flight from LAX to SBA because I was not able to get from DFW to LAX. American was understanding and worked with me to get me to my destination multiple times while United told me to pay more than what the ticket was worth or to just basically let it go. The insurance is worth nothing from both United and the traveling company used as the travel company has the same plan as United. I used to fly United all the time, but now I will be avoiding them like the plague. Im very satisfied with American Airlines and highly displeased with United Airlines.",-1
2017-05-20,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Newark,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,can't trust United for my travel needs,False,"  Flew Chicago to Newark. If you're serious about getting to your destination unscathed, do not fly United. I recommend not taking United to all of my clients and vendors. United lost my luggage twice and every flight I have been on has been delayed. I simply can't trust United for my travel needs.",-1
2017-05-20,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Kansas City,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,generally a terrible airline,False,"  Most recently I was flying from Rome to Kansas City, via Turkish Airlines and United. Connecting through Chicago, my flights switched to United from Turkish Airlines. Turkish Airlines was able to ensure my bags made it from Rome to Istanbul to Chicago all in one piece despite multiple delays and a very long layover. United lost my bag in the 1 hours flight from Chicago to Kansas City. At the baggage claim the gentlemen said it was still in Chicago and would be delivered the next day. It was not.  Unfortunately, they were still unable to recover my luggage as of 3 days after landing, forcing me essentially try to make excuses for not having the promised items at the meeting with my clients. I filed additional claims for my luggage twice, neither of which were even responded to. 4 days later, I called again, and was told my luggage was simply lost. I unchecked rechecked the bag in Chicago after arriving from an international flight, and they somehow lost the bag. Trying to get United to cover the costs of what was lost is proving to be even more nightmarish. The quality of service is astounding awful. I have had delayed bags before with United, but now having them simply lose my bag on such a short flight, and then fight me at every step when trying to claim the bag is shockingly despicable. If I would have known my Turkish Airlines flight was using United for the last leg, I would have never bought the ticket, as United is generally a terrible airline anyways for constant delays, uncomfortable seats, and delaying my baggage constantly. But this has trumped all other experiences regarding terrible care and costing me literal thousands of dollars for their negligence.",-1
2017-05-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Orange County to Montreal via Chicago,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,far from being a good airline,False,"  This company doesn't deserve to be a Star Alliance member. I'm an elite member with Air Canada and United Airlines is far from being a good airline. First, no entertainment système and no power outlet in 2017 is unacceptable. Second, I had to change my flight and they switch my second flight with Air Canada to a United Airlines one without asking me. I had to make the change after I noticed it.",-1
2017-05-17,0.7,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Lisbon to Newark,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,4,a very nice product,False,"  Lisbon to Newark. The new Polaris Business class of United is a very nice product. The seats are comfortable, the screen is a nice size and the new amenities kit is excellent. The seats are lie flat and offer a great rest. However, they are somewhat difficult to adjust at the intermediate levels, the upright and lie flat are done at the push of a button. Other than that, the only complaint I had was for the lack of storage on the seat - the old seats (and this may have been the ones in first) and small nooks to store stuff. That is not the case here, or at least I did not find them - so the storage has to be done in the overhead bins. Besides the very comfortable oversized pillow, United also provides you with two blankets, a regular one, and a slightly heavier quilted one. I initially used the quilted one, but since the temperature in the cabin was quite comfortable I eventually gave up on both. The food is a little lacking, for the first course, I chose the Halibut which was very good but second meal was a very dry and flavorless piece of chicken breast. This, in my opinion, is a problem, primarily because it is served an hour before landing and sticks in people's memories as their meal experience. The service while professional is not on par with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. While I cannot put my finger on it simply lacks the elegance and savoir-faire of their counterparts. Another big issue is the entertainment, while there is an excellent selection I cannot for the life of me understand why I constantly have to be subjected to Barracuda and Marriott advertising - it is not just once, but after every single show that I want to watch. This really cheapens the United brand, if you want to do it on the domestic legs to offset the entertainment costs the so be it - but to do it on the international leg in business class is unheard of. United is definitely on to something with Polaris, with a little fine tuning this could become a Business Class for others to follow.",1
2017-05-17,0.7,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Sydney to San Francisco,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5,the leg room was awful,False,"  
Flew United Airlines from Sydney to San Francisco. The plane was fully booked and being a Dreamliner which is a smaller plane was very noticeable, the inflight entertainment was excellent but the headphones are poor so take your own. The food was nice and alcohol was free, the seat pitch was great but the leg room was awful. The trip itself wouldn't have been too bad if the staff were friendlier and there wasn't turbulence for the entire 14 hour flight.",1
2017-05-16,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Charlotte to Washington,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,customer service is the worst,False,"  I was forced to check my carry on because the flight was full. I told them I didn't want my bag checked but they told me I didn't have the option to bring it on board with me. They managed to lose my bag. When I filed the report at the airport they tried to put the blame on me, like I wanted me bag checked. Then they proceeded to tell me my bag had been located and it would be delivered early the next morning. The next morning came and went, no bag. I called to see what happened only to be told, ""we have located your bag and we will put it on the first available flight out and have it delivered to you asap."" I was, confused and irritated. I explained that my bag was located the night before and should of already been delivered to me. They then told me I could go ahead and spend $150 to replace the items in my bag while they got this sorted out. I thought, well at least they are trying to do right by me. This game went on for 4 days! My bag was finally delivered after I returned home from my vacation and after several angry phone calls. They kept getting my delivery address wrong, my bag color wrong and managed to ship my bag to several different airports before it finally made its way home. Once my bag arrived, I called United to get the $150 refund that they promised me plus some compensation given all the hassle. They actually told me, ""sorry, looks like whoever told you that failed to make a note in the system so we cannot offer you a refund now."" ""The best we can do is $125 travel voucher for your trouble.""  As if I'd want to fly with that useless airline again. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from these guys. The customer service is the worst I have ever encountered!",-1
2017-05-14,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hawaii to Chicago,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Extremely frustrating,False,"  Flew United Airlines from Hawaii to Chicago. Wifi is expensive and barely works. Only way to access inflight entertainment was through personal device and it requires United airline app. In order to get the app you must purchase the wifi. Purchased 1 hour of the wifi for 6.99 to download the app, only to find out the inflight entertainment isn't working. So I am instead using the wifi to write this review. Extremely frustrating.",-1
2017-05-13,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Reno to Burlington,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,I appreciate her help,False,"  Reno to Burlington. First thing in the morning at 4:45am today, I got to my airport and my flight left at 5:30 . I punch in my confirmation code and was alerted by United Airlines kiosk that the time to check bags has passed. I was told from a United Airlines staff that I would be put on standby and booked out in the afternoon. I hear someone from baggage say, ""we can still do it!"" I greatly greatly appreciate the woman who helped me, she shook my hand and smiled at me and told me it would be OK. I appreciate her help, and my vacation would be a completely different experience (not for the better I was afraid) if it wasn't for her. Thank you.",1
2017-05-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PDX to Mexico City via San Francisco,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,This is terrible service,False,  Portland to Mexico City via San Francisco. Scheduled departure at 6:55am delayed. Later we boarded and left the gate only to return to the gate and deboard. Told to wait in case we could leave. Left 3hrs+ late. Arrived in San Fran and learned we missed our connecting flight. Arrived at United Customer Service desk at 1:45am. The best replacement flight boards at 5:15am. No overnight accommodation provided. We will arrive at our destination 12 hours late! I am hoping that my two checked bags eventually catch up to me; I suspect I will need to make a return trip to the airport to get them.  This is terrible service. United Airlines continues to provide poor customer service. There were over a hundred passengers that share my same sentiment!,-1
2017-05-12,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Chicago O'Hare to Lexington,3.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,give United Airlines such a bad name,False,"  Chicago O'Hare to Lexington. My flight got delayed a few times and then finally cancelled due to weather. The weather was not the fault of United. When standing in the customer service line in F terminal we were all told that there was another customer service center in B terminal if we wanted to go over there. Everyone stayed in the line waiting patiently to get helped. There were approximately 5 or 6 people in front of me. The supervisor was standing behind the counter and says they are going to be going down to one agent shortly and we could go to B terminal if we wanted. We all decided to wait where we were since we did not know how long the line was in B terminal. Then all of the sudden he says that this counter in F terminal was closed. He never pulled the strap and closed the line. We all said to him that he had told us they were going to one agent and we were all willing to wait. Why are you now changing and closing the counter wile there are people waiting to get helped. He made his staff leave immediately. I walked to B terminal next to him and asked him for his name. He said I'm not giving you my name. He told me that he had worked 18 hours and can't work anymore or he gets penalized. When we all arrive at the customer service counter at B terminal it was exactly what we were all trying to avoid when in B terminal, Long lines! He then proceeded to go behind the counter in B terminal and continue to work along with one of the customer service ladies that was at F terminal. He had told me when walking to B terminal that the staff that had been at F terminal had would too many hours and could not work more. That was clearly not the case since they started helping people in the line at B terminal. We could have all been helped where we were and much faster than having to get in a longer line. His attitude and actions are completely unacceptable! This type of customer service is what continues to give United Airlines such a bad name.",-1
2017-05-11,0.2,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Chicago,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,last time I travel United Airlines,False,"  Los Angeles to Chicago. I will never fly United again. I couldn't even upgrade my seat. They have this new thing called basic economy, that they will charge you for everything. I will never recommend it. Stay away. Definitely this will be the last time I travel United Airlines.",-1
2017-05-11,1.0,Business,First Class,Austin to Denver,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,a really nice morning flight,False,"  From Austin to Denver First Class on an A320. Check In via the mobile App, which I find is one of the better airline Apps. United Club is Austin has just been changed around a bit, adding more seating with a better flow to it. Some fruit and something to drink and then it was time to board. I like the United's zone lanes, as it tends to help spread things out a bit better. In Zone 1, was the 4th person to board. Comfortable new interior on this A320, Good legroom and snack service, with warm scones once airborne. Watched some videos, again on the UA App and in 2 hours we were landing, with a ontime arrival. Flight attendants and gate agents were all excellent and professional, frequent updates from the cockpit. Overall a really nice morning flight.",1
2017-05-10,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Boston,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,2.0,1,will never fly United again,False,"  I wish I could say that I was shocked by United and their lack of attention to detail. After having our flight from Newark to Boston delayed for an hour with no explanation why, finally boarded the plane ready to put it behind me. We get the amazing news that's the plane doesn't have up to date maintenance logs, which means we're not going anywhere. As if it couldn't get worse they announce that only one air conditioner was working so it's going to be stuffy. I will never fly United again. I will pay 200+ dollars to avoid sitting on a plane with no air for over 35 minutes. Horrible experience.",-1
2017-05-10,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Denver,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,3,flight home to Denver was awful,False,"  This is my first trip I've planned with United Airlines in a very long time. My flight from Denver to Philadelphia was fine, I have no issue. My flight from Philadelphia home to Denver was awful. It was on one of their newer planes, and I had absolutely no room on this plane. I'm 6'1"", and I feel like I had to squeeze into my seat. I couldn't hardly move the entire flight, and after getting home, my body is still aching from that flight (two days later). I have a very limited budget and cannot afford the luxuries an upgrade has to offer. I can't help that I'm so tall, I don't feel like I should have to pay extra just to sit in a seat that won't leave my body hurting for days after. I've never had this issue on any other airline, even on newer planes of similar models. I'm not sure if this is a manufacturing defect, or they purposely made the rows so close together that I had to have my knees jammed into the seat in front of me (more so than usual), or the seats so tiny I could barely move or even buckle my seat belt. I am not an overweight person, I've never been this confined on a flight in my life, and I travel pretty frequently. This will definitely make me hesitant to fly United Airlines in the future, I've never felt this way getting off a Delta flight, even with their newer planes.",-1
2017-05-08,0.9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Burbank to LaGuardia via Denver,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,4.0,5,a great experience with United,False,"  I read several negative reviews about United. So pleased to write that I had a great experience with United mainline flights on my Burbank - NYC/LGA via Denver. Customer Service agents were pleasant and helpful. Flight Attendants were helpful, polite, and sharp and went the extra mile in providing true customer support. The airbus 319/320 are new or fairly new, as compared to old Airbus 320 aircraft on JetBlue's non-stop JFK/BUR or Jetblue's non-engaged and cold-attitude flight attendants and CSA's. Comfortable leather seats on all flights. Great climate control. I enjoyed connecting in United's Denver terminal, clean, bright and spacious and plenty of helpful and polite United agents.",1
2017-05-04,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Albany, New York to Steamboat Springs, Colorado",1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,1,sat at the gate on a stifling hot plane,False,"  My fiancé and I departed from Albany, New York for Steamboat Springs, Colorado over the holiday. United was seriously testing our skiing endurance. After sitting at the Albany gate for 20 minutes, the pilot informed us that the grounds crew forgot to load our bags! It’s not like we were the first flight. There was a United flight leaving at the gate over 30 minutes before us. My fiancé and I ended up running to our next gate because what was a 40-minute layover turned into a 15-minute layover in a different terminal. After sprinting up and down to the gate at Chicago, we arrived in the knick-of-time. We were able to grab salads at a stand outside the gate. After boarding the plane, we decided to eat our salads. Oddly we are able to finish our entire salad without moving. After sitting for 30 minutes, the pilot informed us there is an abnormal number of children on the plane therefore we were waiting for children life jackets. An hour goes by and we are informed from the pilot’s calculations we will need additional fuel, so we waited on the fuel truck. At this point all the young children who needed life jackets, are highly uncomfortable because the plane is becoming warm - over 80 degrees. It was an older plane so they could not turn on the AC. Think about all the poor parents! Scheduling is important to everyone’s well-being and we are now an hour and half late. If you can believe it, we were then informed the fuel truck put too much fuel in the plane! We are now waiting for another truck to take out some of the fuel. After sitting at the gate for an hour and 45 minutes, we were informed we will be leaving as soon as the second truck comes by because the first one broke down! We only sat at the gate on a stifling hot plane for two hours on what is normally a two and half hour plane ride. The 100-meter dash to the finish line was that half of all passengers bags on the plane did not make it to Steamboat ours included! We were in great shape to go skiing!",-1
2017-05-03,0.1,Solo Leisure,First Class,Norfolk to Honolulu via Newark,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2,stay way from United,False,"  Norfolk to Honolulu via Newark. Terrible experience! I haven't flown United in years and I wish I had kept it that way. They booked my flight with a layover in Newark, I had a carry on that they said needed to be put under the plane due to no room in the overhead bins, the agent put a green tag on my luggage, when we landed and I tried to get my luggage the agent asked me for my ""green ticket"", I then told him I did not receive a ticket and everyone else on line said they hadn't gotten one either, he said ""well then you'll have to go to the carousel to pick up your carry on"", thank god another agent basically said to ignore him. After we got the luggage we had to take a bus to the terminal, when I got to the terminal I knew we were cutting it close so myself and 2 other passengers ran to the gate where we were supposed to catch our flight to Honolulu. We ran up to the terminal and the agent said ( with great satisfaction) that we were too late, even though it was 10 minutes before our flight was supposed to leave. Why United scheduled our flights with no time to get to our connecting flights does not make any sense. Our flight was on time to our connecting flight but we had to take a shuttle and the gates were pretty far apart, we landed at 7:10 and our connecting flight boarded at 7:10! There was no possible way to make that flight. They put me on another flight but tried to give me economy class instead of the first class I paid for. I called the 800 number and they were absolutely no help, the agents in the airport rescheduled me on a different first class flight. The flight to LA the plane was nice, the food was great and the stewardess was awesome but from LA to Hawaii the first class plane was lousy, no tv's in the headrests and not much more leg room then economy class. Because of their mistake I've lost a day of my vacation and probably gained a few gray hairs. Bottom line, stay way from United, they don't have a clue.",-1
2017-05-03,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pittsburgh to Newark via San Juan,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1,our flight was delayed yet again,False,"  This was my first time flying and I was so excited. I wanted to take my whole family (parents, my sister, her husband, and my three children) on a great trip. I am a single mom and this trip was a long time coming. It took me a long time to save up to pay for this flight (for all 8 of us) and to pay for a place for us to stay. We get on the plane to Newark from Pittsburgh and we had to wait 30 mins because they didn't fuel the plane. Now maybe it's my ignorance but shouldn't that be done before the passengers get on the plane? Why have people waiting after all the crazy things you have to do to get through security check with 8 people. While we were on that plane they delayed our flight to San Juan from Newark four hrs. Now if I was by myself I wouldn't be complaining but with a family of 8 this was no walk in the park. But once again maybe it's my ignorance but the flight was delayed because they didn't have a working plane. This to me is just unacceptable. This is all without any other compensation other than meal vouchers. Partly my fault because I was to naive to think I needed insurance for such a trip. Silly me! After five hrs of idle sitting my children couldn't careless about eating. But that's not the end of this great vacation that turned into a complete nightmare. Our flight was delayed yet again. And we are still waiting! I'm so disappointed. Thank you United Airlines.",-1

Unfortunately, my family and I were unable to get a direct flight from our vacation in Punta Cana to Pittsburgh, we had to fly through Newark, NJ. After a 4.5 hour flight with no in flight entertainment (broken direct tv) we dealt with several gate changes and 6 hours of continuous delays with little information. The service individuals gave no information or options for passengers to have a positive experience. Currently still delayed in Newark.",-1
2017-04-28,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Raleigh,,,,,,1.0,1,plenty of other airlines,False,"  Had to fly from a Raleigh NC to Newark NJ due to my son having emergency surgery, he then had complications and was placed in ICU. I called United and asked if I could delay our flight by one day to return home and explained why. She told me they had seats available on the next day flight but we would have to pay the same amount as our round trip tickets for our one way return. This is outrageous! We were not there for a holiday and wanted to stay additional days. No compassion, there are plenty of other airlines.",-1
2017-04-27,1.0,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Salt Lake City to Paris via Chicago,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,a great job,False, Salt Lake City to Paris via Chicago with United. Our flight was held up in Chicago. This would make us late to our connection in Paris to Copenhagen. We went to customer service who very nicely and politely booked us on a later flight for all six of us in our party. A great job.,1
2017-04-27,0.9,Business,Business Class,SLC to MSY via IAH,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,4.0,4,did very well indeed,False,"  I encountered excellent customer service from the United staff on the flight from Salt Lake City to Houston, and from Houston to New Orleans. Flight 1718 was delayed by air traffic control for an hour, which meant an extremely tight, in fact, impossible layover in Houston [7 minutes]. The gate agent [Gate B7 at SLC] got me a reservation on the first flight out the following day as the flight from Houston to New Orleans was the last of the day. The agents kept us up to date and were optimistic that time would be made up and the outbound flight held a few minutes to accommodate enroute passengers. Apparently, meals for first class were not delivered on the previous flight and the gate agent ran down to buy 8 meals to make sure we got fed. The United staff did an excellent job in hurrying boarding and making sure those with tight connections had a good shot at making the next flight. It all worked out! I made the flight to New Orleans. Not surprisingly, the checked bag didn't make it, but it was delivered to my door two days later, at an address 120 miles from New Orleans. On this flight United Airlines did very well indeed.",1
2017-04-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Los Angeles to Melbourne,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,e worst flight experience,False,"  Los Angeles to Melbourne, and it was the worst flight experience I've ever had. Our itinerary was cancelled without any notification for missing a flight in the itinerary. This resulted in a chaos for our travel plans and we had to spend over 2 hours on the phone with customer services. After speaking to various supervisors our flight was reinstated, but all our meal selections and seat selections disappeared. Our family had to sit in different spots and with my daughter who turned 13 mid-flight could not be seated with her whole family together. Our food selection was also not available and as a result our family had to survive without much food. What a pretty special way to celebrate a 13th birthday. As a dad I was quite ashamed to fly my family on United Airlines! Also United planes do not have privacy filters on the TV screens and all the screens are visible from everywhere. With the person sitting next to our daughter watching ""R"" rated content it was also very disturbing. All they need on your screens is a filter and only the person sitting on front of it can see the information on their display while people on either side only see a darkened screen.",-1
2017-04-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Washington,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,2,pathetic customer service,False,"  I am a frequent flyer in United Airlines travelling about twice a month. It's extremely disappointing that I have been forced to check my bag time and again in while boarding, even when there is space in yet cabin. It is ridiculous! How can the cabin crew not communicate accurately to the people at the gate? I travel on business and so that I can move fast I travel light carrying only a cabin bag so I can zip to my destination as soon as I deboard as opposed to waiting at the carousel. This defeats the purpose. It's absolutely frustrating. And on top of that the lady at the gate was not courteous either: United certainly seems to be excelling at their growing reputation of pathetic customer service and it keeps getting worse. I wish I had more options to switch flights, I would want to avoid United. I have been patient but to go through this time and again is awful.",-1
2017-04-25,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Houston,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,1,continually declined,False," San Francisco to Houston. This airline has continually declined. I used to only fly United because the service was great. On the flight over my mom and I were separated despite booking over 5 months in advance. The gate attendees in Houston were so rude. They made us get out of line and offered no help despite the embarrassment and inconvenienve. Coming back, our flight was delayed by more than 45 min. I will never fly this airline again.",-1
2017-04-25,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Mobile via Houston,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I am very unsatisfied,False,"  I am very unsatisfied. Not one of my flights from San Francisco to Mobile return via Houston was on time. My flight back to  obile was even more horrible. First they couldn't find an airplane, the lady at the boarding ramp at SFO was very rude and not willing to help and wouldn't tell me her name. After arriving to Houston, I got put on a flight scheduled to leave hours later and then got delayed again for aircraft maintenance! And again the staff was rude. This was my first flight with United Airlines and will probably be my last. I am scheduled to be at work at the hospital in 5hrs and I have not had sleep from being stuck out of state at airports.",-1
2017-04-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Florence via Frankfurt,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,Service is horrible,False,"  Houston to Frankfurt. I was a frequent flyer with Continental that was forced to go with United after the merge. Service is horrible at United from booking to flight to baggage handling. My mother died in January and I had the rudest service when I tried to make an emergency trip to go to the funeral. It cost me a fortune. I was bumped to the cheapest flight, foreign airlines, worst seat. They lost my baggage, could not upgrade. No understanding at all, everybody was so rude. It is impossible to fly with United, fee for everything, penalty for any change completely disgusting. The only reason we keep flying with them is because they have a monopoly on the Houston market.",-1
2017-04-24,0.3,Business,Economy Class,New York Laguardia to Denver,1.0,1.0,2.0,,4.0,1.0,2,poor experience with United,False,"  New York LaGuardia to Denver. Another poor experience with United. Shabby plane with very uncomfortable seats, tortoise like speed of service (why can Southwest serve drinks twice as fast?) and then the inevitable delays. Having been on 3 or 4 domestic flights this trip it seems at least part of United's problem is the endemic lack of capacity at key US airports like LGA. Every time delays taking off, delays finding a gate on arrival. All very frustrating. I thought the UK was bad at infrastructure with LHR running at 99.9% capacity but at least there are only delays there when there's a specific problem. At US airports it seems routine. All pretty unbelievable really - I ended up pining for the ruthless efficiency of easyJet and Ryanair back home which I never thought possible.",-1
2017-04-24,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Costa Rica to Boston via Houston,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,will absolutely never travel United again,False," Costa Rica to Boston via Houston with United. First my flight from Costa Rica to Houston is delayed 2 hours and 50 mins. Then slowly turns into a 7 hours delay. My connecting flight in Houston departs at 3:52. After telling the flight attendant I have a flight right after we board and begging to be let off early he tells me I'm not the only one. Then after my flights gets into Houston at 3 and I run through the entire airport, which is not small, and took a train. Go through customs, immigration, re-checking bags and all that. I finally see the gate at 3:42 and me and 2 other women watch them close the gate and tell us they gave our seats away. Even though we have 10 mins till departure. Staff at the gate wouldn't speak to us. The next flight is 5 hours later. No mention of anything being their fault. I will absolutely never travel United Airlines again.",-1
2017-04-21,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Grand Junction to LaGuardia via Denver,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2,no way she could waive this fee,False,"  I have just had a very frustrating experience with United Airlines. I bought two tickets for NY, mine with $, my wife's with miles + dollars both using my United branded VISA card. I called and asked the record to be combined so that she would also get her first bag free and was told by the agent that this was accomplished. However, when I went to check-in tonight I discovered that this was not done. After an hour on hold, I spoke to a supervisor who told me that this couldn't be accomplished and that my wife would have to pay a fee for her first bag! The supervisor told me there was no way she could waive this fee. This seems like a bait and switch operation for both United and Chase VISA. A poor way to treat a frequent flyer and high dollar user of the United branded VISA card. One more example of why many people, now including me will try to avoid United.",-1
2017-04-21,1.0,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Edmonton,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,over-delivered today on my flight,False, Houston to Edmonton with United. Flight attendant was wonderful. I needed to charge my phone and he went above and beyond in helping me. Asked us several times if we needed water or another drink. I love this airline! And the seats are always nicer and comfy than a few other airlines. I fly 6-8 times a week and I really appreciate how they over-delivered today on my flight.,1
2017-04-21,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Tampa,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,5,my experiences have always been positive,False," This United flight was the return part of a same-day trip Washington to Tampa return. Both flights were boarded with good discipline, pushed-back early, and arrived ahead of schedule. The service in economy was minimal, but there was a normal beverage offering: soft drinks for free and alcoholic beverages for a reasonable charge. I reserved and received the exit row window seat, which is my favorite. The personal device service onboard is a step forward, but the flight map included is much inferior to the one Lufthansa offers. As a Star Alliance Gold, I took the hike over to the B concourse to enjoy the Lufthansa Senator Lounge, which was surprisingly uncrowded. These last few weeks have been a trial-by-fire for United Airlines. Many frequent flyers have been outraged by egregious onboard errors, but my experiences with United have always been positive. I have several trips with them planned for next month, and I hope and expect that these flights will go smoothly as well.",1
2017-04-20,0.3,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Palm Springs to Cork via Chicago and Paris,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,2,be using American from now on,False,"  I fly to Ireland twice a year now and use either United or American. This is the first time I flew in a 767. I was most interested in the new United Polaris Business class. It may be different on the larger planes, however, on this aircraft the cabin was no different and was not new. The food from the new ""chef"" was the worst I've ever had in business class on any airline out of the 4 or 5 airlines I've traveled on in Business class. Having read the glorious PR about their new ""chef,"" I was really looking forward to the food. I wouldn't serve it in Economy and they ran out of the Chicken dish by the time they got to me. The fish (my reluctant second choice) was over cooked and dry. The green noodles were stuck together on the bottom where I assume they were overheated. On the flight from Palm Springs to Chicago, I was trapped in Economy since there was no business class on that plane. I sat in the 3rd row and the attendant announced they were out of the cheese plate and cheese burger to the row in front of me. I flew two days after the huge PR disaster, dragging a customer off the plane kicking and screaming. It seems that is not the only problem. This airline is not run well. When the poor attendant in Business class announced to me they were out of the chicken dish I ordered, I was a bit upset and she apologized and said it had been a rough couple of days. My other complaint is an ongoing problem that everyone I know is dealing with. They keep advertising their frequent flyer program but when you actually try to get a business class seat, it is impossible most of the time. As an exercise recently, I tried to get a seat for the rest of the year--8 months!--and there were two flights in those 8 months that I could get a business class seat flying from Palm Springs to Cork, Ireland, and of course that only applies to the long flight, not the two short flights on either end which must be economy. I tried last August to book Business class seats both ways on this current trip and there were no seats available on the return flight--though online it shows 27 available seats in Business class. I'll be using American from now on.",-1
2017-04-20,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Houston to Amsterdam,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2,new Polaris class far from great,False,"  Houston to Amsterdam with United. Flight attendants were in a rush to serve dinner on this 8 hour flight. No smiles - just get it served and get it picked up. Since I spent 250,000 if my hard earned points to fly business on my first trip to Europe since 1986 I was anticipating a bit of a happier mood throughout the business cabin. Also, this was the vaunted new Polaris class which in my opinion was far from great. At 6'4"" I should have been able to stretch out flat, but because of the shape of the pods that could not happen. The seat was also very uncomfortable. This was some of the worst food I have ever been served on United. Thank goodness our flight back was on Air Canada which was a wonderful experience. Rest assured my new travel card will be Bank of America and where I not only earn more millage than with my current Chase card but also will not be stuck flying United again.",-1
2017-04-20,0.2,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Chicago O'Hare,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2,a dirty and run-down plane,False,"  These 757-300s are over 15 years old and should not still be flying. If you are sitting in the back, expect it to take at least 15-20 minutes to deplane. The outbound (BOS-ORD) plane, N57870, had no TVs. It was just overall a dirty and run-down plane. The return (ORD-BOS) plane, N75858, did have TVs. When I'm on a plane that has TVs, I usually watch a movie on my iPad and turn the TV to the map channel. It took almost 20 minutes for me to find the map, then while we were something like 15th in line for takeoff (because that's just how things happen at O'Hare), the screen told me that my ""free preview"" of DirecTV was up and I had to pay to continue using the TV for anything, including the map. Shortly after takeoff, I opened the movie on my iPad and saw that I had forgotten to rent the movie I wanted to watch (and I admit that this was on me). I decided to watch a movie on the seatback TV and just pay the fee. However, they didn't seem to want my money even when I was desperately throwing it at them. The credit card reader didn't work no matter how many different ways I swiped my card. Eventually, I paid for an hour of free internet on my phone and transferred it to my iPad. The flight was halfway through at this point. I fly this route (BOS-ORD and back) several times a year to visit family. American Airlines is absolutely awful, and the most ironic thing is that we booked with United out of spite for American. Both American and United are horrible, so no matter how early in the morning their flights to Chicago are, JetBlue, here I come!",-1
2017-04-20,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Maui to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,I won't recommend this flight,False,"  This was my first time traveling with United Airlines, however it was frustrating. I was travelling with my family from Los Angeles to Maui which was a 6 hour flight. The services from the check point to the flight attendant was very bad. There was not a friendly person in the flight crew.  We had booked the ticket 10 months ago and had payed high price for it, but still got the worst seat when flighing to and fro. One time we were assigned the last row seat next to the toilet and when came back they give the seat next to exit by the wing. Both the seats could not be adjusted. I don't understand how they assign seat? I had self checked 24 hours go, but I still got the worst seat. After paying a high price ticket they wanted an other 75$ if I wanted a better seat. I have travelled in several airlines but United airlines is the worst. I won't recommend this flight to anyone.",-1
2017-04-18,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santiago to Newark,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,were separated by 23 rows,False,"  Returning home from a family trip to Santiago (Dominican Republic) to Newark, I became very angry because having chosen our 4 seats together at time of purchase like I always have, we were separated by 23 rows. Having a 2 year old daughter and a 6 year old son this is sad. On top of that sitting on the last row with my daughter, I sent my wife and son on row 15 two lunches with the flight attendant, which never got to them. Food was given to someone else. Got out of the plane after landing to find out that they had no food the whole flight. I don't think we will choose United Airlines in the future.",-1
2017-04-13,0.1,Business,First Class,Boston to San Francisco,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,every time manages to underwhelm,False,"  It started not too bad with the lady at the check-in being friendlier than expected despite the check-in facilities being rather uninviting. Next was the surprise that there's no lounge access for First Class passengers unless you're a frequent traveler. Yes, first world problem but with service-oriented airlines that'd be a ""no go"". Everything from boarding to disembarking goes by ""not yelling is already friendly enough"". Old 757 aircraft (not unexpected with United). Inflight entertainment screens the size of my phone and no on demand program. The real disaster though was the general condition of the aircraft. It was filthy. My personal highlight was the tray table. This one has not been cleaned in a long time. Although the flight wasn't bumpy, the coffee came in a mug that was clearly spilled over, but hey, who cares. Seated in row 1 as well gave me the pleasure of a free foot bath as obviously either the galley or the bathroom on the other side of the wall had a leak. Luckily it was only water soaking the carpet, my bag and my shoes. Here as well just shrugging shoulders when I asked for help. I really travel a lot around the world but there's no other airline that every time manages to underwhelm. United is a disgrace for Star Alliance who normally offers a premium product (LH, TG, LX, SQ, OZ and so on). After several disappointments and the latest incidents neither me nor anyone of my colleagues will consider United again.",-1
2017-04-13,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Aspen,2.0,,5.0,,,1.0,3,genuinely to not care a wit,False,"  So not helpful and illogical. Showing up at the Aspen terminal for a flight to LAX, there were low clouds/ground fog that prevented the incoming aircraft from landing. Certainly not United's fault. Thus, this plane - intended to carry us to LAX - was diverted to the nearby, out-of-the-weather airport in Grand Junction. Those passengers were then bused up to ASE. Our complaint is that our flight group wasn't offered a ""return"" trip on that bus down to where the plane was residing (and wound up spending the night on the tarmac) at Grand Junction Reg Airport. No, we were all told - in spite of the inclement weather with promise of more to come - to ""come back early tomorrow morning; that plane will surely be able to get in here for you."" Doubting this, we nonetheless secured an (expensive) one night unplanned additional stay nearby, awoke at 3:30 am Sunday, and got a ride back down to the still socked-in airport. Our intended plane went ahead and left Grand Junction not to come get us (it couldn't), but to head off to parts unknown. The weather was such that no plane wasn't getting in and the bus, was long gone. The bus that could have easily transported our departing group down to the plane in its nearby diverted location the day before. Frustration with the United gate agents at ASE led us, and several others, to rent cars (no easy task with such a limited inventory available at a small airport), and drive one-way to Los Angeles. Thank you so much, Hertz! 14 hours and $500.00 later (between the +1 night and rental car), United was out of our hair. The United gate agents seemed quite genuinely to not care a wit about the departing passenger's situations and needs. United bused the newly arriving folks in from the ""detour airport"", allowing that bus to subsequently dead-head off to who knows where. Why the devil wouldn't they get us out of the weather-plagued ASE location (which closes at night - no sleeping at the airport here, fyi) down to the plane. Our plane. Just sitting there. Why indeed.",-1
2017-04-11,0.4,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to San Diego via Chicago,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,,5.0,2,isn't the worst airline in the world,False,"  Flew from Warsaw to Frankfurt with LOT Polish Airlines and then to San Diego with United, with a transfer in O'Hare. Generally not a very pleasant experience. The aircraft was old and you could feel it - seats were almost broken, my screen of the entertainment system was broken as well (it recognised touch on the right part of the screen but not on the left part). Also the headphones were broken. Cabin crew was very welcoming and friendly, on the other hand. As for food, it was not so great but I've eaten worse. We started-off late from Frankfurt and I was a little worried because my transfer in Chicago was tight so it was a huge relief when the captain informed us we landed on time in O'Hare. Too early! It turned out the airport didn't have a gate ready for us and we were standing 45 minutes on landing field. Then my transfer become really tight and I literally had to run through the entire O'Hare. Fortunately, the aircraft to San Diego was waiting for me as they knew flight from Frankfurt had issues with the gate. My baggage didn't make it on time to the San Diego flight but United sent it over to my hotel a day later. Overall, compared to Lufthansa with which I was returning, United was an average experience at best. It definitely isn't the worst airline in the world.",1
2017-04-10,0.5,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,EWR to LHR,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3,smiling didn't seem like an option,False,"  Newark to London. My first impression when checking in the staff seemed friendly but pushed for time meaning the service was quickly over, although it was fast it came across rude when they would hurry me and my travelling friends along. When boarding the aircraft we were welcomed by a lovely set of crew that were happy to point us in the direction of our seats, I was confused as to why there were not any other crew members in the centre of the aircraft welcoming us, like on other airlines I have flown with, all the flight attendants seemed to be in the back galley chatting amongst each other. After takeoff the flight attendants started the service offering drinks, smiling didn't seem like an option for many of the crew I was confused as I noticed across the middle seating that the other crew members were bright and cheerful. The inflight meal was rather poor, I had two options one that I was told was pasta and the other chicken, that's about as much information that I was given so I chose the chicken -  it was hardly chicken when there was about four smaller pieces of chicken inside and some bread and a side dish the cheese sauce was vile as it was getting cold by the time the cart had reached me. During the flight two medical emergencies came up with the group I was traveling with, the flight attendants were quick to react and made sure that both passengers where okay. They asked for any medical professionals to step forward and the matter was resolved within around an hour after departure when a travelling nurse was able to help. I think the inflight entertainment system was really great to occupy those who couldn't sleep. Before landing the flight attendants brought out breakfast, this was disappointing because there was so little.",1
2017-04-07,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Houston to Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,customer service has proven to be unfriendly,False,"  Flew United Airlines from Houston to Los Angeles. The United customer service has proven to be unfriendly. I have received better support from ex continental employees than those of United and they are getting harder to locate as the new hires take on the persona of the sardine flight company that overlooks all of its flights. In calling to try and find a set of seats that we could sit together the only seats that they could find were at row 37 where we were split between row 8 and 25 previously. They also then wanted over 100 dollars to upgrade one seat where I was offered nothing for moving backwards in seating. They also offer no support for the consumer nor do they recognize those that have traveled most of their adult life, if it were not for all of the continental lifetime miles I would chose an alternative airline company to fly and if Alaska Airlines had a better connection out of Houston it would probably be the best of those I have flown recently.",-1

United is my personal preferred carrier. EWR to Hong Kong serviced by some of the most aged and bitter UA personnel. Locally based HK crew HKG-SIN delivered exceptional service. SIN-SFO on a brand new aircraft (787-9) which seemed above average as UA competes with SQ. 777-300 SFO-EWR delivered a great product. Avoid EWR long-haul, especially to Asia. It's clear that tenured FAs based in EWR are lacking and should be promptly retired.",1
2017-04-05,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,Newark to Las Vegas,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,always rude and abrupt,False,"  Due to fly from Newark to Las Vegas. I have never been on a United flight that departed or arrived on time. The majority of United Airlines employees are rude and act as though we the customers should be grateful that we are allowed to be in their presence. Bags have been sent to different states, or sent to different baggage claim #, without telling us, then when we inquire, the answer is never polite or helpful. It is always rude and abrupt, like we are interrupting their day. The last time, my husband's bag was supposed to be at a certain carousel, he waited for over 45 minutes while an employee ""looked for it"", then a completely different employee brought it to him and said it was on a different carousel, #9 in fact, and ""didn't everyone know that carousal #9 is where to look for missing bags?"" There was even a woman behind him, with an infant in her arms, whose bag was sent to a different state altogether and was told she could either wait a few hours in the airport (the infant presumably) or it would be delivered to her the next day, but that she would have to be there at her home to sign for it. When she asked what time would it be delivered, they honestly said ""sometime."" Seriously. The woman explained that she needed a more concrete timeframe, so the employee replied with ""sometime before 5 or 6 pm."" I am now sitting in the airport, waiting on yet another delayed United flight, one that says the plane has been here since 5 am, and so we should be on-time, as our flight is scheduled to leave just before 10.30. Unfortunately, and rather not surprisingly, that plane is now being ""changed"" and my flight is ""at least 45 minutes delayed."" United is hands down the worst airline, with the worst customer service - you can't even call someone - and certainly not worth the price. I will be paying extra in the future to just to avoid flying United. In fact, I just booked a Delta flight and paid $20 more for it and I feel so much better knowing I at least have a chance of having an nice experience and being treated well in the process.",-1
2017-04-03,0.1,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Cabos to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,zero care or concerns,False," I booked 2 tickets from Los Cabos to Newark in Business class. Ten minutes before flight boarded I was notified that there was a broken seat 4B in business class and one person in my party needed to be bumped to coach. This seat was broken prior to leaving Newark to SJD. I should have been notified prior to going to the airport so I could have found alternative flights in business class. I should have even been told when I checked in at the airport. There should be better communications with passenger if they are going to get bumped and not tell them 10 minutes before boarding. Furthermore I thought it was proper for an airline to ask for volunteers for compensation and not just be bumped which never occurred. United Airlines customer service is horrible and have zero care or concerns for passengers and I fly every other week, always in business or first class. I will only fly Delta and American Airlines in the future. United Airlines repeated complete disregard for passengers is clearly apparent and I will never put myself in this situation again. As well as long flight with uncomfortable seats, no pillows or blankets.",-1
2017-04-02,0.9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Birmingham to Los Angeles via Newark,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,needs to roll out its new winning product,False," Birmingham to Los Angeles via Newark. Normally to get through a flight with a US based carrier by telling my self to lower expectations. However, with United's new Polaris Business class on the BHX to EWR leg those days are over. Polaris is a product that is truly up to international standards. Whilst the 757 seating is the same as before the whole soft product is a massive improvement. From the time you reach your seat with its pile of Saks Fifth Avenue bedding topped by a cuddly polar bear teddy, to disembarkation I felt looked after. A brochure explaining the product including the menu was handed out as was an excellent amenity kit. Tasty food well presented with lots of little touches. I would highly recommend it. The ratings are based on this leg. Unfortunately the success of Polaris just went to show how far behind the P.S. business class with the same flat bed seating, which was on the EWR to LAX leg, was. No amenity kit, limited bedding, single sheet menu, adequate but not exceptional cabin staff. I lowered my expectations and it was alright. United needs to roll out its new winning product into its longer domestic routes.",1
2017-04-02,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Chicago,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1,Will not fly United again,False,"  Cancun to Chicago. Flight was overbooked! We had tickets but didn't get seats (all seats were taken). Purchased tickets several months in advance. Gate crew couldn't care less and had to put my wife on a later flight (2 hours later) while the rest of us (1 adult and 2 kids) had to travel separately. Had to arrange another transportation from the airport and be late for the planned event. Looks like consumer fraud, selling tickets for flight and not providing service.

Quality of a low cost carrier for a regular price. We were on a 6 hour international flight (to West Coast Mexico) and they didn't even offer a free meal. Only overpriced sandwiches to buy. And on our way back the only thing they offered for purchase was Pringles and some other chips. Unbelievable! Very uncomfortable, very little leg room, no screens on the back of the seat in front of you. They suggested that we download their app to have some entertainment on our own electronic devices, but didn't offer headphones! I felt like they were mocking us. The pilot told us there's free WiFi on board, but it wasn't there! No pillows, no blankets. Extremely slow service. We were in the back of the plane, they had only one group of flight attendants serving everyone, so we had to wait for two hours to get something to drink. Very unpleasant experience",-1
2017-04-02,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Hartford to Pittsburgh,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,absolute worst airline,False,  Hartford to Pittsburgh. The absolute worst airline you can possibly try and take. Drove to the airport at 5 am just to tell me that the $600 seats I purchased were OS. They literally waited until I was boarding to inform me of this! How does that make any sense at all. If you don't have the tickets don't sell them. To top it off they tell me they're not sure if they will be able to refund them. 5 days later after I called highly upset they magically get refunded back to me. A week later I'm in a pinch and give them a chance to redeem themselves. Flight gets delayed which is fine but they told everyone it would be delayed 25 minutes. The flight left 1.5 hours later. Nobody on the flight could make their connecting flights and they offered nothing for us! The staff didn't even care that people were upset and now most likely had to sleep in DC they just continued to take their good Ole time with everything. Can't wait to land and see kind of BS they offer me for causing me to now miss work and my family tomorrow.  If you have a choice between horseback and United Airlines choose horseback you'll get their faster and have the actual service you paid for.

2017-04-01,0.2,Business,Premium Economy,San Francisco to New Orleans,2.0,,2.0,1.0,,2.0,2,nickle and dime you for every inch,False,"  Flew United Airlines from San Francisco to New Orleans. I paid $242.00 for economy plus, thinking that like other Airlines, the economy plus package would include priority boarding. It includes 6 inches of leg room and a beverage. $242 for 6 inches of leg room and a beverage. United is the worst, greediest airline I have flown, they nickle and dime you for every inch. I will never fly this airline again.",-1
2017-03-30,0.2,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Washington to Zurich,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1,will try to avoid them next time,False,"  Washington to Zurich in Premium Economy, Seat 28B, an exit row. I am not sure the extra price of more than USD219 is really justified. Okay, you have plenty of legroom but you should be aware that the proximity of the Economy cabin lavatories means that you will have people tumbling over your legs the whole night. Apart from that the seat is lacking any cushioning (maybe because it is so worn after 16 years of service) so it becomes a pain after a while. And then you need to accept that all that premium eco thing does not buy you any better food service that is - compared with other airlines - simply really poor. Not that it tastes bad but the amount of food you receive is simply poor. Imagine getting a croissant in the morning coming along with a micro-sized jam pack but no butter. Imagine asking for a glass of wine >and< a glass or water and you will only have the choice between one of the two. All in all pretty disappointing, will try to avoid them next time.",-1
2017-03-30,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Spokane,1.0,,4.0,,,1.0,2,one of the most miserable flights,False,"  Denver to Spokane. This was one of the most miserable flights I've ever had. We selected a seat in the middle of the plane yet when we arrived they saw fit to place us on the last row. I'm 5'9"", my daughter is 5'11"", and my fiancé is 6'1"". We all had to turn sideways to fit. I could not reach my bag under the seat where I brought a magazine to read. Could not lower the tray table because it was too close. It was miserable!",-1
2017-03-28,0.2,Business,Business Class,Beijing to Boston via San Francisco,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3,greed trumps customer service,False,"  Flew UA business class Boston to Beijing in September 2016. Outbound was via Chicago, with a short [<2hrs] connection via Chicago scheduled on return. Given that my return time to Boston had become critical, staff at ORD suggested paying fee [$450] to return via San Francisco the day prior, which I then did. Beijing  to San Francisco leg was delayed departing, and arrived at SFO gate with 50 mins before scheduled SFO-BOS leg. I made it to gate but was informed that my itinerary [in First] had been switched, to a coach seat 4hrs later. At this point, UA were still offering first class seats for sale [including mine] on both the original SFO-BOS leg and also the later SFO-BOS flight.  This generated some amusement from the UA baggage handlers and gate staff which was at best disrespectful. After 30 days back and forth they refunded the class difference sum [$220 from a total of >$3400] but refused to refund change fees or offer explanation regarding selling on available seats [including mine] or offering a First class seat option [which I had paid for]. As a result, this was my last ever UA flight. I have flown BOS-PEK and BOS-LHR eight times since this incident with other carriers and have been rewarded with premium level service in the air and on the ground. It would seem that corporate greed trumps customer service even on business/first at UA so this makes it a non-starter for corporate travel where relationships and dependability matter the utmost.",-1
2017-03-26,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Charleston,1.0,,3.0,,,4.0,1,avoid United whenever possible,False,"  On my return flight from Charleston to Newark United told me that even though I purchased a ticket three months ago, they overbooked the flight and if no one agrees to book off I would be bumped off of my flight. That's what happened so instead of having a direct flight home arriving at 6pm I now had to make a connection in DC and get in at 11:30pm. If buying a ticket doesn't assure you of a seat, how can you ever be sure getting to your destination in a timely fashion?? Will avoid United whenever possible.",-1
2017-03-25,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Shanghai via San Francisco,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,This is a horrible experience,False,"  This is a horrible experience. My mother-in-law travel with United from Denver to Shanghai via San Francisco. The flight was supposed to depart at 10:50AM. However, it delayed to 2PM due to mechanic issues. What is more annoying is that they postpone the flight by every half hour, meaning that they said it would delayed to 11:xx. When it was getting closer to the delayed time, they delay again to 12:xx. Again, when it was almost 12:xx, they delay it to 1:xx. Several times!  The most annoying thing is that they didn't even know when it could fly, and they came to ask your decision, if you wanted to fly today, or tomorrow! OK, if it was myself, I could handle it. But the traveller was a 72-year-old, non-English speaker. Because of this delay, she missed her second flight from SFO to Shanghai. She definitely needed assistance in SFO, either logde into an hotel or some place for rest. When I call United's customer service (headquarter), they couldn't connect me to their branch in SFO. My mother-in-law had to find the United counter by herself. When I asked what to do with her checked-in luggages. They said my mother-in-law needed to picked it up from carousel and re-check it! Isn't it you messed up the trip.  In the past 2 years, UA has delayed my flight for at least 3 out of 5 times for mechanic issues. My advice is: stay away from UA and save your time.",-1
2017-03-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Milwaukee to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,absolutely ridiculous,False,"  Every time I fly United I am delayed. Better yet, my final destination to Dayton, Ohio was delayed hours and coincidentally a direct flight to Cleveland was boarding right next to my delayed flight. In order to make my meeting on time, flying to Cleveland would have enabled me to make that happen. United wouldn't allow me to change my flight unless I paid $300, even though the flight to Cleveland wasn't full. Absolutely ridiculous. When Southwest has delays they take care of their customers with no penalty. United is horrible.",-1
2017-03-20,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Columbus to Washington,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,No instructions were provided,False,"  Columbus to Washington. Boarded the plane at 6:00 am, supposed to depart at 6:20, they had us sitting until 7:00 then told us to leave the plane for mechanical problem. No instructions were provided of what to do next, they didn't get another plane so passengers were scrambling to find an alternative on their own. Staff was rude, I asked to take me to a different destination to catch my international flight, they refused, I asked for my baggage and took them an hour to get it back. I asked for a refund of what I paid for the baggage they said they do not do refunds in the airport.",-1
2017-03-18,0.2,Business,Premium Economy,Washington to Zurich,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2,quality of service is mediocre,False,"  Washington to Zurich. Being a night flight, I was trying to upgrade to Business Class using Miles & More miles. As Star Alliance Gold holder, I was very surprised to learn, that United gives zero priority to Star Alliance members outside of their own MileagePlus program. There was no way I could be put onto the upgrade wait list, although I had an up-gradable Economy ticket (B-Ticket). It seems United only allows their own MileagePlus holders to be put on wait list. For me this was very frustrating, as there were a couple of people who were upgraded to Business on the subjected flight. I honestly don't understand why United is even a member of Star Alliance if they don't treat all Star Alliance program holders equally. On top of that, the quality of service is mediocre and I cannot recommend United as carrier.",-1
2017-03-17,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hawaii to Austin via Los Angeles,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,seats are ridiculously narrow,False,"  I will never choose to fly United Airlines again. Just plain stupid that they would book such a small, uncomfortable plane for such a long flight (Maui to Los Angeles). Seats are ridiculously narrow with no leg room, air vents barely blew out any cool air. Oh yes, and they so generously served us a tiny packet of mixed pretzel / nuts for a 5-hour flight. This airline is cheap and not customer-service oriented. The outgoing flight was not any better. WiFi plugs did not work and no TV screens on such a long, boring flight. Flight attendants seemed put-out at the slightest request. I'm really dreading the last leg of this flight.",-1
2017-03-17,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Burlington to Santo Domingo via Newark,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,2,"United, you've lost a customer",False,"  Two nights in a row, March 1st/2nd United Airlines cancelled our 6:00 AM flight from Burlington to connect in Newark to an 8:40 AM flight to Santo Domingo because of ""crew issues"". On the second night we rented a car in Burlington and drove to Newark to make the 8:40 flight. The price of the rental and the loss of our first night's missed lodging in Santo Domingo was over $300. United reimbursed us $175 total for our two tickets on the the Burlington to Newark leg and offered 2 x $150 flight vouchers (which, after a minimum $15/ticket ticket servicing fee reduced the value to at best $135 each). The hassle, aggravation and lost vacation time were truly a disappointment. United's recompense was minimal. I've been a United mileage plus member for years. I've used my Chase Mileage Plus Visa card as my primary credit card. No longer. United, you've lost a customer.",-1
2017-03-13,0.8,Business,First Class,San Francisco to Lincoln via Denver,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,the service was very good indeed,False,"  
After all the poor reviews I had some trepidation flying United within the United States. However all was pretty fine. My flight from San Francisco to Denver was delayed as the aircraft comes in from Auckland before proceeding to Denver. Once on-board the service was very good indeed and very personal and pleasant. First Class fares in the US are not much more (if at all) than many economy fares in Australia so I suspect economy/coach passengers in the US on United have little to complain about - there is no such thing as a free lunch! The United Club before boarding was fine except the food offerings were not so good. Picking up a boarding pass coming in from an international flight was not so good either - very slack staff, However, once on board, I really enjoyed being able to chat to the flight crew on boarding and afterwards as well as the good wine. The United DBA express onwards to Lincoln was fine, even in economy. I would happily fly United again..",1
2017-03-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Houston to Monterrey,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1,do not lie to your clients,False,"  They forgot our bags in Houston. We were connecting in Monterrey to Hermosillo. My review is for their staff at the Monterrey airport. Since it was an international flight, we need to pass our bags for customs. We asked for help at Monterrey airport and their staff were lying. We were told our bags will be at our final destination. Once we arrived to Hemrosillo, we found out they forgot our bags in Houston. I understand accidents happen but do not lie to your clients.",-1
2017-03-12,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Beijing to San Francisco,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2,traditional bad United food,False,"  Beijing to San Francisco. The airplane was an old Boeing 747 not adapted to new onboard entertainment technology so you had just two options: you could either try to follow a movie through one of those old screens that was just a meter away to the left from my seat or you could watched though your laptop. Unfortunately, they forgot to tell that you needed to download a plug in prior to board so the option was useless. You had an additional option: purchasing wifi to download it. I did it, but the plug in never worked and no-one seemed to know how to fix it, of course. So I spent my flight watching FB (of course, when you leave China). The flight was packed with Chinese families that don't seem eager to educate their children to live with other people. I had to ask for help because a child was yelling and playing with his father endlessly. The hostess was successful in stoping the yelling but couldn't avoid the family speaking all the way to San Francisco. The food is the traditional bad United food, so don't waste your time expecting something better.",1
2017-03-12,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Aguadilla to Newark,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,they have let things slide,False,"  Flew United Airlines from Aguadilla to Newark. Worst experience ever. Coming in there was no air conditioning, I literally roasted four hours. Coming back I thought I would miss my flight. The site said my flight left at 3am. I got to the airport at 1.15am, the attendant told me my flight was boarding because it was to leave at 2am so I ran so I wouldn't miss my flight to be told it was delayed to 4am. They are disorganized and have let things slide. I hope I never have to use them again.",-1
2017-03-10,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Burlington to Chicago,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,involuntarily kicked off,False,"  Burlington to Chicago. My family of 4 got involuntarily kicked off due to ""weight restriction"" of the flight. Since no one volunteered, we got chosen because of our ""ticket class"". So at 530pm at night with no alternative in sight, United Airlines decided to kick off a 7 year old and 13 year old due to weight restricted flight. When we got to our connecting city, Newark, person in customer service at first refused to give us the hotel voucher because he didn't want to listen to the story and promises united made in Vermont. He didn't listen until my husband came over to have the conversation.",-1
2017-03-07,0.4,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Singapore,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2,not good if you want to sleep,False,"  United Airlines San Francisco to Singapore flight was run by a very senior Continental crew with a flight time of 16.5  hours. I was given access to the United First Class lounge which was located closer to the boarding area of the flight. The Business Class section was 2x2x2 seating, causing window passengers to cross over their seat mates. The service was excellent and the food and wines were good, however, I did not get my first choice, fish. So much for ordering the white wine and ending up with beef. My main complaint was that the fasten seatbelt sign came on at least 12 times during the flight and it was a smooth flight. Several times one little bump would cause the fasten seatbelt sign to appear, which would trigger the recorded announcement, ""Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. For your safety and for those around you, please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt."" A flight attendant would then do the message in Chinese. The television monitors (many which were turned off) would all turn back on and with a bright white background with the message a special announcement is in progress. This certainly lit up the entire cabin. I would strongly recommend that if you fly on United's 787 aircraft, you bring good earplugs and eye shades. In short, United is not a good airline if you want to sleep on the flight. This was a smooth flight and the flight attendants were never asked to sit down but I was woke up many times during the flight. Singapore Airlines does this same flight using an A350, which offers more room in economy and 1x2x1 seating in Business Class.",-1
2017-03-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta cana to Newark,2.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline ever,False,"  Punta Cana to Newark. Worst airline ever! They canceled our 3rd March flight at 10:00pm due to not having a pilot (due to reaching their max hours for the day) after we were already boarded. The flight was already delayed to top it off. The reps at the airport were rude and refused to help. I called the United customer service number and they hung up on me. Finally after getting someone on the line supposedly the only flight they had was for us to leave at 3 in the afternoon on 4 March with getting us to Des Moines after 9 PM! As one gentleman (who was on a different flight but his flight got canceled for the same reason) put it ""They had all damn day to crunch the damn numbers"" and at 10 PM they figured this out. On top of this we got no hotel! We had to sleep in the airport. They had us running all over the airport to talk to their reps and fetch our luggage. In the end Delta had a flight that left Newark today at 6:55am est and had us home at 9:30am Cst. It was very frustrating to be treated like we are nothing and then got a flight with Delta and were treated very well.",-1

United Airlines is a disaster and has been for years. On time departures are unheard of. Very poor systems and customer service. I would love to say that I would never fly on them again, but due to the monopoly they have to most destinations in the country this is not a realistic option. I am literally in United Hell, with no end in sight. Avoid this airline at all costs if possible.",-1

Not an easy and quick check-in. Plane looked aged, nice leg room space, good inflight entertainment and very good Wi-Fi and internet connection at a reasonable price (for the entire flight), terrible blankets. Very nice and gentle cabin crew. Food wasn´t poor quality and quantity for a flight of 14h30.",-1

Our first United flight out of Chicago we had to deboard due to mechanical errors and missed our connection, we lost a day of our vacation and we're compensated nothing but a meal voucher and hotel room for the night. On our return through Chicago we boarded the plane and waited, again due to mechanical errors. We sat on the plane for another 50 minutes before being told to deplane. All these mechanical errors definitely make me very uncomfortable with the safety of this airline. I will never fly United Airlines again.",-1
2017-02-28,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAS to RDU via ORD,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4,Glad to see snacks back,False,"  Las Vegas to Raleigh Durham via Chicago. On-time both flights. Good seat pitch, as the seats are slightly thinner. Glad to see that snacks are back on United. Loved the Stroopwafels! Wonderful service, flight attendants were kind. The only complaint is with the seat recline, which was minimal and slightly uncomfortable to sleep in. So if you're flying a red-eye and want some sleep, take a window seat - makes a huge difference, especially on a Boeing 737.",1

If you can avoid this airline please do at all costs. The people working in the kiosk check in areas are the most rude, unhelpful people on this planet of ours. I don't know where United finds these staff, but they are the most incompetent I have ever dealt with. I fly very often for business and I must say of all the airlines I deal with United is, without a doubt, the absolute worst.",-1
2017-02-26,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Aspen to New York via Denver,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,disappointing way to treat customers,False,"  Aspen to New York via Denver. A family of 4 we were scheduled to leave Aspen airport 26th February at 7am. 5.5 hours before leaving, the flight was reported to leave on time. We arrived to the airport, checked in only 6 am at the gate we get to know plane is delayed till 9:30. We were lied that they had no crew but the plane is here. Its only an hour later we get to know the real story that plane never landed night before in Aspen and went to Grand Junction and now will arrive to Aspen for 7 am flight. None of that was reported on United website or app until 7 am and we had to wake up little kids at 4am and sit for hours in the airport not to mention missing the connection etc. What a disappointing way to treat customers!",-1

A simple air wick will make all the difference in this plane. Literally it smells rotten this flight. The flight was also overbooked. Better to pay a little more money and avoid united airlines. When trying to get carry on bag into the plane, was informed by an operator that the cabins where full and had to a check the bag for 35$ which I paid gladly, but once I smelled this plane all my patience went to hell. Never flying United again.",-1
2017-02-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Tampa to San José del Cabo,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,consecutive horrible flights,False,"  Tampa to San José del Cabo via Houston. Never had such consecutive horrible flights with one company! Left 3 hours late from Tampa because of maintenance issues. Missed our connecting flight to Cabo and had to fly to Mexico City to board this Aeromexico flight and have mechanical issues and delayed again. It will be an extra 10 hours of being in airports - they made it seem like they were really doing us a favor by offering a hotel room if they couldn't find a new flight. But instead they gave the two of us $20 in food vouchers in case we got hungry. That seems like a great tradeoff for an all inclusive day at a resort where we were suppose to be, with my husbands customers! I can understand when weather causes isssues, but both of these were mechanical issues with the plane.",-1

United Airlines does not care about customer service. I arrived early to Denver and there was an earlier flight to Atlanta. I had no luggage, there was an earlier flight with open seats. For a couple of keystrokes and $75 I could go on the earlier flight. This change would have made me happy and most likely someone would have been happy to take my spot on the later flight. This would have been win-win win with United being the hero. Now you are defined by your greed. I hope the loss of my goodwill and many others was worth the $75 you did not get.",-1

We couldn't take off for 20 minutes because of equipment failure - understandable. We landed and spent 30 minutes trying to find a gate. Almost like they were surprised we showed up. Then we couldn't make it to our gate on time because they failed to notify the next gate because it 'arrived on time', which clearly it didn't. We arrived 5 minutes before our gate, they close it 10 minutes prior. But no worries, it's actually better business that they do these kinds of things.",-1
2017-02-15,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Munich,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,4,entertainment is also very lacking,False,"  The fact that I could avoid Frankfurt and fly directly from Houston to Munich is probably the best thing about this flight. The Boeing 767 is one of my favorite aircraft and it has a great interior and is well kept. The service was great, but the food was bad even by airline standards. I am probably one of the few people on this planet that enjoy airline food but this is simply not edible. For some reason their bread is called a 1234VR Brown Roll, I am not sure what it is and what horrible concoction of chemicals it inlcudes, but I cannot fathom why they would serve it to their guests. I miss the times when bread was just that bread, made with water, yeast and flour. The entertainment is a bit annoying as you are forced to view 2 commercials prior to any movies or TV episodes. The entertainment is also very lacking in general, the movies are very old as in HBO old. Nothing that is currently in the movies is shown.",1
2017-02-13,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Geneva to Denver,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,was horribly uncomfortable,False,  Geneva to Denver. Absolutely horrible. We flew United for an eight hour international flight to our home in Colorado. Seat cushion was not attached properly and was horribly uncomfortable. Seats were far too close together (compared with Air Canada and others) and uncomfortable. Seat screen malfunctioning (both seats in the row). Staff was unfriendly (presumably because of the unhappy passengers and poor quality of aircraft). Such a disgraceful airline. Clearly United doesn't care because this is just one of many poor reviews and the custom satisfaction rating is quite low. Choose another airline for a long flight.,-1

2017-02-11,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jackson Hole to Newark,,,,,,1.0,1,lack of common sense,False,"  United Airlines canceled the flight from Newark to Burlington because of aircraft mechanical problems. There are no more flights on any airline from Newark or La Guardia for 3 days. They refused to give a voucher for a rental car or a hotel. Instead gave us 20 dollars of food vouchers to use while we wait for a bus to be arranged. But no specific time or actual promise of this bus ever appearing. The food voucher is worthless as well because it's the middle of the night and nothing is open here. Also, after canceling several flights for random reasons they only had 4 people working the customer service counter and two of them got up and left while there was about 60 people waiting in line. Complete lack of common sense or caring about people.",-1

I was one of the last to board and had a window seat. The cabin crew took some time to realise that I have boarded but once they took notice, they quickly offered a menu for pre-flight drinks. The seat layout was the older Polaris product i.e. not all seats have direct access to the aisle. After take off, the crew came round to take orders for meals. The menu looked impressive but at least two of the meal options were not available which was disappointing. I had to go with my 2nd option but thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The service was attentive and pro-active with the crew doing rounds to ensure passengers' drinks are topped up, etc. I especially enjoyed the Sak's avenue blanket and large pillows. There were a thin blanket and small pillow available so passengers get to choose what works best.",1

I had to try 9 seat power outlets around me to finally find one that worked that I could charge my phone on. I bought an hour of internet for $8 and it worked for maybe 20 minutes. I flew from Chicago to Honolulu (9 hours) and they only gave us a cookie. Will not be flying United Airlines again.,-1

Flight was very full as there is only one flight a day and the previous nights flight had left about 13 people behind due to being late off another United Airlines flight. This was fine we all got a seat but then sat for about half an hour to an hour on the plane as we waited for people coming off another flight, then waited for their baggage which seemed to have got lost. This is quite a late flight, we boarded at almost 11 pm at night so everyone was tired including the FA's. They seemed to be all tired, grumpy and not very helpful at all. I asked for a vegetarian meal (which is part of the standard meals now) and they gave me a chicken one - they weren't listening. The captain was great and kept us up to date. They tried to sell the premium economy seats a few times while we were waiting which is a bit annoying as they gave the impression the flight was full and it got everyone in a bit of a panic, especially the people who had been hanging around all day having missed the flight the previous night. They gave us dinner, a snake and breakfast. I slept most of the flight but it was bumpy and I put this down to going over the Pacific.",-1

My flight was a 32hrs trip from Panama to Singapore with a transit at Houston and an ther transit at San Francisco. My partner and I couldn't get a seat next to each other except if we had paid extra for it. There was no food and no TV in the first two flights. In Houston we had only one hour and half transit, but we had to get our luggage, pass the immigration and get in again. It's been very stressful in 1h30 to do that. We arrive at the gate just on time before they close, and the company was giving / selling our place to other people! Lucky we get there on time because they would not have waited for us! Service was poor and we finally got food on the last flight San Francisco to Singapore. The food was pretty bad. When we arrive in Singapore we tryed to get cash out, and we couldn't because we've got charged twice on our account!",-1
2017-02-01,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,IAD to LHR,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,1,far behind most of the world,False,"  Washington to London Heathrow. A tatty and quite disgraceful ancient Boeing 757 for this transatlantic flight reminded me how far behind most of the world the US airlines are nowadays. Doesn't look like things will improve for either in the mid-term! I stuck with them for Star Alliance purposes, having flown out with Lufthansa - but what a big mistake. Staff at Dulles airport were brusque (if I'm honest they were just damn rude), boarding was very poor. Onboard, all I wanted was for the flight to end. A slop of a meal was served, but the worst part was gum chewing cabin staff who looked unbelievably scruffy, and 3 of them were literally bursting out of their uniforms everywhere. I love my trips to the USA and being there, but wow their airlines are stuck somewhere in the last century.",-1
2017-01-31,0.7,Solo Leisure,First Class,TPA to IAD,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,uneventful and satisfactory,False," This was a round trip, same-day flight from Tampa to Washington IAD and return with United Airlines. Both flights boarded with good discipline, pushed-back ahead of time, departed promptly, and arrived early - the outbound flight by 24 minutes and the return by 1 minute. As a Mileage Plus Gold, I was upgraded on both segments. Golds are a low priority for complimentary upgrades, but Saturdays offer a better chance than weekdays. The snack offered was meager but acceptable for a two hour flight. Beverage service was quite satisfactory. United now offers Prosecco in domestic first class. It's not champagne, but it represents a step forward for United. These flights were uneventful and satisfactory - a situation that doesn't often occasion reviews but represents almost the entirety of my experiences with United Airlines.",1
2017-01-30,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Melbourne,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,worst airline I have experienced,False,"  United Airlines is the worst airline I have experienced.  We were on a connecting flight Cancun to LAX to Melbourne. Arriving in LAX we collected our luggage to re check in, to then be told you have to now fly to Sydney because you will not make the Melbourne flight. The Sydney flight was 10 minutes later then the Melbourne one! We then had to sprint to the other side of the airport with all of our luggage. Thankfully we are capable of running as there would be no way less able, families or elderly would have got there in time! The Sydney flight was waiting for us, we boarded. My husband was at the front of the plane and I was right at the back. I had been a signed a seat that was already taken 39E (written on my boarding pass) I approached the hostess to ask for some direction/ help, which to then I seemed to be a bother to her. I was then told that I was wrong and my seat is 40E. This seat was already taken as well! I was then finally given an empty seat.. Throughout the flight the hostesses were rude, very unprofessional and made you feel like you were a nuisance. The older hostess bumped into me with her trolley and huffed like it was the worst thing ever. They all talk and giggle in the back like it's a teenage house party, chew gum, their hair is a mess and their attitudes are disgusting. I felt so sorry for the one brillant hostess, she's holding them all up! For over 14 hours this is the last thing you want. I have not one nice to thing say about United, they ran out of eggs- no apologies. Just slammed down some pancakes with a sausage. And don't get me started on the bathrooms.",-1
2017-01-28,0.2,Business,Business Class,LAX to SYD,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,3.0,1,attendants were simply abysmal,False,"  Los Angeles to Sydney on Boeing 787. As one of the newer aircraft to United Airlines fleet I had expected a lot better than this. Seats are well below comfort standards of most Asian airlines, and whilst I had experienced some reasonable serviced in a couple of United domestic flights, the flight attendants on this route were simply abysmal. When they were visible in the cabin they seemed to spend their time smirking and chatting to each other and customers were second priority. It was like watching children misbehave and just embarrassing. On the one hand their profits shoot up, but what customers get is terrible. I don't understand why US travellers stay loyal to such a faded, out of date and poor airline, but guess it's all about flyer points. Food was passable, IFE was quite good, but the bad service overshadowed all of this - never, ever again with United.",-1
2017-01-26,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Sydney,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2,first and last time with United,False,"  This was the first and last time I ever travel with United Airlines, and will advise others not to travel with this airline. We have always traveled with Qantas and United you have a lot of catching up to do. Flight attendants were rude and unhelpful, the female attendants grooming was appalling, and food was the worst I have ever had on a flight. The staff were too busy playing on IPads rather than attend a passenger in need. The seat did not go back on a 16 hour flight and the volume on the tv did not work.",-1
2017-01-25,0.1,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Newark,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,Worst airline and service,False,"  Amsterdam to Newark. We boarded, they kept us for 2 hours sitting in the aircraft without pulling away from the terminal, due to a leaking oxygen bottle in the cockpit. Then they made us offboard the plane for 2 more hours, so in total 4 hours delay. United Airlines generously gave us a voucher for 2.5 euros, yes, 2.5 Euros. Coffee at Amsterdam airport starts at 2.80 euros. Worst airline and service I ever saw, this seems to be a trend in airlines from the US flying from Europe to the US, planes and service are far from our EU airlines.",-1
2017-01-22,0.2,Business,Premium Economy,EWR to FLL,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,continues on a downward spiral,False,"  Newark to Fort Lauderdale. I fly about 150000 miles a year on United with well over a total of one million miles flown. I belong to their 1K frequent flyers. Among my many United flights I have randomly picked this one as an example. The airline has gone through many rough patches over the last couple of years. Poor management has led to very poor performance by the company as a whole. Unmotivated front-line employees, unresponsive customer service agents, older dirty planes remain a hallmark of United. Recently, the company has revamped their lagging international business class but the nicer pillows and blankets are not enough to cover up the many other deficiencies. The flight discribed here was a case in point: tired flight attendants, delays, lost luggage, helpless customer service agents lying about measures taken. This flight had all of the catastrophes that I have come to expect from United Airlines. Many people and United employees were hoping that a new CEO could turn things around. It didn't happen and in fact United continues on a downward spiral with no end in sight. I'm sorry to say that I can only confirm the many terrible reviews here on Skytrax .",-1
2017-01-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Maui,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,got passenger's seats wrong,False,"  Chicago to Kahului. We boarded what appeared to be a new plane, and prepared for our 9 hour flight. There were no televisions to be found on this flight to Hawaii, instead they want you to purchase their wi-fi. In addition they got passenger's seats wrong, families were broken up for family vacations and couples were split up who were on their honeymoon (us). No compassion, no staff attempted to right their wrong when we clearly picked our seats together before. Instead they left the scrambling passengers to swap seats, shuffling around attempting to get families and couples together. What a wonderful way to begin our honeymoon. Needless to say we will never fly United again. They clearly do not care about their passengers. Really no TVs on a 9 hour flight?! What a wonderful start to our honeymoon as I can barely see my new husband 6 rows in front of me.",-1
2017-01-18,0.1,Business,Economy Class,MCO to SFO via FLL,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,worst customer service,False,"  Orlando to San Francisco via Fort Lauderdale. They have probably the worst customer service possible. After talking to their refund department several times and being assured that I had a $212.10 credit for my ticket, when I called to make an new reservation with my ticket (please note that I cancelled my reservation a month and a half before the flight), they informed me that I was going to be charged a $200 ticket change fee, a fee that I was not informed of by the three refund department people I spoke to. What kind of refund customer service wouldn't tell you that they charge a $200 refund ticket change fee when the ticket is only $212.10 dollars. After talking for a long time to their customer service, I gave up, and am no longer going to use United Airlines.",-1
2017-01-14,1.0,Couple Leisure,Business Class,PLS to EWR,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,"comfortable, great service",False," As always United was great, on time, comfortable, great service. No issues on my flight from Turks and Caicos to New York. We also flew them down there. Also I need to comment on the trip which I had to cancel to Aruba on Jan 9 2017, returning Jan 20. We had a medical emergency for my wife 6 days prior and I submitted the info and they refunded all our costs with no issues. This is the first time I had to cancel a trip in 45+ years. They made it so easy. I will always look forward to United being my priority carrier.",1
2017-01-13,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Toronto,5.0,,5.0,,,5.0,5,thankful to United Airlines,False,"  Washington Dulles to Toronto Pearson. On this day of travel, I needed to change my flight and the woman (I forgot her name) who helped me behind the desk did not know that if I didn't make it back to Toronto (because I didn't look ill) that I could have lost my vision permanently because I needed medical attention. I am grateful to United Airlines for accommodating my desperate need to get back to Toronto ASAP. I even tried to get help from Air Canada, who I usually fly with and they would not help me. But United Airlines was the only airlines who would help me. I will always remember United Airlines and the compassion and courteous help that the woman who worked behind the service counter gave to me. She also went above and beyond by giving me a confirmed seat and not a standby ticket. This is what all customer service should look like and I am thankful to United Airlines.",1
2017-01-12,0.8,Business,Business Class,LAX to GIG via IAH,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,4,United is slowly improving,False,"  Los Angeles to Rio de Janeiro via Houston. Nice surprise and United is slowly improving. Everything went smoothly. From check-in to landing. Not of course at the level of an Asian or Middle East airline, but matching with LH. Employees seemed more motivated than usual, planes on time, well catered lounges, etc.",1
2017-01-10,0.2,Business,Economy Class,MFE to LAX via IAH,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,make sure not to fly United again,False,  Flew for work from Los Angeles to McAllen via Houston. United Airlines did not give an excuse why the plane was late from the bay area to LA. That delay made me miss my connecting flight to McAllen. During this my luggage did not meet me at my final destination. Once my luggage arrived at my hotel it was broken. They tried to fix the problem but I still had to pay for new luggage. The return flight was worse - delay after delay and they had planes leaving to LAX. This airline needs to get their stuff straight. I will make sure not to fly United again.,-1
2017-01-09,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,EWR to AUS,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1,every representative was rude,False,"  Yesterday I traveled from Barcelona to Newark and was supposed to fly onto Austin. Once we landed in Newark, I saw that our Austin flight was cancelled.  I am here to complain about the level of service that they gave to try to get rebooked. Once someone's flight is cancelled, there should be appropriate staff to handle the volume. Every representative was rude, as if it is my fault my flight was cancelled. We were all treated like a nuisance. After going through customs, I was halfway directed to the customer service line. It was downstairs, so I tried to use the escalator across the way to go down with my huge international bag. An agent screamed at us that we could use the escalator right in front of us, to not use that one and clog it up. Well we told her the escalator is broken and we can't use it. She didn't care. For some reason we could not use use the escalator that everyone else 50m away was using. I am 7 months pregnant and carried my huge bag down those stairs. I unfortunately pulled a muscle in my stomach, I should have used it anyway but I didn't.  She still did not care. We then found the line. 100s of people were in it with two agents to help. We waited for over 4 hours. I got sick from not eating or drinking and being pregnant, but if I got out of line, I would have to start over. 30 minutes later the two agents tell us ""well we are off now, you guys have to call. Bye."" They left us. A man yelled ""I've been on hold with them for an hour and a half already!"" Most of us in tears from being there so long. I was there 4.5 hours, I don't know how long the people in the front were there. Unfortunately my phone was stolen in Spain, so I had no way to call. Simply stuck with no way to rebook. I finally found another flyer who let me borrow their phone. I understand cancelled flights, but you need to take care of your paying customers. I have never been treated that way. I am very upset, even today.",-1
2017-01-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,EWR to MIA,,,,,,1.0,1,will never fly with them again,False,"  Newark to Miami. It was snowing all day in New Jersey, and I called to confirm whether my flight to MIA was delayed or cancelled and I was told it was not. I get to the airport and they delay my 8:50 pm flight about 6 times, to the point where it's 1 AM. They tell everyone the flight is cancelled because they cannot find a pilot. On top of randomly canceling the flight after the many delayed, they do not bother to accommodate us with a voucher for a taxi back home or a hotel. They just simply said to call the airline and book another flight. Not to mention how rude and unprofessional one of the ladies at the gate was. When I asked her for information on booking the next flight she gave me an attitude and didn't even answer my question. When I called their customer service phone number and spoke to a supervisor he as well spoke to me in a very unprofessional manner and seemed very careless to hear anything of what I had to say. He didn't bother finding me any sort of accommodation either. It was so unfair that I had to drive to the airport in the terrible weather, to 5 hours later be told the flight is cancelled. And then that I had to pay for my own transportation back home. There were so many angry customers because everyone was pretty much stuck st the airport and United Airlines refused to help!  Terrible experience and I will never fly with them again.",-1
2017-01-05,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SLC to ORD,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,left me with no food,False,"  Salt Lake City to Chicago. First, we were late for takeoff by approximately 30 minutes, just sitting at the gate. While this isn't usually a big deal, someone came on the speaker and said ""I'm really not sure why we haven't been cleared yet."" Really? Then why bother making the announcement? This lack of explanation was more concerning to myself and those was around me than saying nothing at all would have been. The seats were so close together, and I'm only 5'2"" and 110lbs. This airline offers no snack options for individuals with Celiac's disease/gluten intolerance. Instead of giving passengers options from the cart, one flight attendant was giving everyone small blue bags of some sort of trail mix. The flight attendant had a cart full of snacks he could have been offering. When I asked if he had any gluten free options, he said ""I can't tell you if it's gluten free but you can look in the menu and try to buy something."" He couldn't be bothered with telling me the other options he had in his cart. When I looked at the menu the only completely gluten free option offered was a small bag of popcorn that costs almost $6. I asked the other flight attendant if there were any snacks like bananas, ""kind"" trailmix bars, or baked potato chips in the front of the plane. Her response was ""I don't know but the snacks for up front are you know, for up front."" So instead of sacrificing one snack item from the front of the plane that probably costs less than a dollar in actuality, both attendants left me with no food for the duration of the flight. I flew with Delta last week and they were much more accommodating and pleasant. While they did not have gluten free snacks in economy either, the attendants did manage to find a banana and a ""kind"" bar for me in ""the front"" of the plane, after I only mentioned my gluten intolerance to them once. In comparison, Deltas entertainment system is also far more superior to United's. The only positive thing I can say about this trip with United is that my neighbor (after buying an hour of wifi for $8) did mention that the wifi connection was good. I've never had wifi connectivity issues on any plane though, so I'm not sure this says much.",-1
2017-01-04,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PWM to MKE,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,they can't do anything about it,False,"  Awful experience - that pretty much sums up a seemingly amazing trip turned upside down when my flight was delayed. It all started with a simple 30 minute delay, which then crumbled into a mess. The original time was 6.40 pm and that time was delayed three times. After the third time they delayed it for good, meaning United delayed the flight for 13 hours. If that was not an inconvenience I do not really know what is. Not to mention that I was also relying on a connection flight that I also missed because of the unclear reasons given. United did me a ""favor"" by booking me another connection flight with a 7 hour layover. I needed to be home that day but instead I get to waste 7 hours of my day in an airport. What makes this even worse is the fact that they did not compensate any of the passengers on the plane. Fast forward and it's the next morning. You get up at 5 am and drive to the airport and get on the plane. The plane arrives at an airport where your connection is. Time is getting closer to the departure time and then it happens. The flight is delayed once again. This time it's for 3 hours (keep in mind I needed to be home a whole day ago). Now they apologize and say they can't do anything about it. This is probably the worst airline out there. United does not care about its passengers nor compensating the people they mess around.",-1
2017-01-04,0.1,Family Leisure,Economy Class,OMA to SFO,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,1,very poor customer service,False,"  Very displeased with United Airlines. Our flight from Omaha to San Francisco was scheduled to leave at 7.30am this morning. At 7.30am no one had started boarding and no one announced anything over the speakers. The screens still said the flight was on time. The delay time changed on the screen every hour, pushing the flight time further into the day. I am traveling with my cousin and the only way we found out about the delays were through automated text messages sent to her phone. No one announced anything over the speakers to us while we waited at the gate. I am fine with a delayed flight, but it's been 8 hours. When we tried to ask about what was going on with our flight, the woman at the desk avoided all eye contact and walked away. We didn't see her again. We went downstairs to the main desk and asked about other flying options and the woman at this desk said we didn't have any other options. We hopped on the website afterwards and figured out we could change it ourselves. Very poor customer service. These workers don't seem too concerned about answering any of our questions. Our flight was delayed so many times due to ""maintenance issues"" eventually they gave up and switched planes. The plane we are now on is apparently having problems too. We are all sitting on the plane waiting to take off after waiting for this flight. At least the flight attendants and the captain are nice.",-1

Terrible airline, more times than not they are delayed by not only mins but hours when weather is perfect. One of my last choices. Air travel is good but don't expect to make your layover connection.

We arrived at the airport and the ground crew who accepted our luggage was as unhelfpul and impolite. Our luggage was one kilo to heavy and the guy was making a big scene out of it, afterwards we just through a towel away and he was happy. The flight was horrible. I booked my flight on the lufthansa homepage, and if I would have known that I'm flying with United I would have never booked it. Just a brief look at the Skytrax rating showed me what I should expect and the reality is even worse. The entertainment system was broken, my front seat pocket was ripped, one toilet was out of order so lots of waiting people standing next to me during the flight. The toilet was filthy when I used it and the toilet seat was broken. This was just a horrible, terrible flight not worth a penny.",-1

The overall experience honestly couldn't have been worse. I am an eternal optimist and frequent traveler, so it is very uncharictaristic of me to complain about travel experiences. Sadly, United Airlines has been a collasal disappointment. In one trip they have managed to delay flights for over 24 hours on the front end, lose luggage and currently delayed returning flights for 3 hours. Their customer service workers are incredibly rude and not helpful. I am honestly amazed that this company is still in business based on their poor customer service and apparent inability to run an efficient operation. Avoid this airline at all cost.",-1

The New York to Chicago flight was nice trip and bumpy so service was suspended for safety reasons. Chicago to Vancouver a nasty air crew looking to upset customers. We sat in the third row or first of premium economy. We were ordered shortly after take off not to congregate or line up for toilets in the rear. Since we were up front making it to the toilet without anyone getting in front of you was impossible. Due to this fact I did not drink on aircraft as at 65 it can be painful to wait. We were offered no food as promised for our two hungry boys. They did get a third of a can of Sprite as this was their second long flight they asked for another drink of Sprite. They were refused. My wife asked for water instead politely. I asked for the purser to request an additional sprite as United advertises complimentary beverages. He did deliver. I thanked him profusely but now I was unbeknownst to me a marked man. I sat quietly until I was in dire need of a toilet. There were eight people in first class all sitting comfortably so I quickly used the front toilet. You would think I had threatened the aircraft. When I exited I was berated and demeaned by that same purser and ordered back to my seat. Where else I would go at 36,000 feet in the air was a mystery to me. I complied without incident. I did tell him quietly before landing he was a rude man for embarrassing me for using a toilet. On arrival the pilot came bounding out of the cockpit and had requested security at the gate. A toilet offense had apparently endangered the aircraft in some ridiculous fashion. He proceeded to lie about me talking to staff which had not happened. I was accused of blocking the aisle which had not happened. The security personnel dismissed the incident and we all went home. United is not passenger friendly and rather than attack or correct complaints they attack the complainer.",-1

Flight boarded early and left on time arriving a bit early in Newark. Flight crew were professional and pleasant. While IFE was provided via Direct TV, the system was difficult to turn off and passengers were subjected to an announcement / advertisement at the start of the flight which I personally found annoying. I did not really want to watch bad news on the TV screen and it took several tries to get it shut off. That and the fact that Newark is a pretty poor airport where the only issues with this flight. Passengers should be aware that a plane change in Newark may mean having to go through security screening again. This was the case for me in going from Terminal C to Terminal A. Wonder what passengers arriving from one of the nice European or Asian airports think when they arrive in such a scruffy airport.",1

They had a full house but the service was pathetic. The flight charging points were not working, headphones were not working. They had a deficit of non veg meals and forced passengers to go for the vegeterian options. The flight crew was unattentive to the customer requests and were tough to catch. They even refused to provide drinking water and said the supply was over for economy class passengers just prior to the landing in Newark. The meal choices were limited and compared to Middle East carriers was nothing. When I spoke with the manager, he said that he is sorry for the state of things but could not help or compensate in anyway.",-1

The service is bad and they just don't care about you. We wanted to get seats together, but that was impossible. They did not even try to ask the other passengers. We made a mistake with 1 letter of one of our last names and it was such a big deal to change it. It took the staff just 2 minutes to get it fixed but the drama they made. In business class you are not able to lie down. The food is okay - eggs and sausages, however not even a normal toast with it.",-1

Upon arrival at SXM, we were told our 4:25pm flight was pushed back to 8pm due to late arrival of the aircraft. Understandable, considering the terrible weather throughout the US. After departure was delayed until 9pm, we were informed that the flight was canceled. Why? Depended on whom you asked: the crew was over their service limit; Customs in SXM wasn't willing to stay later to accommodate passengers; or The airline hasn't told us why. Passengers were told to find their own hotel accommodations overnight and to report for check-in at 7am. Upon returning to the airport in the morning, there were a couple hundred people in line and no United staff at the check-in counter. When they finally arrived, we were told that their systems were down. As they dithered over whether to check in people manually, our departure time was constantly pushed back. Crowd control at check-in was handled by other passengers. Check-in staff was surly. Departure was just after 1pm, which put us on the ground at IAD just after 4pm. As we deplaned, we went through the transfer channel as we were told only to find out that because of the manual check-in at SXM, our bags were only tagged as far as IAD. That meant our baggage was sent to another terminal. We had to wait an hour to be reunited with our stuff so we could re-check for the trip to YYZ at 10:20pm. But then around 9, we heard of another delay due to the late arrival of the aircraft from STL because of mechanical problems. We finally got off the ground at about 2am. When we arrived, we were parked at a remote stand far from the terminal. No bus arrived to transport us, so we had to brave through -20 weather in the snow. No apologies. No compensation. Nothing.",-1

Attendant in Buffalo said not to worry about connection because there were a lot of people connecting with me. Got to Newark, missed connection. Supervisor was rude. United would not pay for food, taxi or hotel. I slept on the airport floor. Then they flew me to San Juan instead of Aguadilla. I had to rent another car to drive 4 hrs to my destination. I also lost 1 day on my hotel, rental car and vacation. United said sorry we cannot do anything for you. The Buffalo attendant could have offered us the choice of staying home in Buffalo and leaving the next day.",-1
2016-12-27,0.1,Business,Premium Economy,LIT to IAH,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,I had to move,False,  Typical United flight running late from Little Rock to Houston. The worst part came when I was ask to leave my seat that I had paid an upgrade for and to go to the rear of plane so a family with child could have my seat. It's they way I was told that made me the maddest that I had to move. When I asked if I would get my money back I was told that I could take another flight. I always upgrade my flights always for more room. Now I am in the back with a crying baby. So what was so special about the baby that bumped me from my seat?,-1
2016-12-26,0.1,Business,Economy Class,CLE to EWR,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,avoid this airline at all cost,False,"  Made, confirmed and paid for a flight at 640p from Cleveland to Newark. Discovered less than 48hrs before departure that time/flight was changed by the airline to 8hrs earlier without notifying me. I called a spoke to two different customer reps. The first was not interested in addressing the changes to my flight and left me on hold for 1/2 hour after which I hung up. Called again 15 mins later where the second agent felt the need to provide misinformation, put me on hold and then hung up on me after a 20 min hold time. No matter what, this will be my last flight on United Airlines. They lack the ability to provide any degree of customer service even when they are in the wrong as clearly they are. They should be forced to close their doors and spare the consumer from even having them as an option for travel. I strongly suggest that the public avoid this airline at all cost. These types of issues speak to a greater problem United has.",-1

I bought a first class ticket at full fare, which was at least twice the coach fare. I had my seat selected and confirmed and paid in full of course. On the day of the flight I checked in. While waiting at the gate I saw on their United Airlines screen the names of 2 passengers upgraded to first class. Shortly thereafter I was called and I was told I was downgraded to coach because they were overbooked! They said they would give me a voucher of $250. I was appalled and I felt that I was cheated by United Airlines. The staff at United gate said they were overbooked and I was downgraded because my fare was the lowest of all the first class passengers on that plane. But I paid full fare and it was the lowest probably because I bought the ticket 6 months in advance - but it was a full fare and it was still more than twice the fare of coach. The staff member said I could either wait 3 hours for the next flight or fly coach this flight. I asked why they upgraded 2 passengers to first class and downgrade me when I paid full first class fare. This staff member denied that they upgraded anyone. (Another passenger whom I didn't know later confirmed to me that she also saw on the TV screen 2 passengers upgraded.) I said I was going to complain because I felt that United Airlines cheated my money because I paid full fare for first class and they put me in coach for a voucher of $250. Their staff said, ""Go ahead to complain. I am just carrying out company policy."" They never even apologised the whole time.",-1
2016-12-22,0.6,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CDG to EWR,2.0,3.0,2.0,,,2.0,2,product was disappointing,False,"  Having flown Business Class from Bangkok on a A380 Thai Airways to Paris to connect to United Airlines business Class to Newark, the difference was striking. The United much hyped Polaris business class product was disappointing. Unfortunately the Polaris seats and configuration is still the old narrow flat seats in the 2-4-3 configuration where all passengers don't have aisle access and window and middle seats have to ask the aisle passenger to get up. On my flight, there was a extra Polaris trainer on board for the cabin attendants but still the service was not smooth or elegant. Polaris is suppose to understand that rest and sleep is primary to the business flyer but the meal service took at least 2.5 hours with them still beginning to serve the ice cream when the lights were already dimmed. There was such a long time between courses as if the attendents didn't know what to do. I was seated next to the galley and watched them being disorganized and clumsy as the curtain was not closed. The Thai Airways personal cabin attendant knew my name as she introduced herself and all the courses, refill of drinks arrived swiftly and effortlessly like magic from behind a curtain. The cabin was always a sea of calm and tranquil unlike United noisy clatter. The one thing that was superior on United's Polaris was the cuisine. The salad was fresh and the courses plated well and restaurant quality. If only if United's Polaris could train their cabin attendants to a much higher standard of providing smooth professional service as if in a quality restaurant rather than a busy diner.",-1

2016-12-20,0.3,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HKG to IAH,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2,terrible planning failure,False,"  I flew UA895, 12/16/16 from Hong Kong to San Francisco, then UA 638 from San Francisco to Houston. UA895 was 12 hours long, and was advertised as having inflight entertainment and wifi when I booked it. The aircraft was old, so it had no personal TVs on the back of the chairs, just the main one near bulkhead. Not a big deal, but about 45 minutes into the flight, we were told the WiFi wasn't working. They tried resetting it, then called tech support, but could not fix it. We were told that because it was considered a ""premium"" item, we wouldn't be compensated. I didn't expect compensation, but on a 12 hour flight, I expected some effort to be made to make everyone more comfortable. Instead, there were 4 children in our cabin and they took turns crying for the entire 12 hours. I understand kids cry, and I felt terrible for the parents, they looked fatigued. The kids would only stop crying when the parents walked the aisles with them or stood where they could see the TVs, which obviously wasn't sustainable for a multitude of reasons. I imagine the flight would've been much more enjoyable for the parents, children, and other passengers if the wi-fi had worked. Additionally, even the entertainment on the screen near bulkhead crashed mid flight and had to be re-set, so even that was flawed. My second flight, UA153, was scheduled to depart at 12:05pm. At first it was delayed by 20 minutes, ""due to delayed incoming aircraft."" I decided to look it up, and saw that the flight, UA424, Dulles to San Francisco, was originally scheduled from 08.50-12.06. Yes, the scheduled landing was for 1 minute after our flight was scheduled to depart. This is a terrible planning failure on behalf of United, who knowingly scheduled a flight they knew wasn't going to depart at the scheduled time. Our flight didn't end up departing until close to 2pm, after loading up around 1.15, and then taxiing for a long time. Multiple people on our flight had connecting flights, which were missed or they narrowly made it to, especially since United didn't accommodate or prioritize their exit from the aircraft. This is extremely frustrating, especially knowing that United knowingly did this. There were over 100 people on the aircraft, all delayed an extra 1.5-2 hours, plus the people who missed their connecting flights and were even further delayed. United wasted 200+ hours of people's time that day. It seems extremely fraudulent that they knowingly did this. Last, I'm taking time to write this review this time, as every time I have flown United, I have experienced a delay of at least 1 hour. It is extremely disappointing as a customer. For example, on our flight from ORD to HKG, we were delayed by almost 5 hours. On a flight I took from DFW to XNA once, I was delayed by 4 hours. Unfortunately, this just seems to be something you have to expect and plan for when flying United.",-1
2016-12-19,0.2,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,SEA to MCO via ORD,2.0,,5.0,,,1.0,1,never fly United Airlines again,False,"  Seattle to Orlando via Chicago. As an American citizen traveling domestically, over the past 15 years, I've come to set the bar about as low as it can get for flying. That said, I will never fly United Airlines again. Enough is enough. My boyfriend and I had pre-selected our seats, yet did not have seat assignments after checking in. It's the holidays, so lines were long at check in. There was a woman in line with several suitcases, two of which were less than 4lbs over the weight limit. Instead of just taking pity on her and expediting the line by accepting her suitcases on the first, second, third and fourth times she repacked them, employees felt it was a better option to continue to hold up the line and create confusion as she kept having to drag her suitcases back and forth. Know when to just cut your losses. Because of the seating issue I was not able to sit with my boyfriend on the second flight. Upon landing, we learned that one of our suitcases was not on the plane, leaving my boyfriend with none of his things. We were told that it would be delivered to our hotel (2 hours away) by the end of the day. I am sceptical, but will see. My own brand new suitcase's retractable handle is now completely broken and won't budge from its retracted position. I was curtly informed that they are not liable for this damage. I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back, so it's very uncomfortable if not painful to try and drag my suitcase around without a retractable handle. So thanks a lot for that, United. We paid $25 per bag for this ""service,"" but no refund was offered. And they'll gouge us again on the way home. These weren't cheap tickets, with the time of year. My money will never go to United again.",-1
2016-12-19,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AUA to IAD,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1,will never fly this airline again,False,"  Aruba to Washington. This has been by far the worst experience ever. I have never had so many hiccups in one day it's ridiculous. I arrived to the airport 6 hrs early because of an emergency and I was not able to be moved to an earlier flight or wasn't given the option to fly standby for ""open"" flights without a $75 fee. I waited for my original flight which wasn't until 5:15 pm, just to get a text stating the flight was delayed one hour and fifteen minutes. The lady at the counter refused to look up my flight info and give me any options or additional information. I get on the plane at 6:07pm and sit until 7:45 because of issues with lighting. At this point I am now over 2 hrs behind schedule and the only accommodation they gave us were 9 movies to choose from for a 3 hour flight! The cable wasn't available for free (as they stated) until the last 30 minutes of the flight. Once we land of course my connecting flight took off without me due to us being 2 hrs behind schedule. We landed at 10:27 and my flight left at 10:00. I waited in a customer service line until 12:00 midnight. The people at the desk were taking people out of order and had attitudes when questions were asked. I was refused a voucher for a taxi home the next day and told to go online. I was accommodated with a hotel that I didn't get checked into until 1:40 in the morning with a shuttle coming to get me in two and a half hours. I was not able to locate my bags so I had to travel and stay at a hotel with nothing. I will never fly this airline again.  They don't accommodate you for anything. Their customer service sucks. I had to walk away from 3 employees because of their rude attitudes. The delays are uncalled for and a big inconvenience. Neither delay I had were due to weather!",-1

Our flight was scheduled to depart on Dec 17th, 2016 at 6.10 am via Denver. Due to extreme weather conditions the flight was cancelled. After a long wait of 3 hours with only a single person to rebook all customers in other flights, we finally got our turn to speak with the staff. We were given only one option that is, ""You have flight only the following day and there are no more available for today"". I understood their situation as they could not provide me with any flight for that day as there are no seats available. After long waits we finally reached home with boarding passes for the following day.  We woke up early again in the morning and checked the status online on United Airlines website. It mentioned there is a delay in flight timings but the scheduled time of departure is still shown at 6.10 am. I thought they will send an email or a text message incase if there is really one. And once again after paying for the cabs and reaching there on time we found that the flight is delayed by 4 hours. I felt deceived. I spoke to an attendant as to why I was not informed about the delay and she told I will get back to me in a moment and went on serving the customers at other kiosk without ever bothering to respond me. I then waited for 15 minutes to speak with another one and she asked how I made my resevation and I explained her it was through Priceline. And she tried to blame them as it is their fault and they have to inform me. I told her that these were new boarding passes which were issued by United Airlines at the kiosk. Her response ""Yeah right. I dont know"". I told her it is not a problem if there is a delay but it is your responsibility to inform me so that I would not have come early. Her response, ""I know but i cant do anything. You could wait at the airport or leave and then come back at around 9.30 am as that is when the boarding starts"". Is she going to pay us for the cabs? Cant they see what efforts we might have gone through to come to airport in the icy conditions with heavy luggage? She then tried to blame the weather when I told her the flight to and from the same locations in Southwest is running at scheduled time. Then she said, ""I don't control anything here. I don't know why the scheduled time in website was not updated"". In the end, I have to leave the counter with frustration. I dont see an inch of regret or an apology from their side for their mistake. We just sat there doing nothing and looked at the timings of other flights. There were few other flights whose status is either cancelled or delayed and all of them belonged to United Airlines.",-1

No matter how many times I've flown with United Airlines in hopes their services would improve I have been constantly disappointed and today it reached my limit. Delays back to back with false hope for 6 hours. Their customer service is terrible, doesn't compensate for their shortcomings and is so confused and mismanaged. Customer service doesn't try to work with the customers plans which is frustrating and this largely falls on the head of management for not considering how much money the customers spends and they should up hold customer values instead of diminish customers probability of ever flying united.",-1

I thought I would give United Airlines one more chance. Nearly every past trip with them has turned sour due to delays caused by flight crew absences or maintenance issues. I am now 6 hours delayed in Denver, and have talked to other people on this delayed flight who have been in this airport for over 38 hours! In my experience, United Airlines consistently fails to get their planes off the ground on time. In addition to delays, I always have a better quaity experience with other major airlines. For instance, during my 6 hour flight last night from Honolulu to Denver, we were brought drinks 2 times, and no snacks were offered. Last month on a very similar (yet longer, approx. 8 hour flight) trip with Delta, they provided two complementary full, hot meals, many rounds of drink service, and they even came through the cabin 4 times with individual 16 oz bottles of Dasani. I will never fly United again if given the option.",-1

Why schedule flight when there is maintenance to be done? Additionally, today I was rushed to the kiosk after I told the attendant that I had a minor traveling alone. I had to go out of my way to get checked in and the young lady who helped us seemed confused with the process and wanted to charge me additional fees that I had already paid when I purchased the ticket. I will shop around for other airlines since my son travels at least four times a year, and I don't want to deal with this repetitive pattern again.",-1

I'm active duty military so I got through TSA fairly quickly, and proceeded to my gate. About an hour before boarding I got a text that said my flight would be delayed till 11pm (5 hour delay) due to ""awaiting aircraft."" This made me slightly mad due to the fact that I don't understand why an airline is selling tickets for a flight they can't even provide an aircraft for. I was then told I could fly down to Washington DC at 11pm, arrive at 1am and have to sit there till 830am to make my next flight. I was supposed to be at my final destination in California at 730am, so I accepted it and went to the USO to relax till my 11pm flight. A couple hours before that I got a text that said my flight had been cancelled due to ""operations.""  I won't be getting home until 3 in the afternoon now. United Airlines needs to get their customer service up to par. Don't sell tickets if you can't get your customers to their destination. If it was bad weather I could understand that.

Seats were most uncomfortable I have sat in. The backs seem to keep you leaning forward with an odd curve and the leg room is very tight. This airline should be shut down. The only reason I will ever take them again is because they are cheaper than others, but unfortunately this comes with great compromises to comfort.",-1

I was nervous about flying United as it does not have a great reputation but the schedule was good and it worked out. The outbound flight was fine and the First Class seats were comfortable (better than the American First Class cabins I have flown recently) but did need a bit of cleaning. Crew was fine, boarding was easy as flight was not full and we arrived early. The return flight was a very pleasant surprise. The captain greeted boarding passengers and came into the cabin to use the PA and provide flight info. He advised a strong tailwind would get us in early but we might get some chop due to it. He introduced all the crew and also explained that he was holding the flight for a passenger on an international connection since this was the last flight to RDU that evening. But even with the hold we would get to RDU early. Flight was reasonably smooth with occasional bumpiness but the captain changed altitude several times to find smoother air. Cabin staff were pleasant and the premium economy seating was fine (though it was the most expensive premium economy I have purchased on any of the 3 legacy carriers.) Apparently IFE is available for free if you download the United app but I did not bother so cannot comment on the quality of the IFE.

It used to be the best US airline but it is clearly not anymore. I had a single ticket for 5 flights and had lots of issues. After receiving my tickets in ROC, my name did not appear on the boarding list in SFO, thus I had to wait for nearly one hour before getting a seat. There was no IFE in most of flights: although Wi-Fi was supposed to provide access to movies, it did not work in any of the flights I took. On the flight GUM-PVG the IFE was in the form of small screens at the back of the seat. Movie selection was poor. Flights were mostly late: SFO-HNL was more than 1 our late. I was upgraded to premium seats on the SFO-HNL and HNL-GUM flights. Seats are OK. Although we were supposed to receive a meal on the GUM-PVG flight, I did not receive any food. The positive aspect is the cabin crew, that has always been attentive and professional. The flight cost was OK.",-1
2016-12-01,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CUN to SNN via EWR,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3,United offer a good experience,False,"  Cancun – Shannon via Newark: Booked with United as they offered the most convenient connections back to Ireland. Check in at Cancun was self check in with a bag drop. There were no queues at the United desks which made for a pleasant experience. Boarding was organised into groups which was convenient for me as I was in group 2. The flight was uneventful and on time, leg room was a little on the tight side, I used the Direct TV which had a large offering of videos and TV stations for a fee. United only serve a small snack and drink on the flight for free and pay for sandwiches and alcoholic drinks. Transit in Newark was quick for immigration but very slow for TSA, but I had plenty of time. Flight to Ireland was a better experience with good leg room, choice of movies on demand and a good quality meal which consisted of a starter and main course, followed by an Ice cream and bottle of water as a separate serving, which was a nice touch. The flight had turbulence mid way over the Atlantic, but the Captain kept us well informed and ascended throughout the flight to avoid as much of the turbulence as possible. Crew were very friendly, helpful and professional throughout the flight. Landed ahead of time in Shannon, Captain even met the passengers on the airbridge and thanked us for flying with them, a very nice touch. Overall United offer a good experience especially on the transatlantic sector and fantastic route connections in Newark.",1

I was flying to Chicago for a conference. My flight was to depart from San Diego at 1.30 and arrive at 7.30 local time. Upon arrival at SD I was informed the plane was experiencing ""mechanical issues"" AKA ""we undersold the flight and are going to merge it with another"". The attendant offered online vouchers which he said would be available after the flight had departed. They weren't. I am a celiac and I did not pack food because I was having dinner in Chicago that night which, I missed. Airplane food at best is inedible but add gluten free and you're stuffed. I packed nothing because I didn't think I was going to need to. Error! The flight landed in O'Hare at 10.30pm and of course everything on a Monday was shut. By the time I got to my Hotel room and went back out to look for food it was 12.30. Upon return that week I wrote to United as speaking to a human is impossible. Anyway they were so generous in offering me a whole $50 dollars in flight vouchers. Luckily I won't be able to cash them in because I would never fly (voluntarily) United. It was the second time this year and the last for a long time I hope. The few dollars saved just didn't add up the the trauma of flying with this outfit. Never again.",-1

Last year, I accidentally scheduled my flight home on Christmas eve night, instead of in the morning. I was very upset because that would have meant I would miss out on Christmas eve dinner and all our family Christmas eve traditions. I was so disappointed at my mistake, especially since I don’t get to see my family very often. I called United, expecting them to only offer to sell me another ticket or charge me a large fee because that is my experience with most airlines. But to my surprise, the woman on the phone was very friendly and helpful and offered to change my flight, with no fees, to the morning so that I could make it home for our family’s Christmas celebrations. I was so relieved! This past October I flew United to Europe and will continue to use them in the future and highly recommend them to others.",1

United's new First Class seat is very comfortable, the TV screen is large and there are plenty of storage areas. The hard product is good but not top of its class.

2016-11-28,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CLE to MKE via ORD,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,this is unacceptable,False,"  I will never fly United again and this is why. I was to depart Cleveland to Chicago on 26 November at 6:35pm. We did not leave the runway until 8:25pm for a fuel overfilling. I have never heard of such a thing! There 4 updates given and they were not timely and obviously they were not accurate. We arrived in Chicago at 8:38p. My connecting flight was to depart Chicago at 8:50pm and boarding stopped at 8:35pm. I asked several flight attendants if my gate could be called and I was told they couldn't control that. It seemed like I was the only person on this plane with that connecting flight. There were others going to Istanbul Turkey that United called ahead for them not to miss their connection. An announcement was even made that they didn't need to rush. When we landed in Chicago I had to run from gate B14 to E1. I have never run so fast, in heels, in my life. When I arrived at E1 the plane had pulled away. I was livid! I went to a customer service counter for assistance and was told there were no more flights leaving Chicago to Milwaukee that night and that I could take a bus. A bus? I didn't want to but I was ready to go home to say the least. The time then was 9:00pm. I was told the bus wasn't leaving until 10:45p and it was the last bus. Arriving Milwaukee at 12:30am. I inquired about my luggage and was given instructions on how to get it. After going to another service counter, I was able to get my luggage, 20 minutes later. The second service counter attendant told me the bus shuttle was right outside the door and to follow the red Bus Shuttle sign. She even pointed to a Coach bus going by telling me that's where I'd get on the bus. I hadn't been on a bus since I was 12 years old. She offered and gave $20 worth of food vouchers but I didn't use them. I was too distraught. I sat in the terminal waiting to go to the bus stop. At 10:15 something told me to go and find out exactly where I needed to stand. I asked an airport shuttle driver and he told me to follow him. He pointed to shuttles/buses that were across the street and about a 10 minute walk away! I had to run again, this time with luggage. As I entered the bus terminal there was no one available to ask which stop, 4, 5,6, etc, I was supposed to stand near. I asked the transit cop and he told me to stand at #4. I asked what time was the bus coming. He said the bus usually gets there at 10:30pm. My watch said 10:32p. He then said he must be running a little late. I didn't want to take any chances so I stool outside the terminal, right in front of the #4 stand, waiting for the bus. Once on the bus, the driver announced since this was the last bus of the night he had to wait an additional 10 minutes before departing. I arrived at the bus station in Milwaukee WI at 12:38am. For a travel trip that should not have been more than 50 minutes in the air, I ended up spending almost 9 hours to reach my destination. To say this is unacceptable is an understatement.",-1

I purchased my tickets predicated on scheduled departure, layover time and cost. After committing to my flights 5 months prior to the departure date the departure and layover times were changed 4 times. I contacted my booking agent and United Airlines and neither were sympathetic to my problem. They have you sign off on each change to ensure you don't take advantage of the accumulated delays which would warrant some compensation in the form of changing flights more to my requirements. Now for the entertainment on the flight. The video would stall every 10 minutes and you would loose 10 seconds of the movie. Overhead old style screens made it difficult to view from my window seat. United online movies would have been an option but without a power charging jack it was not an option. Food was terrible on the United leg of the flight. Soggy breaded chicken swimming in sodium laddened gravy. The ANA flights provided exceptional quality on both food and entertainment. Price was good but I question the true value. I will opt to fly on a more expensive higher quality airline next time.",-1

We had a family member that flew on Southwest and were able to travel and at no point was the flight cancelled due to weather. Same departure city Houston, same time 9 am, same arrival time 2 pm, instead we are not only kept in the dark but left with the responsibility of finding accommodation until tomorrow - meanwhile we are now paying for two hotels, one in Houston away from family, and in Costa Rica where we should have been.

United assumed operations to my hometown from Delta a few years ago and the service has become garbage. Almost every flight I've been on has been delayed or canceled. Every time I fly there it's a toss up whether or not I make it and chances are good I won't make it back to work on time. If given the option, take a different airline. In addition to their inability to manage the flight leg, their planes have uncomfortable seats and are usually too hot. If anybody from United reads this, you should go talk with a Delta rep and learn from them. Service wasn't this terrible when they managed the flight.",-1

Granted, there's neither a meal service in economy nor seat back entertainment anywhere, but fairly good hot food and alcoholic beverages can be bought, and one can either read a book or do the puzzles in the ""Hemispheres"" magazine. The crew was pleasant and eager to please. Seats in the 2-5-2 seating configuration were quite comfortable, which we hope United maintains for this long flight. We both managed a few hours' sleep, so were quite rested on arrival and ready for our Hawaiian Airlines connection to the Big Island.

Flight attendants rude - had multiple flight attendants bump into me with carts with no apologies. Offered 1 complimentary soda, with optional water now and then. Seat tv controls were located on top of the armrest which provided no room for my arms to rest without adjusting multiple aspects of tv. That was only if the any type of entertainment was offered for the 6 hour flight. Had to use my ipad for entertainment. On the way back they would not offer internet due to unavailable for transocean flight, (even though it was on the previous flight to Hawaii) which price for both flights were identical. United offer a direct tv option only with excessive credit card charges. It should also be mentioned that they even showed pricing for flights that were over 2 hours were charged more per movie. Boarding agent almost would not to let me take my normal sized carry on, due to space limitations. When all I had was on small bag that fit in all there metal measuring racks. After telling her I was not checking my bag got on the plane and there was so much space in the overheads that some remained open after passengers were all seated.

We sat on the tarmac in Orlando for 2 hours with very little air conditioning. The delay was because of lightning and I do understand that but we were given a plastic cup of tepid water during those 2 hours. When we spoke to the flight attend to let her know we had a connecting flight in Newark to Venice (there were others on the flight who also had connecting flights overseas). When we told her she assured us that because it was another United Flight they would call ahead and let them know we would be delayed and to hold the flight. She also told us we would be arriving at the same terminal as our departure terminal C. She assured us she would allow the passengers with connecting overseas flights to disembark first. None of this happened! The fight arrived at 6:35, we arrived at terminal B, she did not get us off the flight first, and no one had called ahead to hold the flight. I have heart problems and my husband And I ran through the airport where I started to feel like I was going to have a heart attack. We managed to wave down a cart and he took us the rest of the way. We got to the terminal where our flight was leaving from at 6:45 the lady at the desk said run down and get on the flight - only to find the door had been closed. The flight departure time was 6:55! I was so worn out by this time we walked back to the front desk and she said she would call operations - they got permission to open the door and let us on. When we went to find our seats there were people sitting in them so we stood trying to see what to do. Eventually I said to a flight attendant who was ignoring the situation do you think you can help us. She came and walked us round and round to try to find seats for us. I spotted two seats across the aisle from each other and said we will take those seats. I would also like to remind you that we booked this flight and our seats in May 2016. Not very happy with the experience and have written to United Airlines head office with no response at all. I guess they are thinking we will go away. That will not happen I will put this on social media I can find until I get a response.",-1

Food was ok. I had very good rest throughout the flight. Apparently the aircraft was manned by crew from Continental Airline (now merged with United) and they have high service standard. Two meals and a snack was given, but passengers were welcomed to go to the galley for more. Passengers were advised not to congregate at the alley, but for such a long flight, it will be good to allow passengers to walk around, mingle with the crew (provided not disturbing their duties) and also mingle among the passengers themselves, to sit still throughout 16+ hours on own seat will be kinda tough.

The only reason I opted to fly United for my annual trip to San Francisco on the anniversary of my mother's death is because I had a $120 voucher from my last United flight experience being so atrocious. Flight was due to depart at 10:45 this morning; it's not 1:20, I should be landing in OKC right now. Instead, I'm still in SFO airport because of the laundry-list of things that have gone wrong with United today. Crew wasn't in the airport until after noon, with no back-up crew.  Boarded at 12:20; de-boarded at 12:30 due to ""maintenance issues"" that were not elucidated upon. (No one could have checked the plane that was sitting on the runway for two hours during the first delay?)  Issues ""should"" be fixed by 1:45, but at this point, I'm not exactly holding my breath. No offers of compensation/complimentary alcoholic beverages, etc. All this just compiles my last two horrible flights with United, where my luggage was lost twice and customer service just stared at me like cows chewing cud when I asked if I could be compensated for that mess. The hardest-working people for United are the outsourced staff in Pakistan and India, who were the most helpful people I have spoken to when I've had to contact United customer service. This airline is abysmal, unfriendly, and not worth your time, money, and business. Run, don't walk, to another airline.",-1
2016-11-05,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,BDL to EWR,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,"constant rudeness, unhelpfulness",False,"  This was the worst airplane experience I have ever encountered. My friend and I were going to Orlando and chose United Airlines because they were most convenient.  On our way down to MCO we had a connecting flight in Newark, NJ. We boarded the plane as normal in Hartford and we were on it for 2 minutes before being told to get off because there was something wrong. We departed the plane and was out for another 2 minutes before telling us to reboard. We couldn't take off right away which made us late and when we finally did we knew we weren't going to catch the next flight. They told us to just go to customer service and get a new flight. When we reach Newark, we did just that. We got another flight pretty close to the other one. We boarded like normal, and five minutes in, they tell us they have to change the brakes. They said it would be a 30 min job. After that, they said they had to change a tire. That was supposed to be another 15mins. After that, they broke a piece and we weren't going anywhere. After that, they got a new piece and we were going. 20 mins after that we were finally in the air. We didn't land in Orlando until after 2pm, when we were supposed to be there at 11am. They offered us free alcoholic drinks because of the long wait. When my friend and I ordered she rudely asked for ID like we were lying or something and then made us split a drink instead of giving us one each. 4 days go by and it was time to go home. I received a text the morning of my flight (3am) saying that my flight will be delayed. This was the 3rd flight to be delayed. I had to go to Newark before Hartford as it was my connecting flight again. When we arrived at the airport and got to our terminal we asked about the delay and what to do about our connecting flight. The man at the desk said, ""I believe you will still make it, I can move your seats closer to the front to make sure you get off the plane in time."" We obviously believed him. It took us a while to get in the air and when we landed we rushed off and ran to our gate. It was closed. When I asked the man at the counter about it he said ""listen, I didn't work the flight."" I never asked if he did. I was then told to go to customer service. When I did so, the woman said she would put us on the 9:30pm flight to Hartford since that was the one leaving next. I was supposed to be in Hartford at 4pm. I didn't want to be in the airport for another 6 hours and get home by 10pm. I mentioned renting a car because Newark was 2 hours from my home and she said that United will not pay for it because they're offering me a 9:30pm flight as compensation. She then stated, and I quote, ""Well, you know what, you're here. At least you are here."" I was not only taken aback by the airlines ability to have broken planes every time I was supposed to board one, or the fact that they kept making me miss my flights, but I was unbelievably astounded at the constant rudeness, unhelpfulness, and overall attitude I received the entire time.",-1

2016-11-01,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DUB to EWR,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,3.0,3,not impressed with the gate staff,False, United Airlines (UA131) from Dublin to Newark proved to be quite an experience. Dublin airport offers pre-clearance and as such I was attracted to the flight with United Airlines. First impressions count and I am afraid that I was not at all impressed with the gate staff – some of whom were in United uniforms and boarded the flight after their gate duties. Their rudeness towards an elderly couple was disgusting and simply ignorant. Boarding was done in groups. Some passengers did not have their groups shown on their tickets and the staff had an aloof manners towards those who simply asked for the process to be explained. One staff member was particularly rude and obnoxious and seemed to enjoy being so. The flight is operated using a Boeing 757. The aircraft is rather comfortable but compact. The safety procedures were taken seriously and a video shown. During this flight I had to contend with an malfunctioning inflight entertainment system. Only a few TVs worked and the sound / volume was not controllable. The journey map did not work properly as only the distances were displayed. The couple next to me gave up on their IFE as theirs’s did not work either. My arm rest was not working correctly either. The catering was good and drinks were served regularly during the flight. I was impressed with the captain who made clear announcements and was very professional and welcoming. The Captain made a point of saying farewell to departing passengers in person. I had to collect my second boarding pass in Newark and the first uniformed United staff member I spoke to was indifferent and made no effort to even speak to me but pointed me along the concourse. The second uniformed United staff member I spoke to get my boarding pass was actually very friendly and polite and informative too. I also had positive impressions of ground staff who operated the transfer bus between terminals and could not praise them enough for being helpful. The price I paid for the ticket was not the cheapest and I think in future I shall try a rival company.,1

Efficient boarding. Second United Airlines service of the day to IAH, so the flight was quite empty (ended up with all three seats in the middle section to myself). The 787 was still very new and presented a very clean and airy cabin, helped by the larger than normal windows and lack of passengers. Comfortable seat with an excellent headrest which folds to support your head, and stays in place. Extremely quiet in terms of cabin noise (engines). Food service was reasonable and wine and beer served for free (premium drinks charged US$7.99 to US$8.99). WiFi worked very well for the entire duration of the flight (US$20 for the duration). Under-seat power supply (2 outlets for 3 seats) and USB charging from the screen. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Constantly walked through the cabin with water. Very pleasant daytime flight. Houston - Sao Paulo: 100% full flight (the norm for Brazil - USA flights). Long delay at the gate with no explanation. Leather type seats which I am not a fan of as they seem to cause you to slip down when sleeping. Headrest folds but does not stay in place. 767 very noisy (probably more because of the fact that I just got off a 787). But a clean cabin and good service. Again a reasonable main meal, good service and flight attendants constantly passing through the cabin with water. Let down by breakfast, only a little sandwich (not great at 0900h after 10 hour in the air).

2016-10-31,0.6,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,IAH to GRU,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,4,let down by breakfast,False," Houston to Sao Paulo with United Airlines. 100% full flight (the norm for Brazil to USA flights). Long delay at the gate with no explanation. Leather type seats which I am not a fan of as they seem to cause you to slip down when sleeping. Headrest folds but does not stay in place. 767 very noisy (probably more because of the fact that I just got off a 787). But a clean cabin and good service. A reasonable meal, good service and flight attendants constantly passing through the cabin with water. Let down by breakfast, only a little sandwich (not great at 0900h after 10 hours in the air).",1

Excellent check-in, completed in 5 minutes by very friendly staff member, including being told the great news that I would not have to pick-up my bags and re-check them for my connecting flight at IAH (which I was told is only done at IAH). Efficient boarding. Second UA service of the day to IAH, so the flight was quite empty (ended up with all 3 seats in the middle section to myself). The 787 was still very new and presented a very clean and airy cabin, helped by the larger than normal windows and lack of passengers. Comfortable seat with an excellent headrest which folds to support your head, and stays in place! Extremely quiet in terms of cabin noise (engines). Food service was reasonable and wine and beer served for free (premium drinks charged US$7.99 to US$8.99). WiFi worked very well for the entire duration of the flight (US$20 for the duration of the flight). Under-seat power supply (2 outlets for 3 seats) and USB charging from the screen. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Constantly walked through the cabin with water. Very pleasant daytime flight.",1

Flying to Honolulu was fine for our honeymoon but getting back home was a nightmare our flight was delayed, so they offered me and my wife coach seats (booked in first class) or wait until 7:20pm when our flight was supposed to take off. At 3:40pm we said we would wait but then they said we would miss the connecting flights so they got us a new flight, but me and my wife would have to sit in different seats - one of us in first class which was what we paid for, and the other in coach.

My seat and eventually flat bed was comfortable and relaxing. The food and drink service was non stop if one wished that. Of course being United, nothing is ever perfect.

Very pleasantly surprised by how good our United Airlines flight was after reading many negative reviews. Flights both ways were on time, nice cabin with great leg room in premium economy.

All things considered, United offer a good business class service for this long-haul flight. Plane left on time and food served promptly after departure. Food quality was fairly good. Movies and IFE were also good. Service was prompt and attentive. Seat reclines flat and allows you to get a good sleep. In terms of full-blown, memorable personalised service, it probably is a little below the level of other airlines. Also, there's some cost cutting aspects which became apparent after a while. I asked for another bowl of nuts some way into the flight and was told ""We're out of nuts."" I asked for a snack and was told that they put out sandwiches and snacks, but only at the half-way point of the journey. So it seemed that they have some limitations, presumably to ensure that the cost per passenger per flight doesn't exceed a certain amount. The seats were good an modern. Possibly not as overly comfortable as some other airlines, though I slept very well on the way back. Wifi was good, when it worked! I have to say that I was generally happy overall. For a business class traveler on business, it did exactly what it needed to do.",1

Only good experiences - both planes quite old but equipped with entertainment sets (short haul paid, long haul was free), with good variety of movies. Seats worn out but comfortable, enough legspace even for tall people. Food - nothing special, but acceptable. Most importantly - super quick and on time boarding, both planes took of on time and landed ahead of schedule. Last, but not least - super nice crew on both flights and in the ground. On top of all that - much cheaper than the competition. Recommended and will fly again.",1

We were seated in the business class section of this plane, although the ground staff referred to our seats as first class. We were in seats 1A and 1B. The male flight attendant on this flight very obviously did not like his job - he never once smiled, never once said thank you, please, your welcome - it was if we were an inconvenience to this man.  I have never in all my years of travel, encountered a more surly flight attendant. Once we arrive to Chicago (we were on route to Toronto) we deplaned the aircraft and went in search of a board to see what our next gate would be - none were immediately available to us and we walked quite a way in terminal 1. I asked a United ground staff person how we get to Toronto and showed her my ticket, and she proceeded to send us to Terminal 5 - which is outside the security area and at the far end of the airport. This required taking the train, walking a fair distance, and once we arrived the ground staff at the entrance to this terminal advised us we needed to return to Terminal 1! Needless to say, we were not happy. Our flight was scheduled to depart 1 hour after we arrived at this airport (Chicago) and when we finally cleared security (again) and made our way back, the flight was already boarded and our overhead bins were full. And we were flying in seat 2b and 2d (I may have the seat numbers incorrect, but you get the idea - we were again in Business class.) This flight was a treat - the flight attendants were very pleasant, and had to deal with my ranting about being sent all over the airport by United ground staff. The flight was uneventful, but much better than the LA to Chicago route. United needs to get their people trained properly. I will not be flying with this airline in future if I can help it.",-1

This would have been my first time flying United Airlines and it will never happen again. Hurricane Matthew is supposed to be hitting the charleston area on Friday night. My flight scheduled of course for first thing saturday morning. The entire city of Charleston is being evacuated. Highways are being reversed in the direction out of Charleston on Wednesday at 3pm. We are forced to leave and as a result, will not be in Charleston to catch this flight. As if being displaced wasnt bad enough, United's ""policy"" will not allow me to change my departure city without paying the fare difference. Flying out of the same city early isn't an option because were being evacuated. Flying after the storm means I miss my sisters wedding. Changing cities is now on me as if im not doing everything i can to make this flight. Unreal. No other airline has ever been this insensitive or unaccomodating.",-1

Check in was difficult because the staff was having trouble with another customer. Fortunately, I did not have any luggage to check, so the self check worked fine. Lunch was horrible. The roast beef sandwich was soggy and tasteless. I also did not receive a receipt and had to call three times to have a receipt for lunch emailed to me, not immediately, but within 10 to 14 business days. No receipt available on board.

There must have been something in the water at the United Airlines employee canteen. Although I'm usually wary of United Airlines because of delays and cancellations, on the three flights I took on this day all were excellent. Well excellent considering it's 2016 and one has years of poor track records with some airlines. At check in Santo Domingo even the manager was checking people in, jovially and with professionalism. Flight departed and arrived on time. The flight Newark - Los Angeles a full flight, but the flight attendants were there with good, cheerful service, with water, beverages, even a decent hot meal for purchase that was better than expected. The leg room in economy plus was adequate in bulkhead seats - overall it gave me hope that United is trying to improve its service and on time performance. Baggage arrived in timely manner - dunno maybe there was something good in the water for passengers too - all flights were A-OK.",1
2016-10-02,0.5,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,MXP to SJO via EWR,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2,flight has been delayed,False,"  Milan to San Jose via Newark. We get to Milano Malpensa to find out that our flight has been delayed 1 hour 40 min due to mechanical problems. The lady at the counter said that since we were arriving to Newark and probably missing our connection to San Jose, Costa Rica she gave us boarding passes for the flight we were ""Supposedly booked on"" , and for the flight the next morning, since the flight we were booked on was in the evening. So, after the 4.5 hours of delay we were finally called to board. The flight was good, and we hoped to find that the flight in the evening got delayed so we didn't have to stay in an airport hotel and hop on the flight the next morning. So, we get to Newark and realize on the United app that our flight to SJO had taken off 2 min before we landed. We passed through security, which took 1 hour 20 min, we went to the counter and asked for a hotel room to spend the night and hop on the flight we had already been booked in for SJO the next morning. The whole flight was in there, trying to do the same as us, so we spent another 2 hrs shouting at the counter lady who didn't want to give us a room. We argued until she did and we suffered a long line before. When we got to the hotel in a shuttle, we noticed this place was old and nasty.",1

It took me 4 hours to finally get to an agent who took time to listen to my concern. I accidentally clicked on Cancel instead of Change and called them immediately to help me with the situation. But instead of helping me, they told straight that it will be additional $300 change fee (the previous consultant told me was $200 only). I was on call with them for 1.5 hours - out of which I talked for only 20 minutes hardly and they had be on hold for the rest of the time. Accidents like this happen, the airline could have helped me out, but that was not the case.  I don't have an option to get out as I dont want to lose so much money which I already paid.",-1

2016-09-28,0.9,Business,Economy Class,CLE to SAN via ORD,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,cabin crew remains helpful and courteous,False,"  I fly only a couple of times per year. Over the last 5 to 10 years, that has been split between Southwest and United. That's now tipping in favor of United. The big difference is boarding. On United, even if I board the plane last, the seat that I chose online is waiting for me. On both airlines the overhead bins are a problem. But, that is not the airlines, it is the inconsiderate passengers, who drag over-sized bags, or too many bags onto the plane. The cabin crew remains helpful and courteous. How long would you last dealing with what you see on airplanes these days? I left a Samsung tablet in the seat packet. I figured that was gone. But no, the clean-up crew found it, and they called my cell phone: ""We have your tablet"". That says a lot. I am flying United, whenever I can.",1
2016-09-27,0.3,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LEX to LHR via ORD,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,4.0,2,was old and tattered,False,"  My daughter and I flew to Heathrow from Lexington and our first flight via Chicago went well. Plane departed and arrived on time. Unfortunately, the next leg of the trip wasn't as good. We sat in the plane in the heat for over an our before the plane departed. Once we were in the air, I took off my shoes and unfortunately slipped on the plastic runner under my seat and broke my toe on the seat in front of me. I mentioned it to the flight attendant who said I could have a wheelchair waiting for me at the gate in Heathrow - I declined as I felt I needed to at least try to walk, this was the beginning of my vacation with my daughter. The next thing that happened was that my special food order (gluten free) wasn't available. They said they never got the order although I had specially made the order on-line before my flight. I had to make do with another meal and the same with breakfast. The exact same thing happened on my return flight to the U.S. even though I'd made sure the order was done on-line once again. On the return flight, the flight attendant went to first class to get me some fruit and cheese. The plane was so old and tattered (both ways), the bathroom had ashtrays inside. The entertainment was non-existent with a tiny screen on the seat in from about the size of two decks of cards. All of the movies started at the same time so we were unable to choose anything that hadn't already started. Even if I'd been able to choose something, it would have been impossible to hear as the plane was so loud that my ears were buzzing long after the flight. Everything was old and tattered. What has made me even more irritated is that I received an email asking me to rate my journey (both ways). I mentioned these things and haven't heard a word from United. The reason I've given this review three stars instead of one is that three of our four flights were reasonably on-time with no lost luggage.",-1
2016-09-26,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,HNL to MEM via IAH,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,fail to inform about delays,False," Honolulu to Memphis via Houston with United Airlines. The worst flight experience I've had in a long while. First, the charging plugs on my entire row was not working. All the flight attendants said was ""oh I'm sorry, I'll write it up."" I had to press the issue until I was given an alternative to getting my devices charged. The next thing was discovered when we landed in Houston, was that we was not going to make our connection to Memphis. So we was directed to customer service. We were given a later flight, but they failed to inform us that that flight was delayed as well. We found it out while on our way to our gate, by text message. They knew that that flight was delayed long before we got our flight rebooked. They allow flights to be booked too close together so there is no way the connection can be made. And they fail to inform people about delays until the last second. Then all they can say is ""I'm sorry"" So empty, so sad. Now if we do not comply with their rules and schedules, they can decline our flight, without refund. Now how is that fair? They can mess up in every way and nothing is done except to say ""I'm sorry."" Not a happy camper - all my plans have been changed due to United Airlines messing up.",-1

Its a 3 hour flight and prior to boarding the gate agent reminded everyone to download the app before heading on board. Terminal has free wifi so it was slow to download but achievable, Once you have the app you could use the in-flight entertainment on your BYOD for free. There was movies and TV shows, limited choice but enough to fill the 3 hours in. Cabin crew were friendly with 2 drink services and one pre packet cookie. Like always flight was full and they asked for volunteers to check baggage first before stopping others. Gate agent was friendly and was given a exit row window seat. Nice bonus really. Baggage re claim was okay considering all the incoming flights.",1

Just the worst round trip ever. 6:30 am departure cancelled and have to route through SFO at 8:55. Arrived in Chicago at 9pm, a good 8 hours late. Coming back, flight delayed from 12:20pm to 1:40, then to 4:05, then 6:30. Tracking the planes flight - it was coming from Providence, RI and would have been impossible to make the 1:20. They like to slow play the delays on you. One thing is that the App is very helpful keeping track of delays, cancellations and gate changes. Which is the only thing that is for sure. Boarded the plane and waited over an hour for pilots! No air con, no wash water in the toilets. Just the most poorly managed airline out there. Could be Chicago O'Hare in general, but see lots of other planes coming and going so don't think so.",-1
2016-09-21,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to CUN via SFO,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,a vacation from hell,False,"  Los Angeles to San Francisco to Cancun. I will never fly with them again. It was my first and definitely my last time. I was 8 hours early to my flight and when I got to my destination my baggage was not there. I filed a report and they told me that my luggage is still in San Francisco! I waited over 24 hours for them to bring me my luggage. I was told by phone that I could purchase a couple of things that I needed for a maximum of $100 dollars until my luggage arrives and that I would be reimbursed once I sent them a receipt of what I purchased (along with a couple of forms). I went ahead and bought a swimming suit and a shirt. All together my total was $65. It's been a month later and they haven't got back to me! I called them over 5 times and have emailed them with all the forms they wanted 4 times. If you need to call their 1800 number don't even bother, they are unhelpful and inturrupt you before you finish your sentence. Also my luggage was 56 pounds on the way back and they charged me $168 dollars for it. I get home and check my statement online and I notice that they charged me $168 twice instead of once. Overall this has been a vacation from hell. I encourage you to spend the extra money and fly with an airline that cares about their costumers.",-1

I am not particularly picky when it comes to flying, because I have flown a lot. I had to review United Airlines, though because of how bad of a trip this airline caused me. The flight attendants were rude and completely inappropriate. One attendant shouted at a little girl for tapping her because she needed a drink. If you are in group 5 when boarding, you can kiss any overhead space goodbye because it will be gone and you will have to check your luggage. This has happened to me every time I had flown with United which is at least 5 times. Yes, the tickets are cheaper, but you might as well pay a little more for a better experience.",-1

I have been flying United twice a week for business. United never seems to be proactive to check their carry on bags, so a group of people typically has to deboard the plane to go up and check their bags. Usually they have two extremes where they check everyone's or no ones. Let's standardize, United. During this flight, people asked to check their bag and the boarding lady denied them, causing a big back up. She seemed clueless and new without any help. When I got on the plane after I checked my bag, people were still trying to leave the plane to check their bag. The flight attendant yelled at me to slide into a seat when I got to my row and already asked my seat mates if I could get to my window seat. The flight attendant then gave me a dirty look-exactly how I wanted to start my morning. I just hope my return flight leaves on time, which is only on time 40% of the time (source: United.com). I have been thinking about matching my status to Delta because United has not lived up to its friendly airlines motto.",-1

My first flight from Monterey to San Francisco was delayed due to fog which is completely understandable. The attendant in Monterey did an amazing job rerouting my flight and giving me back up options. However, when I got to SFO, it was a different story. The connecting flight did not make it in on time so I needed to reschedule yet again. The staff member at the customer service desk was incredibly unprofessional. They were telling jokes and speaking in a different language on their cell phone while they were with customers, and we're just downright inattentive. The customer service in SFO was terrible. Luckily the flights went smoothly from there on out, but my experience in SFO was absolutely terrible.",-1

The United Airlines flight from Nashville to Houston was delayed almost 40 minutes due to a mechanical issue. My connection in Houston originally was about 50 minutes. I barely made my connection for my flight to Los Angeles so did not expect my luggage to be on my flight. I was amazed that my luggage was transferred so quickly. I would recommend no reclining seats. Passengers may not realize how confined the passengers behind are when they reduce the already small space by reclining. Maybe an announcement could be made to be courteous to fellow passengers.",1

I knew most US based airlines were not good from several past experiences, but this time United went far below any expectations. Boarded a plane that the crew knew had a problem, and had to unboard after they could not fix the problem. - This because these planes look old, worn out and not appealling, or reassuing to fly. - Had no certaintiy whether flight would be canceled or not until 3 hours after initial take off time. Got rerouted and was not given option to take earlier connection which had a 1h40 mns transit time. Instead, I was given a connection time in Heathrow of 4.5 hours! Little details like your meal choice cannot be satisfied as they do not board enough meals to give people a real choice. When I complained about this to the hostess, I got a cold answer: ""How would we do business if we board more meals than passengers to give everyone in business class a choice?"". I answered her back: ""well, may be you should ask all the other airlines I fly how they do it: European, Asian, Middle Eastern"". I have a senator status with Star alliance, supposed to be a valued customer. The worst airline experience - I highly discourage everyone from flying, and I obviously will never fly again.",-1
2016-09-16,1.0,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AUS to EWR,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,nice customer service,False,"  I actually am very happy with UA. I bought roundtrip tickets non-stop in July, for $199 from NYC to Austin and back. The flight there was on-time, offered in-flight movies and shows and internet access for additional cost. I couldn't get the movies to work on my laptop, but after downloading their UA app it worked fine on my android. The flight had 2 complimentary drinks, ranging from water to random juices, and a little snack. You could buy additional drinks and food if you wanted, all prices were transparent and pretty fair. The main reason why I'm writing this review is because of my flight back. I ended up being on-time but because of the TSA check point I missed my flight. The flight left exactly when it had to, and it was my fault for not arriving earlier.  I called the UA phone, the lady found me a connecting flight through houston to NYC the following day. Free of charge, not the best option, but I'll take it. I ended up stopping by the front-desk so to speak of the UA before leaving the airport just to double-check. They lady at the desk found me a connecting flight that leaves in 20mins time, and because i'm a tall guy (6'4"") she even gave me isle seats! I ended up getting an economy plus isle seat to houston and a normal economy isle seat to NYC, which was sold out and overbooked, but I still got on. Anyway, I'm very happy. No charge, next-flight out, I ended up getting back home a day earlier than I technically should've, because of nice customer service! The flight was great, amenities were great, and the price! $199 roundtrip, you can't beat that!",1

Upon boarding I was greeted and asked if I wanted my coat hung. As soon as I sat down in seat 2A I was offered a beverage. Inflight service and food were great. Dinner was a Turbot with 2 prawns in a lobster sauce with lentils. I never order fish on a plane and this dinner was delicious. Cocktails and Wine were served in stem glasses,. Pillow was comfy but the duvet was just ok. The purser and flight attendant were on their game the entire flight.  I flew in Business from Vancouver to Houston to connect to this flight. The flight to Houston was horrible. I was in 3A on an A320. No entertainment system or cabin screens. No pillow and the blanket was like a kleenex. And this was a 4 hour flight. Food horrible but the service was good. I will never fly United within the USA.",1
2016-09-12,0.1,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to EWR,2.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,complete lack of professionalism,False,"  Our flight, 415 United, supposed to leave at 11:15 pm from LA to Newark, was the worst flight experience I have had and I am appalled at how United handled this. We first waited 25 minutes outside in the dark to go through security due to the construction. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours. There were no seats at the gate since there were multiple United flights that were delayed. Later our gate was changed with no announcement from 74 to 72. When we asked an United employee at the first gate, she had no idea which gate was correct. It was finally determined gate 72 was the correct gate. When we went over to gate 72, there were no lights and they were completing construction with drilling, jack-hammering, and shouting right next to us. It was extremely loud, we were sitting in the dark, with no United employee in sight. Our flight, initially delayed to 1:15 am continued to get pushed back. When I went to use the restroom before our flight, the restrooms were disgusting. When an United employee finally came to our gate and I expressed my concern that not only were we severely delayed and sitting in the dark with an absurd noise level, but now there weren't even restroom facilities available, she told me there was nothing she could do and dismissed me. Due to United's delay, our arranged transportation home from the Newark airport had to be adjusted causing significant inconvenience.  I could not believe the lack of communication, unsanitary conditions, disorganization, and the complete lack of professionalism we experienced from United. It was the worst experience and a complete disgrace at the end of our honeymoon.",-1

The IFE screen was an appropriate size, the system offered more than fifteen languages, and selection of movies was good.

Literally every time I fly United it is the worst flight experience. Not only are their planes horribly outdated, but the staff and flight attendants are rude. I flying to be at a wedding this weekend and I'm horribly sick. I asked a flight attendant for help lifting my carry on bag and she rudely said if I couldn't lift it myself I'd have to go back and check it because lifting baggage isn't her job. I politely told her I'd take care of it. But seriously, where is the excellent customer service and just general kindness anymore?

I spoke to one of the customer service representative who informed me that this is what happens when the flight is oversold and that they will assign me a seat at the gate. She also said that the only seats available are middle seats. It is the first time something like this happened to me and I was really shocked, especially when buying the ticket I requested for a window seat. Does that mean that request are then being ignored, the company oversells flights and does not care about their customers (while flying 11 hours)? Well, that's how it looks like.",-1

Terrible at keeping flights on time or listening to customers. I came four hours before my flight, I was going to work from the airport. When I arrived at the airport I received an email saying my flight was delayed, this delay was going to make catching my connecting flight very unlikely. I approached the counter and told the woman of my concerns, if there was a flight I could catch sooner, fly to a different hub, etc. she said I would be fine. My reply was that if the flight was delayed even 1 more minute I would miss my connection. 4 hours later were supposed to start boarding and I get a new notification saying my flight was delayed another hour. I was going to miss my connection. I approached the desk, there were now no more flights that could get me to my destination, none even in the same state as my destination! So I had to rebook for two days later. I wasted my PTO of two days, shortening my vacation, wasted money on cab fares to and from my house and back for my next flight, they don't reimburse and just frustration that they couldn't be proactive in the situation to find a solution. So here I am two days later, didn't get to choose my seat, I'm checking in and notice there are aisle seats further up than mine that are open and I ask the woman at the desk to please change my seat. She said to do that at the gate. By the time I got through security and up to the gate all those seats were gone. More frustration. One small change could have improved today but the lack of care and sense of urgency from the United team has made my respect for the company vanish. They don't care how you feel, they don't care about your time, your money, your enjoyment of their services. Somewhere along the way they must have forgotten it's their customers who make them.",-1

Check in was a bit awkward as they have self-checkin terminals even for First Class. We needed assistance as I wanted to change my FF card and this took some time as not all agents seem to know what to do. Boarding was on-time. Seats absolutely OK with fine recline and space. Plane was full in First and Coach. Due to some issues with baggage flight was boarded but delayed by nearly 1 hour. Captain updated us frequently on the procedure which was very much appreciated. Crew over all very friendly and attentive. My expectations on food were low reading all the bad reviews about United - but I was positively surprised. We got salmon and this was absolutely fine. On my next trip to US I will for sure fly United again - and invest the extra money for First as this might be the difference.,1

2016-08-22,0.8,Business,Business Class,IAD to BCN,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4,offers great value for money,False,"  Washington to Barcelona with United. It is generally true for United that things were better in pre-Continental merger but it all ain't that bad either. I have flown the B767-400ER and B777 on several transatlantic routes this summer in both classes. I was surprised at how much more comfortable the B764 was as compared to the B777. The B777 felt packed (3-3-3 configuration in coach and awkward backward facing seats in business), while the B764 felt very spacious, clean and modern (2-3-2 in coach and 2-1-2 in business, all forward facing and not too many seats, so quieter). There were also no bothersome IFE equipment boxes under the window seats in coach. I would recommend searching routes that operate the B764 over the B777 - I really believe it is superior in terms of cabin layout and passenger comfort. BusinessFirst very comfortable flat bed seats (I am 179cm). Food quality ok, the main course was very good (beef with steamed vegetables) as well as the cheese and desert (nice detail they cut the cheese at your seat, so it feels fresh). The starter salad was very uncreative and plain bad actually, and no olive oil option as a dressing. But OK, it's an US airline so just don't expect any proper food to come out of that. Food in coach was also good with 3 separate serving rounds for appetiser, meal and desert+coffee. Great idea to hand out water bottles before the sleeping phase of the flight. Next time I will opt for the express dining option in business, as the full dining service takes so much time that you have little left for sleeping. Some people argue the seat configuration in business should be 1-2-1 rather than 2-1-2, but I disagree, while 1-2-1 is perfect for solo business travelers as everyone has isle access, I feel that when traveling with my partner (or any other person) I want to sit together by the window, so 2-1-2 does make sense to me. The business experience in United may not be up to the standards of European and Asian carriers, but (at least on my flights) you also pay less, so I think it offers great value for money. Would fly in United BusinessFirst again, but preferably on the B764.",1

I have clearly indicated that my mileage are to be credited to Kris Flyer account and it is printed on my boarding pass.

This was one of my leisure travels where I was traveling with family and a younger sibling. BusinessFirst"" does consist of nice lie flat beds, you can lie flat and sleep for the most part; as well as the meals being consistently nice. This is something that I can say that United has done well over the past few years. As for the negatives. The businessfirst cabin is cramped.  Cram as many people together as close together to the point you can't but help to stare at your neighbors. Economy plus has a little bit more legroom but hardly worth the extra money if you have to pay for it. This older 767 has dated IFE, screens that are 4 inches wide and may you be lucky if they work. Seats in Econ+ are old, and often broken and hindered in legroom by the IFE boxes. That being said there is extreme value in the price of a UA ticket. The tickets are often $200 cheaper than competing airlines. Furthermore the cabins are grungy, dirty and not clean. You notice a felling of stale air and dirt the second you come into the cabin. I flew with my sibling who is a minor, very much a minor as he is still in elementary school. He was booked in United Economy on an award ticket, I in United Businessfirst paid. I asked the United Agents at checkin if he could sit with me in the business cabin as there where plenty of seats in the cabin still available. I was declined  because of the ""scarcity"" of meals  and asked once again when boarded if he could take an empty seat. The purser was kind enough to ask and with some humiliation, when I pressed him for an answer, he answered that there were not enough seats. As for experience onboard with the staff, it can vary 50/50. Staff are usually quite friendly in the business cabin; but this can also be a polar opposite with glaring stares, cold shoulder treatment and curt responses. Delays on United are not a surprise, they are the rule. I have missed countless engagements, meetings etc because of United's inability to stick to schedule. Again this flight was no different. We boarded, and were advised there was a faulty fresh water valve failure. We were on board for 1 hour before the pursers and FAs advised us to deplane and wait outside whilst they resolved the issue or found a resolution. I went to sit in the Global First Lounge - every other lounge that I've been to is nicer - to await the resolution. Another 3 hours progresses before we are able to board another plane (aircraft swap) to continue on our way to Amsterdam. Albeit this isn't the most disappointing trip I've made with United, the narrative does become a golden rule to flying with United. Hope this helps others make informed choice.",1

A mixed bag like all big American carriers. Boeing 747 on outbound flight was worn and outdated without ptv (it's 2016!). You can connect via wifi to the UA-app to view movies, but this app doesn't work on Android tablets (fix it UA!), so you have to use your phonescreen. App wasn't working at all the first hour. Legroom bad, food and drinks okay and adequate, American crew very informal. They didn't even bother about the uniforms, because a woman whom I thought was a passenger turned out to be a flight attendant. Inbound flight in Boeing 777 with ptv which also didn't work for the first hour. Promised wifi didn't work at all. Mainly UK based rather cold crew. Food and drinks again okay. Both flights punctual. All in all: UA is certainly not on par with Asian and Middle Eastern airlines - no amenities kit in economy for example- so I would avoid if you have a choice.",-1

We have never experienced such a bad quality of service. After boarding a plane and been ready to take off at 8:25 pm, we had the announcement informing us that we had to go back to the gate due to a computer problem in order for the technicians to fix it. After getting the OK from maintenance, the plane was pushed back, but it stopped a few moments later. After another 30 minutes waiting, we got the announcement from the cabin telling us that the plane had to go back to the terminal because of the same problem. Back at the gate we were told to disembark and take all our belongings because it would take at least a couple of hours to fix the problem. A few minutes later the crew starts leaving the plane and we asked why? The lady says: nobody told you yet? The plane is only leaving at 7:00 am because the crew already used the hours and the pilot can't fly the plane. Then the announcement comes from the counter, but they also tell us that there are no hotels in the area to take everybody, so we will have to stay in the terminal.  What about food? A $10 voucher when a sandwich costs $9:99. The night was over. Let's board again and be on the way to Lisbon. We had to wait for another 2 hours, in the plane, for the paperwork from maintenance to clear the work that had been done overnight. We finally took off at 9:30 am, 12 hours later. Just out of curiosity: United claims to be one of the biggest airlines and doesn't have another plane and a crew on standby to respond to this kind of situations? We didn't see one single supervisor in 12 hours.",-1
2016-08-19,0.9,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,LAX to HNL,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,5,they are headed in the right direction,False,"  Flew from Los Angeles to Honolulu on a family vacation. Boarding was surprisingly quick for such a large plane. The staff that greeted us were very polite and pointed us towards our seats. The plane did not have any monitors but was fittied with wifi. Only issue with the wifi is that it doesn't work over the pacific so doesn't matter. This isn't United's fault but with the wifi provider. There was no food offered on this flight but got the stroopwafel and drinks. I love the waffel so I didn't complain and asked for one more. We were also given a blanket which was nice because the plane did get a bit chilly as our flight was early morning. Once, we took off the flight was bump free and smooth as it got. I have been on many flights and have done this flight numerous times with many airlines. This flight had to be the smoothest I have been on. Overall the only thing I wish they had was actual food on the flight and working wifi but the latter cant be blamed on United. Hawiian Airlines does offer food from LA to HNL so I wish that was offered. Other than that United has been trying hard to please their customers and I think they are headed in the right direction.",1

2016-08-18,0.2,Couple Leisure,Business Class,EWR to SYD via SFO,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,1,you couldn’t make this stuff up,False,"  My wife and I have just returned from a trip to the USA (Newark to Sydney via San Francisco) flying United Airlines business class. We’ve flown a lot over the years but have never experienced an airline service quite as bad as this one. After a long flight from Sydney we faced a 6-hour delay in San Francisco awaiting a connection to Chicago. At one point we boarded a plane and were preparing for take-off. The plane was actually waiting on the runway for the go ahead to fly. Astoundingly, we get a cabin announcement informing us that we were to be taken back to the terminal as the pilot had gone over his assigned ‘flight hours’ and couldn’t fly the plane. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Confusion reigned for the next few hours while United staff gave conflicting information. Firstly, we were told to stay on the plane and wait for a replacement pilot. We were then told we’d need to disembark. One said we'd definitely be flying that day while another said we might not as they might not be able to get a pilot. Eventually, a pilot did arrive and we did fly out that day. Unfortunately, the return leg didn’t improve. We were scheduled to fly from Newark airport to San Fran where we would catch another flight to Sydney. As time was tight between when the flight from Newark was due to arrive and our connection from San Fran was due to depart, we decided to arrive at Newark airport early to see if we could change to an earlier flight. We were told by a rather surly United staff member that all earlier flights were fully booked. Strangely – when I checked my baggage in, the check in screen told me that for $75.00 I could take an earlier flight. After passing security, we decided to go to the United lounge and ask service staff about any other options for taking an earlier flight. When staff saw the tight connection time between the two flights they were in disbelief. They told us that this was an illegal connection and we should not have been able to even book it. They then offered to put us on standby and as it happened, we were able to get an earlier flight. On arrival at San Fran, my wife noted that an email had been sent to her from her work. When we hadn’t boarded our ‘booked’ flight from Newark our flight from San Francisco to Sydney had been cancelled. Service staff confirmed this and notified that our booked seats had already been sold and we might not be able to get seats on the flight. We were eventually assigned new seats but we might as well have saved our money and gone economy. Passengers were walking through the cabin all night and we had to put up with a screaming baby and the stench of diaper changes. The service was woeful and I’ve had better in economy on other airlines. Our seats hadn’t been cleaned properly - there was rubbish and the screen control device was so sticky and dirty my wife had to wipe it down herself. Finally, when we arrived in Sydney we went to the baggage claim. After waiting an hour for our baggage we decided to check where it might be. Surprise, our baggage was still in San Fran. This despite asking United staff numerous times that our luggage was on the flights and receiving their full assurances. The service person in Sydney noted it was a common occurrence with United. When we turned around there was a line of United customers with the same issue. I realise others have had far worse flight experience, but ours wasn’t great. You come away with the feeling that the dollar is definitely a priority over the customer.",-1

I understand weather related issues and the 1 hr delay but once again the communication with United is just terrible and don’t get me started on the attitude from the United personnel. They kept us on the plane for more than 1 hour because they couldn’t move the gate bridge and maintenance was working on it. After weather and Gate Bridge delays, we left 140 minutes late but the problem is that 40 minutes after takeoff, pilot announcement was extremely disconcerting. “Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a problem because we are getting some warning signs and the Autopilot doesn’t work so we will have to get back to the closest mayor airport but we will not declare any emergency”. Once again having problems, I don’t know if it’s just me that I travel too much or just bad luck. Unfortunately I have had more and more issues with United and for once I realize status doesn’t mean anything as some United representatives are rude and disrespectful and they can’t resolve problems. I guess I didn’t get any compensation because I decided to cancel my trip as I was only going to be in Brazil for 36 hrs after all of this issue. I had 3 customers by themselves in Brazil and this was really costly to the company but I guess United doesn’t really care about it. If this was a onetime thing, from time to time, it would be fine, but its almost every international overseas flight a take (7-8 a year) and then, several domestics as well.",-1

This airline is uniformly dire and I question why Air NZ places its passengers on this carrier if not for Star Alliance. In same league as Air China, which is also Star Alliance. On the plus side, my bags made it from NZ to Ottawa. Now for the negatives: overbooked cramped flights (offered usd 400 and usd 150 on both flights to take later flight - no thanks). Service with a snarl. Thanks to unexplained delays at Newark, my trip became 26 hr ordeal rather than a 23 hr ordeal. Zero service on the late night flight to Ottawa (like I said, just glad my bags arrived). Star Alliance should enforce minimum quality standards amongst ifs members. Clearly there is a disconnect.",-1
2016-08-13,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BWI to LAX via ORD,1.0,,3.0,,,1.0,1,one of the worst travel experiences,False,  Baltimore to Los Angeles via Chicago. This was one of the worst travel experiences of my life. They overbooked the first flight by 19 people and even though I was in group 2 for boarding did not give me a seat number forcing me to be the last on the plane and making me check my bag due to there being no storage space. Once we arrived in Chicago we were out on a very old dated plane with torn seats. We they say for hours as they tried to out safety signs onto one of the doors. They for some reason did not have these signs and stickers in stock so they had to manufacture them. Completely unacceptable. The cherry on top being the rude agents working the gate area that could not be bothered to answer simple questions or do anything but okay on their cell phones.,-1

The aircraft was an Embraer 175, it was not that comfortable for an almost 3 hour flight from Newark (EWR) to Memphis (MEM). They did serve some types of soft drinks, juice and water for free, but if someone wanted a beer, it was expensive (7.99 USD). The cabin was ok and quite clean, but not up to the standards I am used to. The crew were anyway polite and efficient.",1

For some reason, I was not assigned TSA PRE on this flight even though I am Global Entry, but I was accomodated in the First Class/Premier Access line (Atlanta doesn't have an official United Premier line. United Club was nice and cozy. It is much newer than other United lounge. Boarding process smooth, I showed up just as the last First Class/Group 1 passengers were boarding so I walked right in. Plane was new and modern. Seats were extremely spacious, food was good, and the DirectTV displays were free in United First. Overall, great experience.",1
2016-08-08,0.7,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SAP to DEN via IAH,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4,seats themselves were comfortable,False,"  San Pedro Sula to Denver via Houston. Having other negative experiences with United, I was generally satisfied with this trip. This was the cheapest option for my trip, and had the best connection times. On the way down to Honduras, there was no issues except that the personal in-flight entertainment wasn't working for some of the flight down to Houston, which wasn't a big deal because I brought myself plenty of things to do. Both the flights from Denver and Houston left on time, and the flight from Denver arrived a little early. Coming back wasn't quite as smooth. I checked in online and printed boarding passes from the hotel's computer rather than doing it at the airport. However, the airport staff in San Pedro Sula wanted the version printed from the airport (not United's fault). What my biggest gripe is that once I get to the ticket counter, I am rudely told that since I already have a boarding pass, they can't print me another one. Luckily, I was able to eventually get to the secure part of the airport. Then when I am trying to board, the ground service rejects the boarding pass which I printed off of the United website, and almost wouldn't let me board. After a few minutes of verification, they finally let me board, but first give me a lecture about ""not having a boarding pass"". Overall, all the flights were fine. The cabin crew were all very friendly, and since I have the United App, I could access the personal entertainment, which had a good selection of movies. They offered drinks, and the service was done very quickly. The legroom was a little tight, but the seats themselves were comfortable and the airplane was clean. With the exception of ground service in San Pedro Sula, I was satisfied with the airline. I may consider using them in the future.",1
2016-08-08,0.8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to LHR,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,food was excellent,False," Flew round-trip between Los Angeles and London Heathrow on United Airlines. Check-in was smooth via self-serve kiosks in L.A. and London. Security screening was efficient in both airports as well. Food was excellent. On-board Wi-fi helped me stay connected with loved ones. The power outlet on B777-200 is located underneath the seat and is a bit awkward to reach. Having tried power outlets on multiple airlines, they tend to be unreliable (ie, sometimes there is no power coming through the outlet). On the flight from L.A. to London, there was an incident where water was dripping from the ceiling and passengers were very concerned. The issue was resolved without any impact on flight schedule.",1

2016-08-06,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to EWR,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1,flights are without infotainment,False,"  Tucson to Ottawa via Newark. Although the aircraft is relatively new, the sardine layout makes it feel very cramped. At the end, it took 15-20 min for the exiting line to reach rows 32-34. It is that difficult to exit as the middle and window seats are unable to get ready at all. More annoying however, the 3-4 hr flights are without infotainment, except the one you pay via WIFI. Considering that UA dropped me and many others, on connecting flights that commence boarding 5-10 minutes before landing, it is obvious that you have no time whatsoever to charge devices - not if going from UA to UA flight. Besides the lack of USB or any other ports, they want you to download their own apps and software, and hopefully be sucked into an UA wifi spending spree. Food? What food? There was water at some point. Given the narrow lane and 3x3, yes it took 60 min for the water cart to make it midway.",-1

Then the two United Airlines employees realized and felt the need to split the lines into a ""Denver"" only route and ""non-Denver."" We had started -3h check in, we were 1h20 from flight and still had not cleared check in! It is as if deliberate to be slow. Eventually, a short rush and was through. Take off was punctual, staff was efficient, but aircraft a complete disappointment. 5 hrs of flight in two legs, no entertainment and no food - Welcome to the 'new United,' where no expense is wasted.

A complete unprofessional airline provider that is not trustworthy. Waited more that 5 hours and they kept moving the departure time 1 hour at the time. Was supposed to leave LAX at 5.45pm. First delay was set to 10pm then 10.15pm then 11.15pm and they don't help at all. They give you a 10$ voucher and tell you to go buy a meal.

Changed from Aer Lingus to United as my main Dublin to US airline because of a couple of mess ups in my seats the last few times travelling with them. This trip was the first time me flying business with United. Had no issues very well treated on the flight, had lie-down beds so I slept for 4 hours of the 7-hour flight the other 3 hours were usually having a lovely 5-course meal provided. The amenities in business were fantastic too. Boarding was very quick it was not a hugely busy flight business class had about 9/16 seats taken. The only thing I dislike is they did not offer free wifi to their business customers! Overall they're my new favourite airline to fly with.",1

Flight from SHV to IAH on ERJ-135 was overbooked. They asked for a volunteer to give up seat. First offer was for $500, but no one took it. When United raised the offer to $600, I volunteered to give up my seat. After a few minutes of processing my request, United told me that I wouldn't have to give up my seat, but they upgraded me to Premium Economy for my next segment on Airbus 319 from Houston to Orange County. The extra leg room in Premium Economy was a welcome addition to my journey. Unfortunately, one of the bathrooms in A319 wasn't working, so Premium Economy passengers were allowed to use the bathroom for 1st class passengers.",1
2016-07-24,0.4,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SNA to SFO,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,3.0,3,a short one hour flight,False,"  Flew United Airlines round-trip between Orange County - San Francisco during 4th of July weekend. Flight from Orange County was delayed, but the automated text messages by United on my phone kept me updated. Boarding on ERJ-175 was done from a gate that did not use the Jet Bridge. The jet-engine noise inside ERJ-175 cabin was significantly louder than what I am used to on other domestic flights, but thankfully, it was a short one hour flight. Since I was seated in the rear of the aircraft, the plane had started its descent by the time beverage service came around.",-1

2016-07-22,0.1,Business,Economy Class,LGA to ORD,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no explanation given,False,"  I have flown United Airlines several times, and they have shown incredible consistency in being the absolutely worst airline. My negative experiences with the airline date back to 2007. As for the present trip under review from New York LaGuardia to Chicago, here are the most relevant issues. First, the flight was delayed leaving the airport by over two hours. There was no explanation given for what led to the delay while we waited at the gate. Second, the space between seats is simply unfairly small. I am a 5' 10"" man who is not at all overweight. And yet, my knees were pressed firmly against the seat in front of me, and the space was so small that I could not open my laptop computer to do work on the flight (my laptop is a MacBook Air, the thinnest model). Third, once in Chicago airspace we were told we could not land and circled the airport for close to an hour. When it finally appeared that we were going to land, the landing was aborted at the very last moment and were re-routed to Detroit. The problem: no information was given that we were heading there, just a little surprise when we arrived at a different airport. Upon exiting the plane, there were no gate agents there to help with booking connecting flights, only the personnel who dealt with lost luggage. I could actually say more negative things about this flight but am limited by space. Suffice it to say that I will absolutely never fly United again unless they are literally the only option in getting to my destination city. I would happily pay double to avoid getting on a United flight.",-1

2016-07-21,0.1,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,SMF to EWR via ORD,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,never fly United Airlines again,False,"  Having flown on many different airlines whilst travelling over the years, my family and I decided to opt for a little more comfort while taking an overnight flight from Sacramento to Newark via O'Hare. It turned out that economy plus on United Airlines is a scam to make you pay more money for very little else. We ended up having to pay for checking in bags, the seats were uncomfortable and the added 'leg room' was laughable. I had some box under the seat in front of me that meant i had to move my feet to the left for the flight, very uncomfortable. Staff on the flight were not interested in the economy plus / economy cattle behind the curtain and I was told a flat no when i asked if they had a spare blanket for my son who was freezing. I would never fly United Airlines again, save your money and book another airline that have genuine perks and benefits for your money.",-1
2016-07-21,0.5,Solo Leisure,Business Class,JFK to LAX,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,,3.0,5,lot of space for improvement,False,"  The United flight 841 from New York JFK to Los Angeles in August 2015 was a so called ""premium service"" one and the flown class was branded as ""BusinessFirst"". Thus led to high expectations which were not met at all. After an efficient boarding process the first disappointments. The cabin made an outdated impression and signs of abrasion were found everywhere; cables fixed with tape, worn armrests and not working lights were just a few of them. The cabin staff was split half-in-half: 50 per cent were very friendly and seemed to care about passengers, however, the other half behaved like their job is a tremendous burden for them and customers seen as a factor of distress. The selection of food found in the menu was good but the quality of the served meals was bluntly put an impertinence; especially the meat was flavourless and rubber-like. The beverages were much better, though the coffee was another letdown. On the positve side, the IFE was very easy to handle and the provided films, games, and music covering a broad palette of tastes. In addition, the price-performance-ratio was straight. Overall it can be stated that there is a lot of space for improvement.",1
2016-07-19,0.8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,EWR to BHX,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,4.0,5,the staff were fantastic,False,"  I have flown United once before and swore never again, however I had heard they had improved so gave them another go flying from Newark to Birmingham, UK. I was pleasantly surprised the check in staff were helpful and we just sailed through. Yes we were delayed but what could United do about a thunderstorm. Communication about gate changes and the delay could have been much better, but once we boarded the plane the staff were fantastic. The only thing that let down the whole experience was the food at Newark International Airport. It is disgusting and this is from someone who will eat anything and not complain. We had heard it was bad but did not believe it, believe everything you hear and eat before you arrive. The only saving grace is that there is a Starbucks, which is about the worst I have been to all over the world, but better than anything else we found in the six hours we spent at this airport.",1

2016-07-17,0.6,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,ORD to GRU,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,4,"competent, reliable service",False,"  Chicago to Sao Paulo. I fly United a lot, because I live in Chicago and have the opportunity to collect miles and other benefits. Generally, I've been satisfied with this arrangement. I'm not unrealistic about United - you definitely don't get the small luxuries that Asian and some European airlines provide, but United generally provides competent, reliable service, and most staff members are reasonably friendly. Recent flights to and from GRU were par for the course. The flights were on time. Staff were efficient. The economy plus seats were fine. The small screens on the 767s are pretty bad, but I understand why it might not be worth updating them. I don't eat meat and have learned that ""Asian vegetarian"" tends to be better quality than regular vegetarian. The ""Asian vegetarian"" suppers were reasonable in both directions, although there was nothing at all Asian about the GRU to ORD supper (soy burgers plus rice and vegetables). The ORD to GRU supper was quite good and (except maybe for the curried tofu) quite South Asian. It even came with plain yogurt. However, United should be embarrassed by the breakfasts (in both directions), which consisted entirely of a stale roll and a tiny package of jam. People who didn't request a special meal got a croissant and a sweetened yogurt, which would have been just as ""Asian vegetarian"" as what I did get. My seatmate who (unlike me) is actually South Asian was just furious. This is the sort of thing that undermines United's improving reputation. Asian and most European airlines are much more generous about breakfasts and usually provide vegetarians (and everyone else) with a full meal. Let me add that I complained about the breakfast on the GRU to ORD flight to an FA as gently as I could, and she very nicely supplied me with a regular breakfast. I urged my seatmate to do the same, and he just got angrier. I appreciated the reasonable-quality wine that United is now distributing for free in economy.",1

2016-07-05,0.2,Couple Leisure,First Class,LAX to ORD via LAX,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,a very poor excuse,False,"  Flew United Airlines, first class from Los Angeles - Chicago and return. Service was appalling, other than the wider seat, it may as well have been a coach trip. Shortly after take off, I asked one of the flight attendants for a second serving of nuts, to my shock, she said (actually ""snipped"" was more like it) ""no, we have only one serving per person"". For a first class ticket, you can't get a second thimble of nuts? When lunch was served, it seemed like it took forever,  two or three passengers were served after which there were long intervals before the next few passengers were served. There were those who were finishing before we'd even started. As to the preparation - there was not even an attempt to cover the fold up trays with a linen of any kind and the food was not good - unappetizing coach grade cafeteria fare. Internet in both directions was available for a charge - something like $3.99/hour. This, I've never heard of especially in first class. Nonetheless, I paid for the entire flight and could not get it to work in either direction. $20.00 wasted. The condition of the plane felt ok, solid and relatively new - though the electric plug at my seat was loose, and wouldn't hold a cord, the entire socket tipped out with the weight of the electric cord so that was unusable as well. The only redeeming value on the flight were the more comfortable seatings and the fact that the pilot seemed experienced. My question on this flight: other than the more comfortable seats - what did I pay for? This was a very poor excuse for what was supposed to be a first class flight.",-1

Worst lounge and worst food in Business Class that I have ever had. The company I work for always selects the cheapest business class flight from LHR to SFO and so I have tried quite a few - BA, Virgin etc. Apart from the seat that goes flat, United should be embarrassed to call this Business Class. I even had to pay for a Gin and Tonic in the ""Club"" Lounge, which was more full and far dirtier than the main airport. Never again. My team makes 200+ flights to SFO a year and I'm not going to let them go on United.",-1

These are ""economy premium"" seats, nothing more. I would never choose UA again voluntarily for transatlantic flights.

By far the most awful experience I have ever had! We were delayed due to sever weather and I know that was not controllable but we had a 4 hour layover in Houston and would have made it if the pilot and the crew didn't time out and they would have had a crew to take us, which by the way the crew would have times out in the air during the flight. We get to Houston and they have no outgoing flights at night so we have no way to leave until 8:45 am the next morning but they won't put us up for a night because according to them it isn't ""their problem, they cannot control the weather!""  We spent the night in an airport that was locked down, no food or restaurant open except for some sandwich shop and we hadn't ate since 9 this morning because we should have been home hours ago. Horrible customer service! The lady at our gate called for back up to help at least five times and not one person came.  The only nice thing we had happen was the night janitor got us some blankets because it was freezing in the airport and we had 9 hours to wait for our next flight. I will never take this airline again!",-1

2016-06-29,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CVG to ORF via ORD,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1,return trip was no better,False,"  My United Airlines flight departed CVG on time. However, upon arrival in Chicago I began receiving emails (I believe it was 5 in total) each one pushing my flight back later and later. There was no gate agent or anyone to assist me. In fact the pilot showed up and was as baffled as the passengers. I was supposed to land in Norfolk around 2122 hrs but did not land until after midnight. As a result the rental car company and I was forced to rent a car from another company. To add insult to injury the luggage was delayed coming off the plane. There was no one else at the airport so why the luggage would be delayed on top of the everything else is beyond me. Luggage and additional car rental fees aside, the delay impacted the amount of time I could spend with my family. The return trip was no better. I was delayed out of Norfolk with no communication letting me know of the delay. I was also delayed in Newark New Jersey. They had a plane with no crew. I was supposed to be back in Cincinnati by 1555 hrs. on Friday June 24. In actuality, I did not get back until 1940 hrs. To add injury to insult my luggage was on a separate flight which did not land until 2040 hrs. As a United Mileage Plus Explorer card holder and a member of their frequent flier program, I am extremely disappointed in the lack of service, communication or concern. I will be cancelling my membership and credit card and taking my business elsewhere.",-1

I fly over 150 segments a year with United. My complaint is not with the crew or flight attendants. They do a great job despite the problems. United continually has flights that are delayed and cancelled. And because all of their flights are booked to 100%, the delays cause serious problems getting to your destination. Many of these delays are mechanical or personnel in nature (awaiting pilot or crew). Obviously, when you are so heavily invested with an airline, they've got you. It is hard to give up the status earned over the years. But if I knew then what I know now, I would have invested in a different airline. Hopefully, you wont make a similar mistake.",-1

When it was Continental it was more predictable and better overal service. I have traveled back and forth from Italy and on each time delays for multiple hours with lack of information. Today I am traveling from Milan to Newark, flight UA18 with delays after delays for 3 plus hrs. Plane arrived at 9.27am for departure at 10.40am. It had damage to door but the took pictures and waiting for authorization from headquaters. Its almost 1pm and we are still waiting. No work on plane. Just crazy and lack of concern for their customers. United crew has told me no problem with plane. Now they just announced 2pm maybe. They had hours to adjust or change flights. This is the third trip they have done this. Don't fly them.",-1

We paid an additional $2500.00 for these seats and only once did we go left rather than right. Only once did we actually have a place to put our feet, only once did we not have to sit and watch 200 plus people board and crash into our seats, and only once did we have television screen to watch a movie. Also not even a pre-loaded movie device was provided on our way home from San Francisco to Chicago. Also on that flight, even though we had the first two seats on the plane, when breakfast was served, I received oatmeal instead of the omelette that I had requested. For the premium price we paid, this was not at all what I was expecting. So very disappointed in United Airlines.",-1

We like! So not having flown with United Airlines for a while but flown quite a few others, I was a bit let down with the entertainment system. Tiny screen about the area of a large cellphone but without the picture quality. So the announcement comes when I'm sat down that you can use their app to stream it from airplane wi-fi to your tablet. Excellent, my tablet has a great screen, I just have to download a 60mb app before we take off. 4G drops and it chugs along but I get the app before we take off. The app works fine but United, please, if you offer wifi streaming because you scrimped on the seatback screens it's tight-arsed in the extreme to not offer any method of charging the damn device like a USB port.",1

My flight was delayed out of Houston, they put me on another flight in order to catch my connecting flight, that got delayed 4 more times, they put me on yet another one, I got into Newark, where I was suppose to connect to Buffalo. I missed that flight. The next flight gets in at 2am. So I opted to just fly home and forgo my trip. It was a hell of a day. To top it off, my parents were stranded in Japan overnight when they flew with United. My whole in-law family got stranded in Italy for overnight this past summer with United. There seems to be a very sad consistent theme here. I will try all I can to avoid United from now on.",-1

The attendants were wonderful and accomodating, the food was satisfactory, plane was clean, restrooms very well maintained and Flat bed comfortable enough to sleep well with headphones on to reduce plane noises.

This flight was booked in Dec 2015 for a departure date of 20 May from Milwaukee to Honolulu. The seats I initially selected were not provided even though I paid the bill. What a mess and a headache going on for 3 hours getting this cleared up. I did not like the method for the WiFi connection. I had to pay an additional charge just to receive a video and still no Internet connection. The use of my own device and no way to maintain power. When I purchased food it was awful. I have traveled to Hawaii and back 6 times. This was the worst. Never will I utilize United Airlines again. At one time it may have been good, not anymore.",-1

The lack of punctuality is very disappointing for a multi-billion dollar company. Communication is essential in today's thriving consumer market which United Airlines fails to display on the event of delays. As a ""valued"" member of other airline companies, my first trip with UA is very disappointing.

Catering - meagre, mean, and distributed across the flight in a way that makes no sense and leaves you wondering who from United has actually been involved in this experience. 14.5 hour flight from Melbourne to Orlando via Los Angeles - 1st service less than an hour into the flight - a tiny main meal at 10.30 am in the morning. Eat it because you will be waiting another 12/13 hours before you will see any more food, and when that finally comes - look at what is delivered - a bread roll and an egg frittata. I thought I would distract myself with movies and TV but no, the entertainment system was not working - so was hungry and bored for 8 hours. The actual aircraft was nearly brand new and was terrific - a pity the only variables that United have to differentiate themselves with are all to the negative.",-1

The rep at United Airlines who booked our tickets to London said she also booked our tickets for Athens. Upon arriving in London, Aegean had no tickets for us to leave for Athens with the 12.15 (we had arrived in London at 11.30), they then put us on the 4.30 flight. Finally, we make it to our final destination at 12.30am, over 12 hours later because of United Airlines. Now we have no luggage and everyone is putting the fault on each other.

2016-06-08,0.1,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DEN to DUB via ORD,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,paid for a nightmare,False,  United Airlines flight delayed over two hours into Chicago. Missed flight into Dublin by 1/2 hr. When we got off the plane the wait for customer service was about 3 hours so any hope for a rebooking the same night was hopeless. When we finally got customer service they said the earliest flight they could accommodate was Sunday arriving Monday (it was Wednesday). Our total time in Dublin was only 4.5 days. After much persistence they booked us through Delta for us to arrive on Friday. Because of their delay we lost a day of our trip and had to pay for a hotel in Chicago. Now the real fun begins when we tried to address our luggage. The luggage department said they made arrangements for our bags to be transferred to Delta. Delta didn't have them when we went to check in. They called United who said they put them on our connecting flight that we missed. 4 days and 6 phone calls later I was told our luggage was in Dublin if we wanted to pick it up. We saved for a dream vacation and paid for a nightmare.,-1

The flight attendants are rude and completely inattentive. The food is mediocre and I'm not expecting much. The cabin itself is a filthy mess. A visit to the restroom midway across the Pacific and the floor is wet, it's smelly, there's tissue paper and seat covers all over the floor - I feel terrible for the individuals whom are seated next to toilets. The seat recline is next to non-existent and the seats themselves are hard and uncomfortable. I'll never fly intercontinental on United ever again and Domestic US travel is because of my desire to accumulate milage on Star Alliance carriers - otherwise I'd fly Delta.",-1

The flight departed on time and the service, both on the ground and inflight was attentive, unobtrusive and professional. The food was fantastic, with plenty of options. Entertainment was plentiful and kept us more than occupied for the duration of the flight. The seat was comfortable and the ability to lie flat was a real bonus on the inbound overnight flight. I would definitely recommend United BusinessFirst.",1

I will be swimming against the tide it seems to praise United, but I certainly intend to do that. Prior to boarding the flight in IAH a colleague fell ill. We advised the customer service centre of this and they immediately arranged for a paramedic. We spent some time in a local hospital and following discharge United rerouted us directly to our destination (previously we were flying via DEN) and provided upgraded Economy Plus boarding passes. All for no additional charge. When it came to the crunch they were fantastic. That's customer service.",1
2016-05-31,0.3,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,IAH to LAX,3.0,,3.0,,,1.0,3,4 hours of delays,False,"  Flew Houston to Los Angeles with United Airlines. 2 hour initial delay, then 2 more hours. 4 hours of delays due to maintenance, we were told too late so we couldn't get an earlier flight. Had to book a different rental car in LA which ended up costing me 100 dollars more than my intial car due to last minute reservations. 8 hours spent in the airport so I had to spend money on expensive airport food. Explained that to customer service, no apology, nothing. Maybe this is normal for United. The plane itself was fine, to be fair. Good space and friendly service in my experience. It's inexcusable to me not to compensate our flight in some way for this huge delay. Never flying United again.",-1

At 11.37pm, we were told that there was no working crew for the flight and that they needed to call in a different crew. Can't blame the informer but this is ridiculous.

2016-05-29,0.1,Business,Economy Class,MXP to MCO via EWR,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,meals were of poor quality,False,"  Landed at Newark on UA18 from Milan–Malpensa, I had to board my connecting flight to Orlando UA730 scheduled for 2.55 pm. Despite an early landing in Milan, due to the lenghty custom procedures and the unavailability of the United Airlines personnel to assist me in expediting the process, despite my desperate running through the airport, I reached the gate too late for boarding. I had to take the later flight at 3.55. I missed a meeting in Orlando. The staff at the UA customer service desk were very unpleasant and were not be co-operative at all. I have to add that the 8.5 hour flight from MXP to Newark was also very unconfortable with poor quality food and noisy company. I complained to customer service and received a free ticket for a future flight with United for the value of 150 US Dollars. However, 6 days later, when on my way back to Italy from Florida I asked the UA personnel at MCO-Orlando to upgrade my ticket from Newark to Milano Malpensa UA19 to a business class ticket. The attendant at the counter told me that there were seats available, but an upgrade for my ticket was not available nor could I use the free ticket United gave me. If I wished to fly business class, I had to buy a new ticket. On my return flight (UA19) to Milan MXP from Newark on May 26, 2016 I again tried without success to get a more comfortable seat than the one assigned 45C (the very last seat on the rear right next to the lavatory). However, the cabin was full and the overbooking issue caused a delay in the departure. Despite my express request not to be seated near children or babies, I had a newborn sitting a couple of rows ahead of me. Luckily, he did not scream at all during the flight. Meals were of poor quality, as it was on the other flights of UA, were served and the crew ran out of red wine very early on. Due to the very overcrowded condition of the flight, I could only sleep a couple of hours thanks to the courtesy of a flight attendant who gave me earplugs.",-1
2016-05-29,0.6,Business,First Class,YVR to DCA via ORD,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5,unacceptably rude behavior,False,"  UA3345, Chicago - Washington on an E-175. Operated for United Airlines by Republic Airlines. This was the last leg of a nearly one-month trip that took me from PHL-DOH-KWI-DOH-PVG-DOH-KWI-DOH-LAX-YVR-ORD and now home to Washington. Of course, only on an American carrier do I find myself being spoken rudely to by member of the cabin crew. After boarding and taking my seat 2A (single seat by the window), I went to use the forward lavatory. The cockpit door was wide open with the captain, a young woman, sitting sideways in her seat. I greeted her and we started chatting. She was very interested to hear of several recent flights I’d had on the new A350 operated by QR. The FA in the first galley, interrupted me to say, “excuse me sir, you are in my space”. I replied, “I’m speaking with the captain” and moved slightly closer to the lavatory door. The captain and I chatted for a few more moments, then I went into the lavatory. Before the lavatory door was even shut, I heard the FA staying loudly to the captain, “I’m sorry, he just started talking to you”. I came out of the lavatory and said, “What is it that you are sorry for? I can speak to the captain before the door is closed and we push back from the gate. She was quite happy to have a conversation with me”. The FA said nothing. I went to my seat. The FA then came to ask me if I wanted something to drink pre-departure. I told her that it was rude of her to say what she said to the captain in a loud voice and that she could, at the least, have said once I was out of earshot. Before I had even finished speaking she just walked away from me. She came back to my seat and I asked her, “do you always just walk away while a passenger is speaking to you”. She mumbled something which wasn’t anything close to an apology. Unacceptably rude behavior and bad attitude toward a premium passenger in a first class cabin. Not such a nice ending to a long multi-segment trip.",1

United's service has been on a continued downhill spiral since United bought Continental Airlines. I was a loyal and proud Continental Airlines customer before the buyout. I have reluctantly continued to fly United because the connections from Houston are still the best there is. However, the service is appalling. On this most recent trip I was changed a hefty 2nd bag fee. Even though my expensive United Club card allowed me 2 free bags and the code-share partner, ANA allows for 2 free bags.  United has lost my ticket. As well as many other instances of mishandling by United.

I recently flew with United to Oklahoma to visit relatives, in May. When we did our self check in. We all had separate seats even my 3yr old daughter! I went to ask for assistance and was given the ""we can't assist you with your seats, then she points to the sign ""bag drop off only"". She then said go sort yourself out at the gate. we got to the gate, and waited for someone to assist us at the service desk. When someone finally appeared. We asked if they could help us with the seating arrangements, because how could they seat a child on their own. We were told they couldn't help with seating arrangements we needed to go to the ticketing desk, which was on the other side of the terminal! we were told we can go ask people to move so we could sit next to my daughter. Frustrating! Then before boarding we were stopped by the gate boarding attendant and was told we had too many bags! We are allowed two bags per person. There was four of us, we had seven bags. She made my mum ruffle around to consolidate our bags, but I told the attendant that my daughter is a person and we paid full price for her, She (my daughter) is allowed two bags! 2x4=8! The attendant then looked at me blankly and just let us through not even apologising for her mistake! Rude! A week later my parents return trip from Oklahoma was booked with United airlines. When they got there (their English is limited) they asked for assistance with the self check in. The two ladies that went to help them, told my parents they had too many bags. Again! My mum had two bags, dad the same. Mum was holding her jacket and a travel pillow for the flight. They bullied my parents to the point, that my mum said she didn't want any more hassle and was happy to pay for the baggage fee. My mum had only cash, but they told my mum they don't accept cash, only credit card! By this time it was almost boarding time for them, then a supervisor of the airline came to see what was the fuss, the supervisor told my parents that they can go because they have the correct amount of bags - just plain rudeness! No customer service! Would never recommend anyone to fly with them! United airlines horrible! If I had a choice I wouldn't give them one star!",-1

There was an mechanical problem with the door so the passengers were diverted to other flights. The purpose of my trip was to attend my brother's funeral, I had to be there on time. I explained my need to get to Minnesota before 1:30 and the AUS attendant got me onto the next flight to Houston to make the next flight to MSP which was scheduled to arrive at 1:17pm. The National Cemetery is right next to the airport and the time is approximately 10 minutes from the airport to the cemetery via the highway. At Houston, I asked the attendant if I could be off the plane first when it arrived at MSP. She said ""No"" but she did move my seat assignment closer to the door. I also asked if they could request a sky cab/cart upon landing so it could take me to the taxi cab stands located outside the airport. They made those arrangements for me. Fortunately the plane arrived 10 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time. The sky cab/cart arrived just as I got into the terminal. The driver whisked me as close as he could to the taxi cab stands and explained the quickest way to get to the taxis. I want to thank all attendants, the MSP cab/cart driver and the taxi cab driver for getting me to my brother's funeral 5 minutes before the 1:30 start time.",1

The conveyor didn't work to load the baggage and the crew were not around to unplug it in order to restart it. It's 10.30pm and we are still stuck at the gate. We've had to book a hotel in SF and forget about our 2 hour drive home tonight or should I say tomorrow morning. This after having to upgrade to a premium seat for my wife because her seat was never assigned when the flight was booked online. Our current compensation for extra $ spent in the upgrade and the $150 needed for the room and the 9.5 hour delay - a $10 food voucher. No fault of the nice people at the desk and on board, but never flying United again.",-1
2016-05-02,0.7,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,EWR to LHR,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,4,my first experience with UA,False,"  Overnight flight from Newark to Heathrow. We upgraded to premium economy for this flight and it was my first experience with UA. Boarding was smooth, assigned a row to join which was marked on the boarding pass. Welcomed on board and found the seats, two of us travelling and we discovered that no one was assigned to the third seat in our row which made it a bit more comfortable. Legroom was good although seat width felt a bit narrow and looked to be the same as economy. That was about it in the way of 'perks' compared to economy as far as I could see. As for the flight, one hour delay in taking off and strong winds delayed our arrival. Good choice of entertainment. Meals were reasonable and I managed to get a brief nap. I had a look at the economy legroom and it looked poor, so I was glad we upgraded but I would class it as only extra legroom rather than a premium product.",1
2016-04-30,0.3,Business,Business Class,EWR to MUC,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2,experience feels cheap,False,"  Newark to Munich with United Airlines business class. The whole experience feels cheap and anything but Premier. Had to wait 45 mins for security at Newark despite Premier lane access. The lounge was overcrowded with hardly a selection of food and drinks all served in plastic; staff were unfriendly and most alcoholic drinks chargeable. Onboard the plane was showing its age, the BusinessFirst seat however is comfy. Staff decent but it took them ages to complete dinner service on a flight of hardly more than seven hours. No pre take off drink offer nor water at seat so left thirsty for more than an hour after take off. Thankfully flight was on time. Overall would not repeat nor recommend.",-1

Their online check-in did not work, so for our 8 hour long trip to Germany my husband and I ended up sitting in separate rows although the flight was not full! The airline was trying to squeeze $169 per person out of us to sit next to each other in Premium Economy, but gave away free seat upgrades to Business class! How is there not something wrong with this picture? The worst customer service.",-1

We experienced a weather delay. storms in Las Vegas prior to departure. The captain let us off the aircraft and the gate team gave us updates every 15 minutes on what was happening. Even when the gate staff changed shift the updates keep happening. It was very professional and made the delay manageable. Onboard service was great and despite being a 43 minute flight a quick beverage and snack service. Surprising as the cabin crew had to ran to make this happen.",1

Paid extra for a 6:30 flight when 8:30 was much cheaper but because this is a work related trip I didn't want to arrive to Dallas after midnight. One boarded we were asked to deplane due to window issues, then we were told that a swap aircraft is needed. 3 hours later still waiting for the aircraft. No vouchers or complementary water, tea, coffee as provided because the delay was under 4 hours. Even though it was 3.5 hours delayed and people paid extra for this specific flight versus any other flights. Awful customer service!",-1
2016-04-16,0.9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LAS to DUB via IAD,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,service on all sectors was great,False,"  We travelled with United Airlines in Domestic First and International Business class from Las Vegas to Dublin via Washington, the return leg of an earlier DUB-IAD-SAN booking. Checked in at LAS at a staffed desk, this was quick friendly and efficient. After security, which was quiet at the time of the process, we made our way to the Lounge for a 1+ hour wait. Plenty of drinks and nibbles were available and the food area was clean and tidy. It was too early in the day to use the bar! Boarding was by the standard UA ‘Group’ System, and being in the first group as stated the boarding pass this was completely painless. On board welcome drinks were offered prior to departure. Meal orders for lunch were also taken. After departure we noticed that the aircraft appeared to level off a bit early and that turns were being made over the Lake Mead area. This manoeuvre lasted for about 10+minutes which we found to be slightly alarming. My co-traveller mentioned this to one of the FAs who advised that ‘systems’ were being checked. No flight deck announcement was ever made on this situation. Once the aircraft started to climb again and it was obvious that the aircraft was on course for IAD we were able to relax more and enjoy the well presented lunch and numerous top ups of wine! In spite of the unusual post departure manoeuvres the flight arrived at the gate in IAD a few minutes early. We checked the gate number for the onward DUB flight which was departing a few gates away on the same concourse. We were able to use the UA lounge at IAD for a short stay, this facility was heaving at the time of our mid evening visit so perhaps not so enjoyable. Boarding for Dublin flight commenced about 20 minutes late due to the aircraft's delay from a previous flight. On board the FA in charge greeted each Business-First passenger, and as on the previous sector drinks were service prior to departure along with orders for dinner. Inflight, dinner and more drinks were served. Having eaten earlier there was actually too much food on offer! We did notice that most fellow travellers had skipped the final cheese and desert courses to try and get some sleep. Around 1.5 hours out of Dublin a breakfast was served. The aircraft arrived 10 minutes early. From the gate it was a fair walk along corridors to the immigration and customs area which was near empty at the time of our visit. To conclude, the service on all sectors was great. The tickets purchased in ‘P’ booking class which originated in Dublin were competitively priced, and worth the extra trip from Edinburgh.",1

2016-04-14,0.2,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,GUA to IAH,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,1,going to be delayed again,False,"  New York to Guatemala via Houston return. If you are ever traveling in a hurry, do not travel with United Airlines. On my way there I lost an entire day due to maintenance or something wrong with the plane. But they wouldn't tell you until is too late to catch another flight. At the end I was supposed to be at my final destination at 11 am - I made it until 11 pm. To compensate my lost day United Airlines throw me a 2 digit quantity voucher. I guess is the best they can do for you if they feel you deserve it and that's what you are worth to them. On my way back I had the same issue I was informed right before getting on the plane that they were going under maintenance and we were going to be delayed again. Although we made it on time, I had to share my experience.",-1
2016-04-14,0.7,Business,First Class,IAD to MEL via LAX,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4,improvement might just continue,False,"  Washington to Melbourne via Los Angeles with United - the worst things about this route are the terminals and the United Clubs. D terminal at IAD is little better than a Quonset hut with carpeting, and Terminal 7 at LAX is a smelly, dirty disgrace made even worse by blaring security announcements every few minutes. The United Clubs in both places are old, tatty, dirty and full of people having loud, self-important conversations on cellphones since UA does nothing to regulate this kind of conduct. The Boeing 772 service to LAX was fully loaded, boarding was orderly, except that the cabin crew did nothing to assist disabled passengers to get seated and sorted before the rest of us got on. It was the same with disembarkation at LAX, so the aisles were brought to a standstill by poor people with physical limits trying to get on and off with the rest of us. The 772 was old and showing it. Things did not work. My IFE system went on the fritz. An FA willingly reset it and then checked, and when it still did not recover, gave me a coupon which I later used online to add 5,000 points to my Mileage Plus account. The inflight wifi also did not work for me 90 percent of the time, but my neighbour could use it it, albeit with very slow up and down speeds. One has to apply online for a refund. The Boeing 787 LAX-MEL was still new and fully functional, and this time the food was edible, though the portions were minuscule, and with dinner service about 1 hour after lift off and breakfast about 1 hour before landing, the 12-13 hours without food in between seemed long, even to me who is not a big eater, though one can buy food from the food for purchase menu. The crew on this leg were short on customer service skills, barking out requests, never a ""please"" or ""thank you"" and not a single hydration round. They seemed pretty sour about something, but when I went to the rear galley to find an empty restroom, a few of them were sitting around and chatting in a very jovial way with each other. Toilets not maintained at all for the 15 hours. Even so, we were on time, things went efficiently, the IFE choices were good, and the IFE system on the B789 was very good. If the hard product on the old 772s is upgraded and the effort to promote customer service skills among cabin crew continues, the improvement in United's service I've noticed over the last couple of years might just continue.",1
2016-04-13,0.2,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,MAN to MIA via EWR,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,2.0,1,very rude cabin staff,False,"  We had 4 flights with United Airlines, first flight was from Manchester UK to Newark. We were promised a baby crib at check-in, then told that they only had one onboard and someone else had it, no infant seat belts so baby just sat on your our lap - dreadful service. On 2nd internal flight from Newark to Miami, 3 seats allocated to us were scatted throughout the plane, we are a family of 2 adults 1 child (5) and a baby. This should not be allowed and after complaining they gave us 3 together. Service onboard was much better than the international flight with great attendants. 3rd internal flight Miami to Newark the worst with very rude staff on the check-in desk who ignored us for about 10-15 minutes. Again we requested an infant cot for our international flight and were told we had it as we were one of the first to check in, flight delayed and only just made our connection to 4th flight by seconds. Asked for our sky cot only to be told sorry someone asked for it on the plane and they had given it to them. I said I was unhappy as we requested it 6hrs ago and were met with very rude cabin staff. A very unpleasant experience throughout.",-1

Each flight was delayed by over an hour. They book flights to close together trying to get in as many as they can which causes all of the flights to be delayed. They also overbook the flights with no space for carry on luggage. Passengers are squeezed in like sardines with no leg room unless you are on a isle seat and put your legs in the isle! Due to the delays and cramped conditions, many passengers are irritated and make the flight frustrating for all others on board. It's like a powder keg just waiting to explode.

However the timing for the flight was not that good as the flight departs Singapore at 5am in the morning. The aircraft cabin was quite clean and the seats were comfortable, the flight attendants were friendly when serving food and drinks to passengers. There was a choice of chicken noodles and scrambled eggs for the in-flight meal, I chose chicken noodles for my meal, unfortunately it was not to my liking as the noodles were too dry. The Inflight entertainment was really unresponsive and difficult to use but overall it was still a pleasant flight with United and I will definitely fly with them again in future.",1

Apart from a genuinely appalling luncheon out of Melbourne, and rubbish food for sale on the domestic leg, I found everything efficient, punctual, and as comfortable as one can expect in Economy Plus - which is more economy than plus. But the extra leg room and earlier boarding and disembarkation is what I want, not frills. The Boeing 787 was new, in excellent condition, clean, seats quite comfortable for me, and a very good IFE product. Similarly with the Boeing 737-900 from LAX to IAD. Mature, pragmatic FAs: you know they know what to do, but charm is not always in it. Inflight wifi was not exactly cheap and tended to drop out over Samoa, but who doesn't? Otherwise very reliable. I've been flying UA for 30 years now, and have a lot of miles with them under my belt, and I have almost always found the airline functional, clean, and reliable,",1

I had a 6 am flight booked to go to Houston then Cozumel an hour after. We were then told the flight was then delayed by 8 hours (supposed to leave around 2 in in the afternoon but I later checked and and it didn't leave until 5). No one expalined the situation until 2 hours later. There was no apologies or complimentary coffee to help make the long wait bearable. I understand that is always a risk when flying but I waited in line for over 4 hours to be rebooked onto a flight and given a hotel voucher so vague not even the staff at Dallas could tell me what to do (I would be in Cozumel a day late). No information on the hotel number or address or shuttle. Just the name and there were two in the city. Not being from the US I then had to use roaming charges to try and find my reservation. There was no reservation at either and no shuttle according to the hotel. Just take my advice and pay a little extra if you can for a different airline because I would not wish this situation on anyone.,-1

The inflight entertainment was inoperable in all of the segments which is indicative of how much United it letting it's equipment fall apart. The business class seats to sit in are comfy, but the recline pitch is so insignificant that we were unable to catch any sleep on what was a very long trip. Being 6ft 2 inches my leg room was primarily found under the seat in front of me. When my seat mate needed to go to the washroom, the dynamic was equaled to the struggles of the same issue in economy. We got only one meal outbound and inbound and the rest of the time is was saly snacks with only one attempt at beverage services. It reminded me of what the economy class used to be. Paying big money for this service is unethical. So now it's time to take my business elsewhere. Travelers be warned!!",-1

If you find a cheap ticket, by all means take it, but you have to forget about customer service. The attendants are not going to give a damn about you. I asked for a glass of water and I was told to wait until they would come around with the cart which happened half an hour later. They promise wifi but most of the time it doesn't work.

2016-03-26,0.3,Business,Economy Class,EWR to AVP,2.0,,5.0,,,3.0,2,disregard for its customers,False,"  United Flight 4914 from EWR to AVP, March 24 2016. Our flight was delayed for something like two hours because of United's incompetence and inability to have a plane and crew ready for a scheduled flight. When the plane finally arrived at about 23:40 (the scheduled departure was 22:06), we were put onto a bus that drove us 50 or 100 yards (walking distance) onto the tarmac. We were then stranded in the bus for 35 minutes with no explanation, and not allowed to get off the bus. In other words, United doubled down on its incompetence and unreliability by further inconveniencing its passengers by directing them to board a bus and then demonstrating what I construe as willful and intentional contempt for the passengers by stranding them in the bus with no explanation. I recall that one person had to ask to use the toilet before the flight left because, even though most people probably did so before being told to board, the delay due to the airline's incompetence and disregard for its customers resulted in the need to do so again.",-1
